(a)	 At the meeting described in paragraph 6.2.9, the Contractor shal,1 carefully<br /><br />
consider and take into account the proposals of the Government and the<br /><br />
reasons therefor and shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with<br /><br />
the Government on the points at issue paying particular 00 sideration to the<br /><br />
objective of achieving initial commercial production expeditiously taking into<br /><br />
account generally accepted engineering practices and economics of the<br /><br />
international petroleum industry.<br /><br />
(b)	 If the Government and the Contractor agree upon the boundaries of the araa<br /><br />

work programme budget for the development of the discovery, the date upon<br /><br />
which such agreement is reached, as reflected in writing signed by both<br /><br />
parties, shall be the date of the declaration of the commeroial discovery for all<br /><br />
purposes of this Contract. The area so determined shall,. on such date. be<br /><br />
automatically converted into a field, and the Contractor shall, as soon as is<br /><br />
practicable, commence development and production operations in the field<br /><br />
according to the adopted work programme and work programm.e bUdget.<br /><br />
Upon adoption of the development work programme and work rogramme<br /><br />
bUdget, the annual work programme and work programme budget adopted<br /><br />
pursuant to paragraph 5.4 shall be revised accordingly.<br /><br />

Government or the Contractor may refer the matter for determination by a<br /><br />
Sole Expert. The determination by a Sole Expert in accordance with this<br /><br />
paragraph shall be final and the work programme and work programme<br /><br />
budget for the development of the discovery and the boundaries of he area<br /><br />
to be delineated as a field, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have<br /><br />

For purposes of this paragraph, "net realized price" means the price realized at<br /><br />
the delivery point as calculated! by adjusting the price actuaUy received at the<br /><br />
point of sale with allowable deductions. In calculating the net realized price<br /><br />
deductions may only be made for (a) transportation costs between th,e delivery<br /><br />
poin~	 and the point of sale, (b) commissions and brokerages, and (c) handling<br /><br />
charges; and the deductions shall be limited to amounts that do not Bxceed<br /><br />
customary and prevailing rates charged therefor in the international oil industry<br /><br />
between independent parties in arm's length commercial transactions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2	 Crude oil sold by the Contractor in sales other than arm's length commercial<br /><br />
transactions shall be valued by reference to world market prices of comparable<br /><br />
crude oils sold in arm's length commercial transactions for export in the major<br /><br />
world petroleum markets, and adjusted for oil quality, location and conditions of<br /><br />
pricing, delivery and payment.<br /><br />
10.3	 Natural gas shall be valued in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 14.4.<br /><br />
10.4	 Sales in arm's length commercial transactions referred to in this Article shall<br /><br />

sh'all separately apply to each segregated crude oil. However, in electing to take<br /><br />
crude oil for internal consumption pursuant to paragraph 11.7 and to take royalty<br /><br />
