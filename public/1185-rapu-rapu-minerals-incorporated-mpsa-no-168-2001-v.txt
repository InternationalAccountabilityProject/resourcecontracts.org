<br><br />
Government acknowledges to be acceptable notwithstanding<br><br />
that the sale<br><br />
<br><br />
price of the minerals and by-products may from time to time<br><br />
be lower, or<br><br />
<br><br />
the terms and conditions of sales are less favorable, than<br><br />

shipment of mineral product is made, existing and future<br><br />
marketing<br><br />
<br><br />
contract(s)/sales agreement(s) shall be submitted to the<br><br />

<br><br />
Sales and Inventory of Minerals, as well as in the<br><br />
lntegrated Annual<br><br />
<br><br />
Report, the corresponding registration number(s) of the<br><br />
marketing<br><br />

9.2. Government's Examination and Revision of Work Program -<br><br />
Should the<br><br />
<br><br />
Government decide to propose a revision to a certain<br><br />
specific feature in the<br><br />
<br><br />
Work Program or Budget, it shall, within thirty (30) days<br><br />
after receipt<br><br />
<br><br />
thereof, provide a Notice to the Contractor specifying in<br><br />

<br><br />
Work Program and Budget proposed by the Contractor shall be<br><br />
deemed to<br><br />
<br><br />
be approved.<br><br />
<br><br />
 <br><br />
<br><br />
9.3. Contractor's Changes to Work Program - It is recognized<br><br />
by the<br><br />
<br><br />
Government and the Contractor that the details of any Work<br><br />
Program may<br><br />
<br><br />
require changes in the light of changing circumstances. The<br><br />
Contractor<br><br />
<br><br />
may make such changes: Provided, That it shall not change<br><br />
the general<br><br />
<br><br />
objective of the Work Program: Provided further, That<br><br />
changes which entail<br><br />
<br><br />
a negative variance of at least twenty percent (20%) shall<br><br />
be subject to the<br><br />
<br><br />
approval of the Director.<br><br />
<br><br />
 <br><br />
<br><br />
In case of any positive variance, the Contractor shall<br><br />
submit to the Director,<br><br />
<br><br />
through the Regional Director concerned, a copy each of the<br><br />
Work<br><br />
<br><br />
Programs, for information.<br><br />
<br><br />
 <br><br />
<br><br />
9.4. The Government's approval of a proposed Work Program<br><br />
and Budget will<br><br />
<br><br />
not be unreasonably withheld.<br><br />
