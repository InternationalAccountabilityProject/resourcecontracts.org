 the continuation of drilling by the use of appropriate equipment; -                                 <br /><br /><br />

 protection, the laying of casing preventing the minimum contractual depth                           <br /><br /><br />

Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, NOCAL and the                           <br /><br /><br />

technical conditions in accordance with good international petroleum industry                          <br /><br /><br />

drilled and/or the amount of seismic data acquired by the Contractor during such                       <br /><br /><br />

 a Consultative Committee for Natural Gas shall be established by the Parties                       <br /><br /><br />
