Subject to the provisions as hereinafter provided in this Contract, this<br /><br />
Contract shall be for a fixed term of thirty-five (35) years or the<br /><br />
period of validity of the MTJA Agreement, whichever is the earlier,<br /><br />
commencing from the Effective Date.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contract Area shall, on the Effective Date, encompass Block A-18 in<br /><br />
the Joint Development Area under the MTJA Act 1990, an area bounded on<br /><br />
the east by the eastern boundary of the Joint Development Area under the<br /><br />
MTJA Act 1990, on the west by the western boundary of the Joint<br /><br />
Development Area under the MTJA Act 1990, on the north by the 7 DEG. 18'<br /><br />
N latitude, and on the south by the 7 DEG. 00' N latitude, and shall be<br /><br />
divided into nine (9) Sub-blocks as shown on the map of Block A-18 as<br /><br />
appears in Appendix A.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The exploration activities in respect of Petroleum Operations shall<br /><br />
commence not later than one (1) month from the date of approval by MTJA<br /><br />
of the first Work Programme and Budget referred to in Article 3.1.<br /><br />
Each Sub-block shall cease to be part of the Contract Area if no Crude<br /><br />
Oil in a Commercial Quantity is found therein within five (5) years from<br /><br />
the Effective Date with the exception of any area defined as a Gas Field<br /><br />
in accordance with Article 8.1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-17The Contractors may apply to MTJA for permission to retain such<br /><br />
Sub-block for further exploration for an agreed time period, provided<br /><br />
that additional work commitment for that Sub-block is proposed by<br /><br />
Contractors and agreed upon by MTJA.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When Crude Oil is discovered in a Commercial Quantity in a Sub-block,<br /><br />
that Sub-block is automatically converted into and forms part of a<br /><br />
Development Area to which shall be added other Sub-block or Sub-blocks<br /><br />
as and when Crude Oil is discovered in a Commercial Quantity in the<br /><br />
Sub-block or Sub-blocks; and wherever it is established that the Crude<br /><br />
Oil so discovered is from an Oil Field which straddles over two (2) or<br /><br />
more Sub-blocks within the Contract Area those Sub-blocks in which the<br /><br />
Oil Field is located are also automatically converted into and form part<br /><br />
of the Development Area. Contractors shall submit a Development Plan for<br /><br />
Oil Field(s) to MTJA for its consideration at least sixty (60) days<br /><br />
prior to submission of the relevant Work Programme and Budget or any<br /><br />
revisions thereof.<br /><br />
MTJA shall consider such Development Plan without delay. MTJA shall not<br /><br />
unreasonably require any changes to such Development Plan, and in<br /><br />
particular will not require changes which, in Contractors' opinion,<br /><br />
materially increase the cost of development of an Oil Field. If a<br /><br />
Development Plan has not received MTJA's approval within ninety (90)<br /><br />
days of submittal, the period of time from the expiration of said ninety<br /><br />
(90) days until MTJA's approval is received shall be added to the five<br /><br />
(5) years referred to below.<br /><br />

indirectly, from any Sub-block or Sub-blocks in which an Oil Field is<br /><br />
located in the Development Area within five (5) years from the date when<br /><br />
the Sub-block or Sub-blocks were converted into a Development Area, that<br /><br />
Sub-block or Sub-blocks shall be deemed to be relinquished to MTJA and<br /><br />
cease to be part of the Contract Area unless Contractors can reasonably<br /><br />
demonstrate to MTJA that the delays are due to circumstances beyond<br /><br />
Contractors' control or that the delay is at MTJA's request.<br /><br />
Any Sub-block which is not defined as a Development Area and any area<br /><br />
which is not a Gas Field as defined in accordance with Article 8.1 at<br /><br />
the end of five (5) years from the Effective Date shall be deemed to be<br /><br />
relinquished to MTJA and cease to be part of the Contract Area.<br /><br />
2.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The First Commercial Production Of Crude Oil from any Oil Field in a<br /><br />
Development Area automatically converts the Sub-block or Sub-blocks in<br /><br />
which the Oil Field is located into a Production Area to which shall be<br /><br />
added other Sub-block or Sub-blocks as and when the First Commercial<br /><br />
Production of Crude Oil from new Oil Fields takes place and if such Oil<br /><br />
Field straddles over two (2) or more Sub-blocks within the Contract Area<br /><br />
those Sub-blocks are automatically converted into and form part of the<br /><br />
Production Area.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
till the expiry of the term of this Contract,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
whichever is the earlier. Provided however in the event Contractors<br /><br />
effect the First Commercial Production of Crude Oil from the Sub-block<br /><br />
or Sub-blocks before the expiry of the relevant development period for<br /><br />
such Sub-block or Sub-blocks the balance of that development period<br /><br />
shall be added to the above production period. Upon the termination of<br /><br />
the production period for any Sub-block or Sub-blocks as hereinabove<br /><br />
described, such Sub-block or Sub-blocks shall be deemed to have been<br /><br />
relinquished forthwith to MTJA.<br /><br />
It shall be agreed between the Parties that any production of Crude Oil<br /><br />
and Associated Gas beyond the above production period, as the case may<br /><br />
<br /><br />
be, shall be on terms and conditions to be agreed by MTJA.<br /><br />
2.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors may after consulting MTJA surrender any Sub-block of the<br /><br />
Contract Area provided that written notice is given to MTJA six (6)<br /><br />
months before the date of the intended surrender without stipulating any<br /><br />
condition in relation to such surrender. Such surrender shall not in any<br /><br />
way operate to relieve Contractors from any liabilities which arise on<br /><br />
surrender thereof or subsisting prior to such surrender.<br /><br />

PETROLEUM OPERATIONS<br /><br />
3.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors within ten (10) weeks from the Effective Date shall submit<br /><br />
for the approval of MTJA the first Work Programme and Budget setting<br /><br />
forth the Petroleum Operations which Contractors propose to carry out<br /><br />
and initiate until 31st December 1994. For the subsequent years,<br /><br />
Contractors shall submit before 1st October of each Calendar Year, for<br /><br />
approval of MTJA, a Work Programme and Budget setting forth the<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations which Contractors propose to carry out and initiate<br /><br />
during the next Calendar Year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each activity, namely exploration, development and production shall<br /><br />
have its own Work Programme and Budget.<br /><br />
Each Work Programme and Budget shall set out in detail by quarterly<br /><br />
period all aspects of the proposed Petroleum Operations to be carried<br /><br />
out including all relevant data and information and estimated costs,<br /><br />
duration of each operation for each project and in the case of a Work<br /><br />
Programme for a Production Area, the estimated monthly rate of<br /><br />
production for each Oil Field or Gas Field. Such Work Programme shall<br /><br />
also include measures to be taken by Contractors to comply with the<br /><br />
obligations as specified in Article 3.8.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-22Details of each Work Programme and Budget shall be in such form as<br /><br />
required by MTJA. Each Work Programme and Budget shall include forecast<br /><br />
of yearly activity and expenditure for the four (4) year period<br /><br />
following the end of the relevant Calendar Year or the period up to<br /><br />
termination of this Contract, whichever is shorter.<br /><br />
3.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Petroleum Operations shall be carried out unless and until the<br /><br />
relevant Work Programme and Budget have been approved in writing by<br /><br />
MTJA. MTJA shall notify Contractors of its approval (whether or not<br /><br />
conditional) or otherwise, of a proposed Work Programme and Budget:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the first Work<br /><br />
Programme and Budget;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by 15th December of the previous year, in respect of each<br /><br />
subsequent Work Programme and Budget.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MTJA may give notice to Contractors that a proposed Work Programme and<br /><br />
Budget submitted by Contractors is approved subject to such conditions<br /><br />
as MTJA may specify in such notice and may give Contractors notice that<br /><br />
a proposed Work Programme is to be revised either in whole or in part.<br /><br />
If Contractors consider that any revision required by MTJA renders the<br /><br />
Work Programme and Budget non-commercial, or is in excess of the minimum<br /><br />
work expenditure as set forth in Article 3.5 during the exploration<br /><br />
period, Contractors shall within thirty (30) days notify and<br /><br />
substantiate to MTJA its reasons for coming to such a decision.<br /><br />
Thereupon, MTJA and Contractors shall meet and discuss the revision<br /><br />
required by MTJA with a view to resolving any differences. If the<br /><br />
Parties fail to resolve their differences within sixty (60) days from<br /><br />
the date of the<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-23first of such meeting then, notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractors<br /><br />
shall incorporate the revisions required by MTJA into the proposed Work<br /><br />
Programme and Budget submitted by Contractors under this Article 3.3,<br /><br />
provided, however, that such change shall not increase or decrease the<br /><br />
Budget as proposed by Contractors of any affected expenditure item by<br /><br />
more than ten per cent (10%) and does not substantially alter the<br /><br />
general objectives of the Work Programme as submitted by Contractors.<br /><br />
All costs relating to exploration activity, including appraisal, of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations shall be recoverable as Cost Oil or Cost Gas, or<br /><br />
both, in a manner as specified in Article 5.1(b) or Article 8.5(b),<br /><br />
provided that such costs are part of the Work Programme and Budget which<br /><br />
have been approved by MTJA in accordance with paragraph one of Article<br /><br />
3.3.<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, MTJA<br /><br />
shall have the right to review the proposed level of production in<br /><br />
respect of any proposed or approved annual Work Programme and may, upon<br /><br />
written notification, request Contractors to increase or decrease the<br /><br />
rate of production from any Oil Field or Fields located in a Production<br /><br />
Area for any of the following reasons:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to optimise oil and gas recovery;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to minimise wastage of Associated Gas and to prevent wastage of<br /><br />
Non-associated Gas;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for safety considerations;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-24(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for operational considerations; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for Malaysian and/or Thai national interest considerations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon receipt of such written notification, Contractors shall forthwith<br /><br />
comply with such requests.<br /><br />
It is hereby agreed that for any decrease in the rate of production for<br /><br />
reasons under (v) above, arrangements will be made for Contractors to<br /><br />
recover at a later date from the Oil Field or Fields within the Contract<br /><br />
Area the quantity of Crude Oil equal to the decreased production.<br /><br />
It is recognised by MTJA and Contractors that the details of a Work<br /><br />
Programme may require changes in the light of changing circumstances;<br /><br />
thus Contractors may without the prior approval of MTJA make minor<br /><br />
changes, provided that such changes shall not increase or decrease the<br /><br />
approved Budget for any affected expenditure items by more than ten per<br /><br />
cent (10%) and do not substantially alter the general objectives of the<br /><br />
Work Programme. MTJA shall be notified of such changes as soon as<br /><br />
possible. Any other changes shall require the prior written approval of<br /><br />
MTJA. Any decision by MTJA on such application shall be communicated to<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors within sixty (60) days of receipt of the same.<br /><br />
3.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To satisfy Malaysian and/or Thai national interest MTJA may, within a<br /><br />
Work Programme and Budget or separately, give notice in writing to<br /><br />
Contractors requiring them:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-25(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to develop a petroleum deposit (except during the exploration<br /><br />
period) considered by Contractors to be non-commercial and lying<br /><br />
outside the proven, probable and possible areal extent of any<br /><br />
Oil Field or Gas Field reviewed and agreed to by MTJA and<br /><br />
developed by Contractors and not otherwise subject to an<br /><br />
on-going appraisal programme or any pending appraisal programme<br /><br />
of Contractors which has been approved by MTJA; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to execute specific works or build specific facilities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within sixty (60) days after receiving such notice, Contractors shall<br /><br />
amend the Work Programme and Budget appropriately. Expenditure incurred<br /><br />
as a result of MTJA's requirement under this Article 3.4 shall be fully<br /><br />
borne by MTJA. MTJA shall be entitled to receive the benefits therefrom<br /><br />
including the whole benefits of any production arising under (a). If<br /><br />
Contractors are unwilling to undertake such specified work MTJA or any<br /><br />
third party duly appointed by MTJA shall have the right to carry out<br /><br />
such specified work provided that no undue interference with Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations of Contractors shall be caused by reason thereof.<br /><br />
3.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The amount to be expended by Contractors in carrying out its exploration<br /><br />
activities in the Contract Area shall in the aggregate be not less than<br /><br />
twenty-five million United States Dollars (US$ 25,000,000).<br /><br />
If at the end of the fifth year from the Effective Date or by the date<br /><br />

No borehole or well shall be abandoned and no cemented string or other<br /><br />
permanent form of casing shall be withdrawn from any borehole or well<br /><br />
which is proposed to be abandoned without the prior written consent of<br /><br />
MTJA. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in respect of boreholes<br /><br />
or wells which have become or are unproductive and in such cases shall<br /><br />
be given promptly with due regard to the cost of any delay. MTJA may in<br /><br />
any case require that no borehole or well shall be plugged or any works<br /><br />
be executed for that purpose save in the presence of its officials,<br /><br />
provided such requirement does not unduly delay the agreed operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

there shall next be ascertained the price actually realised or<br /><br />
the equivalent monetary value of other consideration actually<br /><br />
received in the case of the portion of Crude Oil produced from<br /><br />
the Contract Area in the relevant Quarter which is:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
sold otherwise than on and's length terms;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
transferred to a refinery, processed or otherwise<br /><br />
disposed of other than by way of sale;<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
where the price or value of consideration received pursuant to<br /><br />
any transaction as described in paragraph (b) above is less than<br /><br />
the quarterly weighted average price of transactions falling<br /><br />
within paragraph (a) above, then in respect of any such<br /><br />
transaction, such quarterly weighted average price shall<br /><br />
substitute for the price actually realised or value of other<br /><br />
consideration received, for the purpose of this Article;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
where in any Quarter there are no transactions within paragraph<br /><br />
(a) above, for the purpose of applying paragraph (c) above,<br /><br />
references to the quarterly weighted price of transactions<br /><br />
falling within paragraph (a) shall be substituted by references<br /><br />
to the average f.o.b. price at which other Malaysian and/or Thai<br /><br />
Crude Oil has been sold on arm's length terms to buyers in the<br /><br />
export markets to which Malaysian and/or Thai Crude Oil is<br /><br />
commonly sold in the relevant Quarter, taking due account of any<br /><br />
differences in quality and cost of transport;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the value of Crude Oil for each Quarter shall be the weighted<br /><br />
average of the prices realised (or value received) in respect of<br /><br />
all transactions referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of<br /><br />
Article 7.1 for that Quarter (or, as the case may be, deemed to<br /><br />
have been paid or received in accordance with paragraphs (c) and<br /><br />
(d) of Article 7.1).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that it becomes necessary to calculate a price for Crude<br /><br />
Oil in accordance with Article 7.1(d), MTJA shall notify Contractors the<br /><br />
price which is, in its opinion, the price for the relevant Quarter in<br /><br />
accordance with the provisions thereof. Unless Contractors give notice<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-49to MTJA within fourteen (14) days of such notification that they do not<br /><br />
agree to such price, such price shall be deemed to be the price<br /><br />
calculated in accordance with Article 7.1(d). If Contractors notify MTJA<br /><br />
that they do not accept the price notified by MTJA, Contractors and MTJA<br /><br />
shall reach agreement between them on the proper price in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 7.1(d) and until such agreement is reached, the price used<br /><br />
shall be the average of the price proposed by MTJA and the price<br /><br />
proposed by Contractors.<br /><br />
7.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the application of Article 7.1, the price of Crude Oil shall be<br /><br />
calculated before deduction of any export duty and other taxes,<br /><br />
commissions, brokerage, or discounts and with due allowances for any<br /><br />
differences in credit terms.<br /><br />

NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
8.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where Non-associated Gas is discovered and such discovery is, in the<br /><br />
reasonable opinion of Contractors, substantial, Contractors and MTJA<br /><br />
shall, by agreement between them, define the extent of the Gas Field<br /><br />
from which such discovery was made plus a reserve area sufficient to<br /><br />
cover the probable and possible areal extent of the Gas Field (as<br /><br />
defined by the extent of structural closure based upon existing<br /><br />
engineering, geophysical, and geological data); and Contractors, upon<br /><br />
making written application within forty-five (45) days of such<br /><br />
discovery, shall, subject to agreement on the extent of such Gas Field<br /><br />
and its reserve area, be allowed to hold the Gas Field plus such reserve<br /><br />
area for a period not exceeding five (5) years commencing on the fifth<br /><br />
anniversary of the Effective Date. The purpose of this holding period is<br /><br />
for Contractors to submit for the approval of MTJA a comprehensive<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Development Plan for the implementation of a viable gas supply project<br /><br />
based on normally acceptable commercial considerations. The Development<br /><br />
Plan for the Gas Field or Fields, notwithstanding the provisions of<br /><br />
Article 1, shall also include a realistic gas demand forecast<br /><br />
corresponding to specific outlets, sequence and timing of field<br /><br />
development, the proposed project structure, gas pricing mechanism and<br /><br />
other fiscal terms for the project.<br /><br />
Contractors shall before the expiry of the 5-year holding period submit<br /><br />
a Development Plan for the Gas Field or Fields for the approval of MTJA.<br /><br />
Failure to submit a Development Plan within the 5-year holding period<br /><br />
shall render the Gas Field or Fields relinquished to MTJA.<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-51Contractors shall develop the Gas Field or Fields within five (5) years<br /><br />
from the date of MTJA's approval of the Development Plan or within any<br /><br />
longer period as MTJA may approve.<br /><br />
Failure to develop the Gas Field or Fields within the approved period<br /><br />
shall render the Gas Field or Fields relinquished to MTJA unless<br /><br />
Contractors can reasonably demonstrate that such failure is due to force<br /><br />
majeure circumstances pursuant to Article 22.<br /><br />
In the event that Contractors, after full investigation during a holding<br /><br />
period of a Gas Field or Fields, consider that the development,<br /><br />
production and delivery of Natural Gas to any outlet cannot be justified<br /><br />
commercially, the relevant Gas Field or Fields shall be relinquished and<br /><br />
no longer form part of the Contract Area and MTJA may thereafter<br /><br />
undertake at its own expense the development of the Gas Field or Fields<br /><br />
and the production arising therefrom shall, notwithstanding any other<br /><br />
provisions of this Contract, accrue wholly to MTJA.<br /><br />
Upon relinquishment of any Gas Field under any provision of this<br /><br />
Contract, MTJA and its authorised representatives shall have the<br /><br />
absolute right to move freely within the Contract Area for doing all<br /><br />
that are necessary for the purpose of evaluation, developing and<br /><br />
producing Natural Gas from any Gas Field so relinquished to MTJA<br /><br />
provided that no undue interference with Petroleum Operations of<br /><br />
Contractors shall be caused by reason thereof.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the above, any Gas Field not developed within the period<br /><br />
of this contract shall be considered relinquished to MTJA.<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-528.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article, Contractors shall<br /><br />
obtain MTJA's approval for using Non- associated Gas produced in the<br /><br />
Contract Area for all Petroleum Operations in Crude Oil production<br /><br />
including re-injection for pressure maintenance or re-cycling operations<br /><br />
to effect maximum economic recovery of Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The production of Non-associated Gas under this Contract may be carried<br /><br />
out:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for a period of twenty (20) years from the date of the First<br /><br />
Commercial Production; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
until the expiry of the term of this Contract,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
whichever is the earlier. Provided however in the event Contractors<br /><br />
effect the First Commercial Production before the expiry of the holding<br /><br />
period (for the identification and nomination of the gas market) or the<br /><br />
development period, the balance of either or both of those periods shall<br /><br />
be added to the above production period.<br /><br />
8.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors' entitlement to Associated Gas from any Oil Field shall be<br /><br />
governed by the duration as allowed for the production of Crude Oil<br /><br />
under Article 2.6 from the relevant Oil Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to MTJA's approval, Contractors shall be given priority to use<br /><br />
Associated Gas produced in the Contract Area for Petroleum Operations<br /><br />
including re-injection for pressure maintenance or re-cycling operations<br /><br />
to effect maximum economic recovery of Crude Oil and the cost of such<br /><br />
operations shall be regarded as an allowable cost for the calculation of<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-53Cost Oil in accordance with Article 5.1(b). Subject to the preceding<br /><br />
sentence, Contractors shall collect all Associated Gas that is produced<br /><br />
in association with Crude Oil and which is agreed with MTJA to be<br /><br />
capable of being exploited commercially by Contractors.<br /><br />
It is hereby recognised by the Parties that Contractors shall minimise<br /><br />
flaring of Associated Gas by re-injecting Associated Gas not needed in<br /><br />
the conduct of Petroleum Operations and Associated Gas not capable of<br /><br />
being exploited commercially into suitable strata or underground storage<br /><br />
in accordance with good oilfield practice. Contractors shall seek<br /><br />
MTJA's permission to flare Associated Gas which cannot be re-injected<br /><br />
due to specific reservoir considerations or for other reasons that are<br /><br />
accepted internationally and in line with good oilfield practice.<br /><br />
Before flaring, Contractors shall take all reasonable measures to ensure<br /><br />
the extraction of natural gasoline and other liquids contained in<br /><br />
Associated Gas if economically justifiable in the opinion of MTJA and<br /><br />
Contractors.<br /><br />
8.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of division of Natural Gas under this Contract, there<br /><br />
shall first be deducted from Natural Gas, be it Associated Gas or<br /><br />
Non-associated Gas or both produced and saved and not used in Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations but available for commercial sale in the Contract Area in a<br /><br />
Quarter:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ten per cent (10%) shall be taken by MTJA in kind to be disposed<br /><br />
in any manner it deems fit to settle royalty payments for that<br /><br />
Quarter to the respective Governments pursuant to the MTJA Act<br /><br />
1990;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-54(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
up to a maximum of fifty per cent (50%) shall be applied in the<br /><br />
manner hereinafter provided for the purpose of recovery by<br /><br />
Contractors of allowable costs expended in that Quarter for the<br /><br />
Contract Area in relation to Petroleum Operations in respect of<br /><br />
Natural Gas.<br /><br />
Contractors are entitled to recover all such allowable costs<br /><br />
from the proceeds of Natural Gas sold equal to the amount of all<br /><br />
such allowable costs in the Contract Area (but subject to<br /><br />
Article 8.7).<br /><br />
If in any Quarter all such costs expended relating to Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations in respect of Natural Gas (including amounts<br /><br />
accumulated or carried forward from previous Quarters) exceed<br /><br />
the value of fifty per cent (50%) of such Natural Gas sold from<br /><br />
the Contract Area, the unrecovered excess may be carried forward<br /><br />
to the next succeeding Quarter and added to all such allowable<br /><br />
costs expended relating to Petroleum Operations in respect of<br /><br />
Natural Gas for that Quarter, but provided that such costs can<br /><br />
only be recovered for any Quarter up to a maximum of fifty per<br /><br />
cent (50%) of such Natural Gas sold.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The remaining proceeds from the Natural Gas sold shall be divided in<br /><br />
the manner provided in Article 8.6.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the definition of Crude Oil in Article 1.1, costs<br /><br />
associated with the production of condensates and Natural Gas liquids<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall be considered as part of all such costs expended relating to<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in respect of Natural Gas, and shall be recoverable<br /><br />
as provided above in this Article and/or Article 5.1(e).<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-558.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The total Profit Gas proceeds in a Quarter shall be divided between MTJA<br /><br />
and Contractors such that MTJA and Contractors shall take and receive<br /><br />
their respective entitlements in the ratio of fifty to fifty (50:50).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors and MTJA shall negotiate for the sale of Natural Gas on a<br /><br />
joint-dedicated basis to an outlet or outlets for Natural Gas at prices<br /><br />
and upon terms common to both Parties which in the opinion of MTJA and<br /><br />
Contractors justify the development, production and delivery of Natural<br /><br />
Gas to such outlet having regard to Article 3.7 and a competitive price.<br /><br />
Contractors are not authorised to sell their share of Natural Gas<br /><br />
pursuant to Articles 8.5(b) and 8.6 on any other basis save on a<br /><br />
joint-dedicated basis. However, Contractors and MTJA may each take<br /><br />
necessary steps to identify a Natural Gas outlet or outlets at the<br /><br />
earliest opportunities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to Contractors agreeing to develop, produce and deliver Natural<br /><br />
Gas to an outlet or outlets referred to in Article 8.7 and subject<br /><br />
further to MTJA participating in the development of the said outlet or<br /><br />
outlets, MTJA may, by notice to Contractors and subject to such terms as<br /><br />
it may determine, invite Contractors to participate in the development<br /><br />
of the said outlet or outlets. Within three (3) months of receipt of<br /><br />
such notice Contractors shall notify MTJA in writing whether or not they<br /><br />
agree to participate in the development of the said outlet or outlets.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractors shall be responsible for all losses of Natural Gas produced<br /><br />
up to the relevant outlet as determined pursuant to this Article 8, by<br /><br />
reason of Contractors' proven negligence or wilful misconduct, and<br /><br />
without prejudice to MTJA's other rights and remedies MTJA may give<br /><br />
notice to Contractors that such loss shall be applied first in reducing<br /><br />
Contractors' Portion of Profit Gas. Any loss occasioned by any cause<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-56other than Contractors' proven negligence or wilful misconduct during<br /><br />
transfer of such Natural Gas to such outlet shall be shared between MTJA<br /><br />
and Contractors in proportion to their respective aggregate entitlements<br /><br />
to Cost Gas and Profit Gas pursuant to Articles 8.5 (b) and 8.6.<br /><br />

guarantee shall serve to guarantee the performance of the minimum<br /><br />
expenditure obligations specified in Article 3.5 by each of the<br /><br />
Contractor parties. In the event of an assignment of interest in this<br /><br />
Contract to a third party, the parent company of the assignee shall<br /><br />
provide a letter of guarantee, as being one of the conditions for MTJA<br /><br />
to approve such assignment, in the same form as that set forth in<br /><br />

TAXES AND DUTIES<br /><br />
21.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to Articles 21.2 and 21.3, Contractors shall pay at their own<br /><br />
expense all taxes, duties, charges and levies imposed by the respective<br /><br />
Governments for which Contractors are liable under the laws of Malaysia<br /><br />
and the Kingdom of Thailand, as the case may be.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The terms of the Contract have been negotiated and agreed having due<br /><br />
regard to the terms of Articles 16 and 17 of the MTJA Agreement. Where<br /><br />
the taxes and duties referred to in Article 21.1 relate to petroleum<br /><br />
income tax, custom matters and export duty, such tax or duty, as the<br /><br />
case may be, shall be in accordance with the MTJA Agreement and shall be<br /><br />
imposed in compliance with the relevant legislation of Malaysia and the<br /><br />
Kingdom of Thailand, duly amended or adopted in its application to<br /><br />
Contractors hereunder to comply with the MTJA Agreement as at the<br /><br />
Effective Date.<br /><br />

aforesaid or the implementation of any legislation, regulation or order<br /><br />
which imposes taxes, duties or levies inconsistent with Articles 16 and<br /><br />
17 of the MTJA Agreement, and such effect will be to increase or<br /><br />
decrease Contractors' liabilities, MTJA and Contractors shall meet and<br /><br />
formulate a mutually acceptable arrangement to restore the Contractors<br /><br />
to the same fiscal status under the terms of Articles 16 and 17 of the<br /><br />

FORCE MAJEURE<br /><br />
22.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where the occurrence of force majeure beyond the reasonable control of<br /><br />
MTJA or Contractors renders it impossible or hinders or delays the<br /><br />
performance of any obligation (other than an obligation to make a<br /><br />
payment) or the exercise of any right under this Contract then the<br /><br />
failure or omission of MTJA or Contractors to perform such an obligation<br /><br />
shall not be treated as a failure or omission to comply with this<br /><br />
Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where MTJA or Contractors fail or omit to perform any obligation<br /><br />
hereunder in obedience to any Government act, order or regulation,<br /><br />
provided it is proved that such failure or omission is the necessary<br /><br />
consequence of such act, order or regulation, such failure or omission<br /><br />
shall not be treated as a failure or omission to comply with this<br /><br />
Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon the occurrence of any force majeure the Party so affected in the<br /><br />
discharge of its obligations shall promptly:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
give written notice of such event to the other; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
resume full performance of this Contract as soon as possible,<br /><br />
and to that end that Party shall use its best endeavours to<br /><br />
remove or remedy the cause of such prevention as quickly as may<br /><br />
be practicable, provided that if such occurrence results in the<br /><br />
suspension of all or a major part of Petroleum Operations<br /><br />
previously planned, and if such suspension continues for more<br /><br />
than three (3) months, the Parties shall meet and determine<br /><br />
whether it is equitable that the duration of this Contract and<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
-86appropriate period thereof, should be extended by a period equal<br /><br />
to the period of the suspension. If the suspension arising out<br /><br />
of a force majeure situation involves a total suspension of all<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations previously planned, and such suspension<br /><br />
continues for more than twelve (12) months, the Parties shall<br /><br />
consult each other in order to come to an agreement on the<br /><br />
resumption of Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
