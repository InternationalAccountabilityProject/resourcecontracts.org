The proposed initial project is exploration period. The general                       <br /><br /><br />
objectives of the this project is to determine the potential for Chromite             <br /><br /><br />
and Nickel mineralization concealed under a shallow cover lateritic soil,             <br /><br /><br />
and the residual and alluvial chromite deposits and limonite and                      <br /><br /><br />
sapprtolitic deposits of the project area will be to be used as basis for             <br /><br /><br />
the determination of the viability of developing and exploiting the                   <br /><br /><br />
mineral(s) to be found therein using socially accepted procedures but                 <br /><br /><br />
least negative impact on the environment.                                             <br /><br /><br />

Since Surigao Mineral Reservation is notable of its high                              <br /><br /><br />
potential for Chromite and Nickel mineralization and due to the increase              <br /><br /><br />
of demands for chromite and nickel ores, the primary minerals to be                   <br /><br /><br />
explored are chromite and nickel. However, other valuable minerals to                 <br /><br /><br />
be found therein, will also be given attention once it is found to be                 <br /><br /><br />
mineable.                                                                             <br /><br /><br />

           The climate of Surigao del Norte and offshore islands, including            <br /><br /><br />
           Dinagat Island, lie in the tropical belt influenced by an equatorial        <br /><br /><br />
           weather regime with mild temperature variation and frequent rainfalls.      <br /><br /><br />
           The applied area lies on the southern edge of the typhoon belt and          <br /><br /><br />
           receives both northeast and southwest monsoons, locally know as             <br /><br /><br />
           “Amihan” and “Habagat”, respectively.                                       <br /><br /><br />
           There is no marked distinction between the wet and the rainy                <br /><br /><br />
           seasons since rains also occur during the dry seasons and vice versa.       <br /><br /><br />
           Generally, the wet months occur from October to March with                  <br /><br /><br />
           December and January having the greatest precipitation (55 to 68 cm)        <br /><br /><br />
           while dry months occur from April to September having moderate              <br /><br /><br />
           precipitation (10 to 22 cm) with May and June are relatively dry,           <br /><br /><br />
           although periods of more than a few days without measurable rainfall        <br /><br /><br />
           are rare. The mean monthly precipitation ranges from 10 to 68 cm and        <br /><br /><br />
           the annual precipitation averages 372 cm.                                   <br /><br /><br />
           Temperature are remarkably constant, with the mean monthly                  <br /><br /><br />
           temperature ranging from 25° to 27.6° C. The average annual                 <br /><br /><br />
           temperature for the last ten years period was about 27°C. Records of        <br /><br /><br />
           the Provincial Weather Station of Surigao seldom show temperatures          <br /><br /><br />
           higher than 35°C or lower than 18°C. The mean relative humidity in the      <br /><br /><br />
           region ranges from 82% to 99%.                                              <br /><br /><br />
           Although winds of high velocity are infrequent in Dinagat Island            <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
           and Surigao Del Norte in General, are affected by strong winds, mainly      <br /><br /><br />
           during southwest monsoon period. Three tropical cyclones passed             <br /><br /><br />
           through the province within the last ten years. The waters in the           <br /><br /><br />
           western embayments of Dinagat Island are quiet during the severest          <br /><br /><br />
           storms but very rough in the open sea and Surigao Channel. During           <br /><br /><br />
           severe storms the Surigao Channel may not be navigable by launches,         <br /><br /><br />
           resulting in the isolation of the island. This may happen once or twice a   <br /><br /><br />
           year and may last up to eight days. In the local Visayan language, this     <br /><br /><br />
           phenomenon is known as “Walo-Walo” (from Walo meaning eight).               <br /><br /><br />

                In the regional context Dinagat and its islands are located in the           <br /><br /><br />
                central part of the Eastern Bicol-East Mindanao ophiolite belt and           <br /><br /><br />
                apparently represent the northwestern projection of Eastern Mindanao         <br /><br /><br />
                Ridge. With more that ninety percent of its area underlain by ophiolitic     <br /><br /><br />
                suite rocks the Dinagat group of islands constitutes the lowermost           <br /><br /><br />
                section of the eastern Mindanao Tectonic block and form part of a NW-        <br /><br /><br />
                SE trending horst extending from Bucas Grande Island and Carrascal           <br /><br /><br />
                area of Surigao mainland on the south, to HIbuson Island on the north        <br /><br /><br />
                (see geological map attached) . The Dinagat ophiolite has a K-Ar age         <br /><br /><br />
                of 84 nxy. corresponding to the Upper Cretaceous period. It is               <br /><br /><br />
                dominated by ultramafic plutonic rocks with small amounts of pillow          <br /><br /><br />
                basalts and sheeted diabase complex and only minor gabbro and                <br /><br /><br />
                pyroxenite. The bulk of ultramafites is made of Harzburgite Tectonic         <br /><br /><br />
                grading upward through a layered Transition Zone into cumulate dunite        <br /><br /><br />
                masses. This Transition Zone consist of dunite and harzburgite               <br /><br /><br />
                interlayers and is the major host of economic chromite mineralization        <br /><br /><br />
                The boundary between the Transition Zone and the Dunite can be easily        <br /><br /><br />
                recognized but the boundary between this Transition Zone and the             <br /><br /><br />
                Harzburgite Tectonic is hardly delineated.                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
                Mafic cumulate members of the ophiolite are noticeably absent,               <br /><br /><br />
                except of small, local interlayers of pyroxenite, particularly within the    <br /><br /><br />
                Transition Zone and dunite masses. A small body of isotropic gabbro          <br /><br /><br />
                cuts the serpentinized dunite mass in the northern part of the island. A     <br /><br /><br />
                second small body of similar gabbro is associated with the diabase dyke      <br /><br /><br />
                swarms in Malinao valley. The sheeted diabase complex and spilitic           <br /><br /><br />
                pillow lavas occur as underthrusted sheets below the ultramafites,           <br /><br /><br />
                forming two prominent tectonic windows in the Loreto-Malinao and             <br /><br /><br />
                Albor-San Jose River valley, respectively. The relationship between          <br /><br /><br />
                these two principal ophiolite components, as well as the absence of          <br /><br /><br />
                mafic cumulates suggest an imbricated sequence of slabs for the              <br /><br /><br />

                   Unlike Surigao Mainland, on Dinagat Island there is a                       <br /><br /><br />

                   Dinagat ophiolite and the crystalline rocks of Nueva Estrella Schist are    <br /><br /><br />
                   the Loreto Clastics (Lower Miocene), consisting of polymictic               <br /><br /><br />
                   conglomerates and fine clastics, with lithic fragments of various           <br /><br /><br />
                   ophiolite lithologies. A thickly-bedded reef limestone (Mid. Miocene-       <br /><br /><br />
                   Lower Pliocene), probably equivalent to Siargao Formation (J1CA-            <br /><br /><br />
                   MMAJ, 1990) overlies comformably the Loreto Clastics and marks the          <br /><br /><br />
                   end of Tertiary deposition. These post ophiolite sediments fringe in        <br /><br /><br />
                   places Dinagat Island along its western coast. Their overall distribution   <br /><br /><br />
                   and dips point to deposition in shallow basin or irregular depressions in   <br /><br /><br />
                   the ophiolite mass, marginal to a NNW-SSE trending principal basin,         <br /><br /><br />
                   now submerged in the Surigao Staits.                                        <br /><br /><br />

                   uplift of the ophiolite ground and prevailing erosional condions during     <br /><br /><br />

                   the emplacement of the ophiolites and deposition of the presently           <br /><br /><br />
                   known Tertiary rocks cannot be determined. Loreto Clastics directly         <br /><br /><br />

                   worn pebbles and cobbles suggesting the reworking of some older             <br /><br /><br />
                   conglomerates, also of serpentinite derivation. The discovery of            <br /><br /><br />
                   reworked Eocene forams and Eocene limestone boulders in these               <br /><br /><br />
                   conglomerates, on Nonoc Island (southernmost island of Dinagat)             <br /><br /><br />
                   suggests deposition of Eocene sediments in the area but later removed       <br /><br /><br />
                   by erosion (Wright et. al., 1958). Similarly the epithermal gold            <br /><br /><br />

                   may be associated with eroded andesitiec volcanics equivalent to those      <br /><br /><br />
                   of Surigao mainland.                                                        <br /><br /><br />

                   developed over ultramafic rocks during a period of prolonged and            <br /><br /><br />
                   widespread chemical weathering, probably active since Pleistocene.          <br /><br /><br />
                   Several of these laterites constitute secondary nickel and chromite         <br /><br /><br />
                   deposits. The confinement of most these deposits to relatively lower        <br /><br /><br />
                   ground suggests the present of distinct erosional levels not recognized     <br /><br /><br />
                   by the present study. Alluvial and beach deposits are mostly confined       <br /><br /><br />
                   to the principal river valleys and western embayments of the island,        <br /><br /><br />
                   respectively. The morphology of the western coast of Dinagat and            <br /><br /><br />
                   associations of raised beach deposit may considered as indicative of a      <br /><br /><br />
                   relative slower submergence of this side of the island.                     <br /><br /><br />

 present problem in siltation will be solved by constructing series                          <br /><br /><br />
