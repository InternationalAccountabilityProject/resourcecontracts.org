(i) the formation is encountered at a lesser depth than originally anticipated;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii) basement is encountered at a lesser depth than originally anticipated;<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
(iv) insurmountable technical problems are encountered rendering it impractical to continue drilling with standard equipment; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v) petroleum formations are encountered whose penetration requires laying protective casing that does not enable the depth agreed by the Management Committee to be reached.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If drilling is stopped for any of the foregoing reasons, the Exploration Well shall be deemed to have been drilled to the depth agreed by the Management Committee and the CONTRACTOR shall be deemed to have satisfied its Minimum Exploration Obligations in respect of the Exploration Well.<br /><br />

(d) Any geological or geophysical work carried out or any seismic data acquired, processed or interpreted or any Exploration Well drilled or any other work performed in excess of the Minimum Exploration Obligations and/or any amounts spent in excess of the total Minimum Financial Commitment in any<br /><br />
<br /><br />
32/116 [signature]    given Sub-Period, shall be carried forward to the    <br /><br />
    next Sub-Period or any extension period and shall be <br /><br />

    Financial Commitment for such subsequent Sub-Period <br /><br />
    or extension period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e) For the avoidance of doubt, if: (i) in the First <br /><br />
    Sub-Period, the CONTRACTOR performs any of the <br /><br />

    (in accordance with and subject to Article 6.4). the <br /><br />
    performance of such Minimum Exploration Obligations <br /><br />
    shall be deemed to satisfy the same Minimum <br /><br />
    Exploration Obligations for the Second Sub-Period.<br /><br />
