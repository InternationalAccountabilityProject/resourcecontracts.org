Executive Summary<br /><br />
Project Background<br /><br />
Sierra Minerals Holdings Ltd. (SMHL) is a joint venture known as VIMETCO Group that owns license to<br /><br />
mine bauxite in the south eastern Province of Sierra Leone. The lease area is located in five chiefdoms<br /><br />
within Bo, Moyamba and Bonthe Districts.<br /><br />
For SMHL to continue with its operations in the Concession area, the Environment Protection Agency<br /><br />
(EPA/SL) is requesting for an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) before a License can be<br /><br />
renewed. The ESIA should outline the existing environmental and social conditions within the mine site<br /><br />
and the surrounding communities identify potential impacts of the project and propose mitigation<br /><br />
measures that SMHL should undertake during its project operations.<br /><br />
Tropical Environmental Design Associates (TEDA) was retained by SMHL to prepare this ESIA with the<br /><br />
following Terms of Reference (TOR).<br /><br />
1. Describe and assess the prevailing baseline environmental and socio-economic conditions of the<br /><br />
study area.<br /><br />
2. Produce project overview including: management, Infrastructure and methods of production.<br /><br />
3. Describe the national and international regulatory framework applicable to bauxite mining in<br /><br />
Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Determine project alternative scenarios.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5. Identify, predict and determine the intensity of the impacts on the receptors using the<br /><br />
information obtained from objective 1.<br /><br />
6. Propose mitigation measures that would be used to minimize these impacts.<br /><br />
7. Produce a summary of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) based on the information<br /><br />
obtained and that contained in the EMP and,<br /><br />
8. Conduct a Public Consultation and Disclosure meetings with all stakeholders including the<br /><br />
affected communities at chiefdom, district and regional levels. These will be held to solicit<br /><br />
feedback from all stakeholders’ concerns, and if possible propose further mitigation measures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Brief Description of the Project<br /><br />
SMHL produces about 1.4 million metric tonnes of bauxite annually from five main deposits at Gbonge,<br /><br />
Gondama, Jenega, Konta, and Wunde. It has a complex washing facility at Gondama with a capacity of<br /><br />
300t/hr. and a recovery of more than 65 percent. The bauxite mined is shipped to Constanta in Romania<br /><br />
for ALUM Tulcea the primary alumina manufacturing company that produces 600,000 tpa.<br /><br />
The proven washed bauxite reserves in the SML lease area are 12.5 million metric tonnes with an overall<br /><br />
grade of 51% Al203, 48% available alumina (av. Al2O3) and 3.0 % Si02 but total reserves should be at least<br /><br />
30 million metric tonnes. This reserve estimate will support production for approximately 20 years at an<br /><br />
annual production rate of 1.7 million metric tonnes. The bauxite reserves are dispersed 20% around the<br /><br />
washing plant and 80%, 14-18 km haulage distance from the washing plant.<br /><br />
The exploration program involves line cutting, pitting, drilling, sampling and assaying. The entire lease<br /><br />
area was prospected and classified by an earlier company, Sieromco into measured, indicated or<br /><br />
inferred resources. Based on this available information, SMHL has primarily been engaged in validating<br /><br />
these reported resources in four deposits (Konta, Wunde, Jenega and Gbonge) by generating its current<br /><br />
reserve base and the extension of SMHL mine life.<br /><br />
Infrastructure and Machinery<br /><br />
Summarily, the existing facilities and owner assets include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Senior staff Camp – 14 double houses and lodging facilities with 7 rooms.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Two administrative buildings, 2 canteens, mechanical workshop area, laboratory, store,<br /><br />
warehouse and a fuel station at the main plant site at Gondama.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Harbour facility with dryer, 9 barges, 4 tug boats, fuel storage tanks and conveyors at Nitti.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Five power Generating plants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tailing storage facilities,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Stockpile facilities (ROM & Washed).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A fleet of vehicles including 30 MAN trucks and 32 Volvo trucks.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A fleet of mining machinery including<br /><br />
<br /><br />
excavators, dozers, frontal loader, graders,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
compactors and a wide range of support equipments.etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Project Access (Land and Sea).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Water resources within/proximity to SMHL lease are abundant. Due to the large quantities of water<br /><br />
required by bauxite wash process, water is sourced at the Taia River and pumped to a 5000 m 3 capacity<br /><br />
reservoir which in turn runs to the plant site by gravity flow.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SMHL has a highly skilled and experienced workforce with an organizational management capable of<br /><br />
running the project at management and supervisory level. More than 95% of the workforce is Sierra<br /><br />
Leonean and majority of the employees are skilled with technical expertise in handling mining related<br /><br />
jobs.<br /><br />
Regulatory Framework<br /><br />
In accordance with the national and international regulatory framework for mining and due diligence<br /><br />
requirements of the lending institutions, the submission and acceptance of this ESIA is a mandatory<br /><br />
precursor for the renewal of license for this project. These regulatory framework and policies were used<br /><br />
in the preparation of this report.<br /><br />
Baseline Conditions<br /><br />
The baseline data used in the preparation of this report was based on field visits carried out between<br /><br />
September and November 2012. They complemented those previously collected from other sources.<br /><br />
Stakeholder consultations were undertaken to determine the additional data required for the evaluation<br /><br />
of the baseline conditions and potential impacts of the project. Following the stakeholder consultations,<br /><br />
a field survey was undertaken with the purpose of obtaining an overview of the entire study area that<br /><br />
would further complement the information gathered during the consultative meetings.<br /><br />
Environmental baseline conditions studied include: topography, climate, drainage, geology, water<br /><br />
resources, flora, fauna, and socio-economic data including demography, health and sanitation,<br /><br />
education, water supply, agricultural practices and land tenure.<br /><br />
Project Impacts and Mitigation<br /><br />
Project Benefits<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The exploitation of mineral resources such as bauxite is benefitting SMHL and its allied companies<br /><br />
financially. Apart from this direct benefit to the company, an array of other direct and indirect benefits<br /><br />
that the project could have on the mining community and the country at large are as follows:<br /><br />
Economic Benefits: In 2010 SMHL Vimetco acquired the bauxite mines from Titanium Resources Group<br /><br />
(TRG) with a market capital of $189 million. The injection of capital expenditure in foreign exchange has<br /><br />
boosted the economy of Sierra Leone in terms of foreign exchange earnings. The project is also<br /><br />
generating economic benefits to the GOSL in terms of taxes, duties and royalties as specified in the<br /><br />
mining code.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Job Creation: The project directly and indirectly is injecting money into the local economy through<br /><br />
salaries to workers and supplies outsourced locally which thereby increases the purchasing power of the<br /><br />
local population. This is indirectly benefitting the small business groups in the community and the local<br /><br />
tax collection system.<br /><br />
Roads Infrastructure: Since operations started, SMHL has reconstructed and resurfaced all roads in the<br /><br />
lease area and it has continued to invest in maintenance of local roads with other neighboring<br /><br />
companies in the project area. This is facilitating a speedy movement of goods, agricultural produce and<br /><br />
people within and outside the concession area.<br /><br />
Community Development Initiatives: Since November 2012, the company has been financing community<br /><br />
development initiatives within the purview of SMHL Foundation in the five chiefdoms and in the<br /><br />
following priority areas of interventions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Continued rehabilitation of major roads and haul roads in the concession area and Joint venture<br /><br />
rehabilitation of other major roads in the Moyamba District;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of Maternity and Child Health Post, hand dug wells fitted with pumps and classroom buildings.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provision of building materials to households affected by fire accidents in the community;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provision of services and supplies to the Serabu Hospital and Mokanji Police Station; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Offer of scholarships and tuition to students resident in the mining community.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the above positive impacts, SMHL operations continue to have various negative<br /><br />
biophysical and socio-economic impacts in its operations. These were predicted using established<br /><br />
procedures, standards and by means of professional and subjective judgments. Most of these impacts<br /><br />
were rated from insignificant to moderate. With no mitigation measures applied, most of these are<br /><br />
either minor or moderate. The table below presents a summary of the projects’ impacts and mitigation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When all the impacts are considered the two most prominent are those that are prevalent on surface<br /><br />
water, including the hydrology and natural drainage systems in the natural environment and the<br /><br />
disconnect existing between the communities expectations and apprehensions and the realistic gains<br /><br />
which may accrue through a more equitable transfer mechanism. Although there will be a number of<br /><br />
social impacts of high significance, the majority of the impacts on social conditions are of moderate<br /><br />
<br /><br />
significance. These social impacts must be compared with the predicted benefits of the mining activities,<br /><br />
as indicated in Section 1. The positive economic impact of the mines is highly significant, and the<br /><br />
revenue from taxation that will accrue to government provides resources that can be used to<br /><br />
significantly improve the condition of infrastructure in the South east region of the country. The<br /><br />
economic benefit to the local economy is also significant, since the project will not only support several<br /><br />
hundred employees directly, but it will also support significantly more of their dependents. It is<br /><br />
estimated that, on average, each employee will support eight dependents or family members. This<br /><br />
should result in a general improvement in standards of living in the study area and provides an<br /><br />
alternative livelihood to the current subsistence farming.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Analyses of Alternatives<br /><br />
Analyses of alternatives constitute part of this ESIA. The purpose is to improve on project design,<br /><br />
construction and operation decision making based on feasible project alternatives as prescribed by the<br /><br />
International Finance Corporation (IFC, 2006). It provides the basis for identifying optimal project<br /><br />
alternatives that are consistent with the goals of the mining company, funding organization, the<br /><br />
government, the mining community and the policy and regulatory framework established for the mining<br /><br />
industry.<br /><br />
Project alternatives that were considered for SMHL project include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Action alternative;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Alternative for location of staff accommodation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Bauxite processing location;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mine closure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The adoption of the no-action alternative would mean that the project would remain in its current<br /><br />
condition with no mine-related development activity by SMHL. This scenario would mean that the<br /><br />
Environmental Management Plan and the community Development Action Plan (CDAP) that are<br /><br />
prepared would not be implemented. As such, the anticipated project benefits such as employment,<br /><br />
foreign exchange earnings, infrastructure development and community development initiatives would<br /><br />
not improve in the concession area and the country as a whole. This will result in the continuation of in<br /><br />
migration into the area and the resultant poor state of local economy, infrastructure and other public<br /><br />
services.<br /><br />
Following the depletion of the Mokanji deposits in 1982, Sieromco relocated its operations to Gondama.<br /><br />
The accommodation provided for SMHL staff are located 20 – 40 miles away from the plant site. The<br /><br />
mining activities at the Gondama site do not require total off-site accommodation especially for<br /><br />
supervision work during the second and third shifts. The option therefore is the relocation or expansion<br /><br />
of staff accommodation closer to the mine site. Proximity to the mine site would lead to the following<br /><br />
benefits:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Reduction in travel time to work;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Increased work supervision at all times;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Proximity to the only Medical Hospital in the mining area;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decrease in the running cost of vehicles;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Extension of overtime work for certain staff categories;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Increase in the opportunity for the expansion of the Gbonge deposits and future expansion of<br /><br />
shipping facility closer to the four bauxite deposits at Mattru.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The existing processing plant is in a closer proximity to the five major deposits. For operational<br /><br />
considerations, the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) is located as close as possible to the plant site to<br /><br />
reduce cost of transportation of the slurry. The potential for the existing facility to near its storage<br /><br />
capacity is high considering mine life of SMHL operations. Consideration should be given for an<br /><br />
alternative storage facility in the near future.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tailings Disposal and Storage will involve a construction of mine pits in the Gbonge area into tailings<br /><br />
storage containment. The slurries would be deposited in the pits as mining continues. Filling would<br /><br />
continue for less than a year and after a decanting period, revegetation would start followed by a full<br /><br />
reclamation work based on the mine reclamation plan.<br /><br />
The major disadvantages of this alternative would be related to short term mine plan as this operation<br /><br />
will concurrently go on with other mining operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of a new storage facility would require concurrent construction work and mining<br /><br />
operations with little obstruction. Construction work would however be more expensive as materials<br /><br />
such as sand and gravel would have to be transported from a distance outside the mining area.<br /><br />
Preferred alternative for the two options would be controlled by key factors including costs, time of<br /><br />
construction, and availability of equipments, weather conditions and the expected life of the mine<br /><br />
operations.<br /><br />
Mine reclamation and closure activities at SMHL operations are implemented to establish a beneficial<br /><br />
post-mining land use, in the case of this project it will consist primarily of agricultural lands. This option<br /><br />
requires millions of dollars in earth moving activities, and it cannot be considered as the best option for<br /><br />
the open pits. The preferred options would be to identify those pits (especially those around Gbonge) to<br /><br />
fill with water in the wet season for use by the community at the end the mine life. Backfilling of these<br /><br />
pits with tailings slurries would be another feasible option considering the life of the existing tailings<br /><br />
facilities at the plant site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Public Consultation and Disclosure<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This section defines the Sierra Leone requirements for conducting stakeholder consultation and<br /><br />
disclosure activities during the ESIA process.<br /><br />
Public Consultation and disclosure meetings for this ESIA were held in respect of the renewal of license<br /><br />
at chiefdom, district and regional levels between January 25th and 28th 2013.<br /><br />
1. Serabu on the 25th January 2013 – Chiefdom level<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. Moyamba District on the 26th January 2013 – District level<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. Bo Town on the 28th January 2013 – Regional level<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The meetings were meant to allow all stakeholders stay informed on the current updates on SMHL<br /><br />
operations, allow all stakeholders voice their opinions, grievances and provide meaningful suggestions<br /><br />
for sustained operations of the project.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The key objectives of the public consultation and disclosure as set-out by the Sierra Leone<br /><br />
Environmental Protection Agency (SLEPA) as part of the international requirement for public hearings to<br /><br />
be undertaken for the approval/renewal and issuance of an Environmental Licence are;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Inform stakeholders (individuals, communities, local interest groups, Government officers, local<br /><br />
NGOs, Community Based Organizations, affected and interested parties) of the important<br /><br />
aspects of the SMHL-Vimetco Bauxite Project;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provide an opportunity to consult with local communities, stakeholders, civil activists etc to<br /><br />
voice out their concerns and perceptions regarding the project;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Consult comprehensively as far as possible by disseminating information about the nature of the<br /><br />
project, identify, and discuss the public concerns( potential project’s impacts) about the project;<br /><br />

similar aspects on project implementation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Respond to all stakeholders as far as possible and address the concerns and issues that are<br /><br />
raised.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To ensure full participation and contribution of community and stakeholders, notification via the local<br /><br />
media, print media, letters, telephone calls and display of banners, indicating time, date and locations of<br /><br />
the public hearing were undertaken prior to the disclosure process.<br /><br />
The following are the summary of the findings, comments and input from key government officials,<br /><br />
participants and affected communities at the three levels where the consultations and disclosure<br /><br />
meetings were held. These inputs have played a definitive role in shaping the focus of the ESIA<br /><br />
document and the development of mitigation/amelioration measures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Community Development undertaken by the company.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental impacts of the project on communities (e.g.: Noise, Pollution of air and water<br /><br />
bodies)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Socio-Economic benefits to the community (e.g. Youth employment, skills training etc.)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Section 1.0 - Introduction<br /><br />
1.1 Background<br /><br />
Sierra Minerals Holdings Ltd. is a joint venture known as VIMETCO Group that owns license to mine<br /><br />
bauxite in the south eastern Province of Sierra Leone. The lease area is located in five chiefdoms within<br /><br />
BO, Moyamba and Bonthe Districts. A brief description of the company’s business overview is presented<br /><br />
below:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
About 1.4 million tonnes of bauxite is produced annually from five main deposits at Gbonge,<br /><br />
Gondama, Jenega, Konta, and Wunde.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It has a complex washing facility at Gondama with :<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A capacity of 300t/hr.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A recovery of > 65%<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A total content of Al203>53% and;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A low content of SiO2 <4%.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Its harbor facilities located at Nitti (40km. from Gondama) include: a bauxite dryer, push boats,<br /><br />
barges and a loading facility.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The bauxite mined is shipped to Constanta in Romania for ALUM Tulcea the primary alumina<br /><br />
manufacturing company that produces 600,000 tpa.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For SMHL to continue with its operations in the Concession area, the Environment Protection Agency<br /><br />
(EPA/SL) is requesting for an Environmental Impact Assessment (ESIA) before a License can be renewed.<br /><br />
The ESIA should outline the existing environmental and social conditions within the mine site and the<br /><br />
surrounding communities to identify potential impacts of the project and the proposed mitigation<br /><br />
measures that SMHL should undertake during its project operations.<br /><br />
1.2 Terms of Reference<br /><br />
This Environmental and Social Impact Assessment report has been prepared in accordance with the<br /><br />
stipulations of the EPA/SL and the following Terms of Reference (TOR) received from SMHL.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. To describe and assess the prevailing baseline environmental and socio-economic conditions<br /><br />
of the study area and secondary data collection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

2. Produce project overview including: management, Infrastructure and methods of<br /><br />
production.<br /><br />
3. Describe the national and international regulatory framework applicable to bauxite mining<br /><br />
in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Determine project alternative scenarios.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5. Identify, predict and determine the intensity of the impacts on the receptors using the<br /><br />
information obtained from objective 1.<br /><br />
6. Propose mitigation measures that would be used to minimize these impacts.<br /><br />
7. Produce a summary of an Environmental Management Plan based on the information<br /><br />
obtained and that contained in the EMP.<br /><br />
8. Conduct a Public Consultation and Disclosure meetings with all stakeholders including the<br /><br />
affected communities at chiefdom, district and regional levels. These will be held to solicit<br /><br />
feedback from all stakeholder’s concerns, and if possible further mitigation measures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tropical Environmental Design Associates, Architects, Engineers, Environmental Designers and<br /><br />
Development Consultants (TEDA) were retained by SMHL to prepare this ESIA.<br /><br />

Section Six presents a summary of the Environmental Management Plan proposing residual impacts with<br /><br />
the pertinent measures to be addressed during project operations.<br /><br />
Section Seven presents conclusions and recommendations for sustained bauxite operations in the lease<br /><br />
area.<br /><br />
1.4 Project Setting<br /><br />
The project setting is divided into two impact areas: a. Areas of direct social and environmental impacts<br /><br />
immediately and directly affected by the mining operation namely, mine panels, plant site, haul roads,<br /><br />
Nitti Port, Matta Camp and the affected communities within the lease area. b. Areas of project influence<br /><br />
where most of the environmental impacts are influenced by project activities either within or outside<br /><br />
the lease area. Examples of these are villages outside the lease area but linked to the haul roads and<br /><br />
portions of those chiefdoms that are out of the lease area.<br /><br />
The lease area is about 163 kilometers south east of Freetown with the plant site and shipping facilities<br /><br />
located at Gondama and Nitti respectively. The bauxite concession covers an area of 321.2 square<br /><br />
kilometers as delineated in Exploration License EXPL 2/2001. Its principal deposits are concentrated in<br /><br />
Gbonge, Gondama, Jenega, Konta and Wunde. The road leading to Mattru from Freetown which<br /><br />
constitutes part of the haul road passes through the lease area for about 59.5 km. There are many<br /><br />
villages that are affected by the mine activities, but those mostly affected currently include: Gbonge,<br /><br />
Gondama, Jenega, Konta and Wunde. SMHL owns a residential camp at Matta (out of the concession<br /><br />
area) where accommodation and recreation facilities are located 20 km from Gondama and Nitti<br /><br />
respectively. The entire camp is fenced and guarded. It consists of 14 duplex houses for senior staff, 1<br /><br />
building for kitchen and a recreational area, 1 gym building; other building/utility/services that house<br /><br />
the generator and, laundry.<br /><br />
The entire project area is traversed by unpaved roads with the major ones leading to the five chiefdom<br /><br />
head quarter towns of Gbonge, Bumpeh, Gbangbatoke Banta Mokele and Mano Dase. A number of<br /><br />
haulage and access roads constructed during the early mining period that were not reclaimed are used<br /><br />
as foot paths to farms and villages<br /><br />
The proven washed bauxite reserves in the SML lease area are 12.5 million metric 4eigh with an overall<br /><br />
grade of 51% Al203, 48% available alumina (av. Al2O3) and 3.0 % Si02 but total reserves should be at least<br /><br />
30 million metric 4eigh. This reserve estimate will support production for approximately 20 years at an<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
annual production rate of 1.7 million metric 5eigh. The bauxite reserves are dispersed 20% around the<br /><br />
washing plant and 80%, 14-18 km haulage distance from the washing plant.<br /><br />

1.5 History and ownership of Bauxite Deposits<br /><br />
The exploration of Bauxite in Sierra Leone started in the 1920’s with the recording of low-grade bauxites<br /><br />
in and around the Freetown Peninsular and Kabala in the Northern Province. In 1958, the bauxite<br /><br />
potential in the Kasila Group Geology was initiated with the mapping of the Mokanji and Gbonge Hills.<br /><br />
On the basis of this study, the Sierra Leone Ore and Metal Company Limited (Sieromco) was formed as a<br /><br />
wholly owned subsidiary of a Swiss Company, Alusuisse.<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In 1961, Sieromco signed an agreement with the GOSL entitling Sieromco to prospect for and mine<br /><br />
bauxite in certain parts of the country. Sieromco commenced mining bauxite in Sierra Leone in<br /><br />
September 1963 in the Banta/Gbangbatoke and Dasse Chiefdoms in the Moyamba District. Sieromco<br /><br />
mined in the Mokanji area continuously for more than 19 years.<br /><br />
In 1982, following the depletion of the Mokanji deposits, Sieromco relocated its operations to Gondama<br /><br />
(approximately 26 km south-east of Mokanji) and resumed mining in the Banta Mokelleh Chiefdom.<br /><br />
Sieromco mined the Gondama deposits continuously until January 18, 1995, when the company<br /><br />
suspended operations and abandoned the mine site as a result of the civil war.<br /><br />
Alusuisse requested a consulting Firm BH&P to prepare a feasibility study in April 1995 for a possible<br /><br />
reopening of the Sieromco mines. The objectives of the evaluation were to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Confirm the practicality of the mining and transportation methods;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Evaluate possible alternatives; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Confirm and update the cost of projections.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Other considerations were also given to the possibility of combining the operations with Sierra Rutile<br /><br />
with arrangements made for contract mining.<br /><br />
Observations made took cognizance of many aspects of mining based on a ten year operating<br /><br />
experience and detailed operational data that were proven accurate.<br /><br />
On October 19, 2000, the GOSL reached an agreement with Alusuisse to acquire the assets and minerals<br /><br />
and mining rights of the company under the Sieromco Share Purchase Agreement. In December 2000,<br /><br />
Sieromco finally shutdown all its business dealings in Sierra Leone and handed over its assets to the<br /><br />
GOSL and relinquished Mining Lease 2131.<br /><br />
Sierra Rutile Limited (SRL) purchased these assets from the GOSL under the Sale and Purchase<br /><br />
Agreement of 20th. November 2001; and on December 1st of the same year, SRL was granted exploration<br /><br />
license EXPL 2/2001 for the area formerly covered by the Sieromco Mining Lease 2131. On 7th<br /><br />
December, 2001, SRL, with consent of the GOSL, assigned its rights under the above exploration license,<br /><br />
to Sierra Minerals Holdings Ltd.1. (SMHL) to fulfill all its obligations, title and interest.<br /><br />
SMHL was incorporated in British Virgin Islands and registered on October, 2001. On 3rd. June 2004,<br /><br />
SMHL entered into engineering, Procurement, construction and commissioning (EPPCC) Agreement with<br /><br />
PW Mining.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Another feasibility study was prepared and presented to the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) in May,<br /><br />
2003. The study which formed the basis of a re-start Plan was based on sound financial and technical<br /><br />
fundamentals considering the infrastructural and administrative synergies between SRL and SMHL1.<br /><br />
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment was undertaken by Aqua Terra Consulting during the<br /><br />
period February and March 2003 that served as the basis for the environmental impacts of the project<br /><br />
discussed in the Feasibility Study. In January 2005, SMHL was granted Mining Lease ML1/05 covering an<br /><br />
area of 321.7 km.<br /><br />
SMHL operated with two major contractors: PW Mining International, a full service contract mining<br /><br />
company which operates throughout Africa, and, CZAK Group which was involved in the shipping of the<br /><br />
ore product and other port operations. In 2008, SMHL was acquired to Vimetco Group and two years<br /><br />
later, SMHL, being a subsidiary of Vimetco Group continued with its mining operations selling all<br /><br />
products to ALUM Tulcea Refinery in Romania.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Page 7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Describes the prevailing baseline environmental and socio-economic conditions of<br /><br />
the study area and secondary data collection.<br /><br />
 Produces project overview including: management, Infrastructure and methods of<br /><br />
production.<br /><br />
 Describes the national and international regulatory framework applicable to bauxite<br /><br />
mining in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Determines project alternative scenarios.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Identifies, predicts and determines the intensity of the impacts on the receptors<br /><br />
using the information obtained from objective 1.<br /><br />
 Proposes mitigation measures that would be used to minimize these impacts and,<br /><br />
 Produces a summary of an Environmental Management Plan based on the<br /><br />
information obtained and that contained in the EMP.<br /><br />
During the preparation of the ESIA, the consultant was expected to conduct a Public Consultation and<br /><br />
Disclosure meetings with all stakeholders including the affected communities at chiefdom, district and<br /><br />
regional levels. These were held to solicit feedback from all stakeholder’s concerns, and if possible<br /><br />
further mitigation measures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.7 Scope of Study<br /><br />
In pursuance of achieving the above objectives, the Consultant has encompassed the following<br /><br />
tasks/scope of works:<br /><br />
1. Worked closely together with the Company’s Environmental Health and Safety Department.<br /><br />
2. Referred to all<br /><br />
<br /><br />
relevant existing environmental documents including local, national, and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
international legal and regulatory framework for bauxite mining, especially with particular<br /><br />
reference to literature, documentations and data source of Vimetco SMHL Ltd in Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
3. Ensured that the final ESIA conformed to ‘best practice’ norms; and met conventional<br /><br />
International Standards for Environmental, Social Policy and Procedures, and National<br /><br />
requirements.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4. Described and assessed salient environmental and social concerns within the mining and<br /><br />
processing activities of the Company, with particular emphases on the area of Influence 1.<br /><br />
5. Determined the current environmental and social baseline conditions of the project site and its<br /><br />
surroundings on the basis of the existing data on geology, hydrology, ambient air and water<br /><br />
quality, biological diversity, demography and socio-economic parameters.<br /><br />
6. Identified and assessed the environmental and social issues associated with the mining,<br /><br />
production and exporting activities of the Company; and determined mitigation measures to<br /><br />
minimize any potential adverse environmental and social impacts during the operational and<br /><br />
post-mining phases of the activities.<br /><br />
7. Prepared an ESIA document based on the requirements of EPA-SL.<br /><br />
The environmental and socio-economic baseline for the ESIA has been based on data already gathered;<br /><br />
as well as baseline conditions observed in the course of our field visits to the site (3 visits from 5 th to 10th<br /><br />
October 2012); and other available relevant documents obtained through local governmental and nongovernmental organizations.<br /><br />
1.8 Study Constraints and Limitations.<br /><br />
This ESIA was expected to commence in August 2012 with the aim of submitting the report to the client<br /><br />
in October 2012. Thereafter, an onward submission and feedback from EPA would take place before a<br /><br />
public consultation and disclosure process. Although the consultant worked closely with the client, some<br /><br />
delay was caused in finalising the report and to receive the license.<br /><br />
Othe factors that acted as limitations to the study include:<br /><br />
 Absence of government officials, NGOs and and other local leaders in the consultative meetings<br /><br />
during the field work;<br /><br />
 Inadequacy of updated documentation including maps and other unclassified documents;<br /><br />
 Absence of some community members to participate fully in the consultative meetings due to<br /><br />
the limited time available between farm work, meeting gatherings and other domestic<br /><br />
responsibilities;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Secondary data that were collected on the villages were not reliable as these have not been<br /><br />
frequently updated. This is particularly so in the case of demography and agricultural production<br /><br />
trends.<br /><br />
 It was not possible to undertake a detailed taxonomic assessment of fauna and flora species due<br /><br />
to the limited time available;<br /><br />
Instead, the assessment presented here supplements other studies already undertaken in previous<br /><br />
years.<br /><br />
1.9 Study Approach<br /><br />
The approach to this ESIA consists of the following phases as outlined in the EPA Act of 2008 as<br /><br />
amended in 2010: Screening, Scoping, Impact Assessment and Public Disclosure.<br /><br />
Screening: This is the initial phase which decides if an ESIA is required for the project and to determine<br /><br />
the extent to which the assessment will be. According to the EPA Guidelines and safeguard policies of<br /><br />
the lending institutions, this is a Class A project because it has the potential to have significant<br /><br />
environmental impacts, which in turn may have an effect on the facilities and those communities that<br /><br />
are affected by mining operations. As required by EPA Act, a Screening form was completed and<br /><br />
submitted to EPA detailing the need and level of the assessment, the acceptability of the consultant and<br /><br />
the public participation process.<br /><br />
Scoping: The scoping phase involved identification of key issues in the screening phase that were further<br /><br />
investigated based on desktop study of relevant environmental and social data collected from published<br /><br />
reports and previous studies of the project area. Stakeholder consultations were undertaken to<br /><br />
determine additional data required for the evaluation of the baseline conditions and the potential<br /><br />
impacts of the project. Public meetings were held in which a diverse group of community members<br /><br />
including local authorities, traditional leaders, opinion leaders, local council representatives, youths and<br /><br />
women’s groups were invited to participate in the surveys.<br /><br />
A door to door sample socioeconomic survey (using a semi-structured questionnaire) was conducted in<br /><br />
43 communities spanning the five chiefdoms (Upper Banta, Lower Banta, Kpanda Kemoh, Bumpe Ngao<br /><br />
and Dasse Chiefdoms respectively).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Other key environmental issues associated with the project that were identified and discussed during<br /><br />
scoping consultation include impacts on:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Biophysical Environment: Air quality, Noise quality, Surface water quality, Ground water quality,<br /><br />
Soils, Land use capability and Biodiversity.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Socio-economic and cultural Environment: Demography, education, health and sanitation, water<br /><br />
supply, agriculture and farming practices, Social and Political organizations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Impact Assessment Phase: This involved an assessment of the significance of the potential impacts<br /><br />
including the cumulative impacts and recommended mitigation measures that could minimise impacts.<br /><br />
The methodology applied for this assessment is presented in the methodology section that is outlined<br /><br />
below. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared that clearly defines all the<br /><br />
residual and other specific actions that SMHL undertakes to implement the measures that will minimise<br /><br />
and mitigate any negative impacts on the human, social and environmental aspects within the project<br /><br />
area. A summary of the EMP is produced under a separate chapter of this report. The plan includes an<br /><br />
Environmental Monitoring Plan, Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (ERCP), Tailings<br /><br />
Management Plan (TMP) and Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan (MRCP).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.10 Methodology<br /><br />
The methodology for collecting data for the preparation of this ESIA was based on desk study,<br /><br />
stakeholder consultation and field survey.<br /><br />
Desk Study: Relevant reports, literature and other documents were collected and a detailed review of<br /><br />
the secondary data was undertaken during the course of the study. The major reports included the<br /><br />
following:<br /><br />
 Feasibility study report of 2003<br /><br />
 SMHL ESIA and Environmental Social Action Plan (ESAP) reports of 2003<br /><br />
 Exploration and survey reports prepared for SMHL and previous owners the bauxite deposits.<br /><br />
 Community Development Action Plan (CDAP) report of 2010.<br /><br />
 Environmental Management Plan report of 2010.<br /><br />
 SMHL 3rd.quarterEnvironmental Monitoring report of 2012.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
 SMHL Environmental Report of 2012 for License renewal.<br /><br />
 National and International Policy Documents and,<br /><br />
 Public Data that is available from the Internet.<br /><br />
All of these provided more information about the project and contributed to the improvement of the<br /><br />
data collection.<br /><br />
Impact Prediction: An assessment of the significance of the impacts was made using established<br /><br />
standards and professional judgment. The conventions that were adopted include: a. Significant Rating<br /><br />
Scales; b. Timescales; c. Spatial Scale; d. Likelihood and, e. Severity.<br /><br />
The significant rating scale developed by Weaver and Caldwell (1999) was adapted for this study. This is<br /><br />
explained in Table 1. Timescales are related to the estimated duration of the impacts. The timescales<br /><br />
for rating the impacts in this report are short-term (0-5yrs) medium term (6- 20 years) and long-term<br /><br />
(more than 20 years). Short-term impacts are those that occur during construction and initial operation<br /><br />
activities that may or not be mitigated during the construction period or after.<br /><br />
Spatial scales which describe the spatial extent of an impact in terms of the amount of area affected, i.e.<br /><br />
localized or widespread were expressed as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Localised i.e. an impact limited to a small part of the project’s operational area e.g. a few<br /><br />
hundred hectares in extent.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Study Area i.e. impact limited to the immediate vicinity of the project area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Regional i.e. impact limited to the general vicinity of the project area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
National i.e. impact limited to the country as a whole.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Global i.e. impact limited to the global environment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: December; 2012.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 12<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Likelihood is the probability that the impact would occur or not. It is explained as: very unlikely, unlikely<br /><br />
and likely. This criterion was applied to all the potential negative impacts in order to determine whether<br /><br />
or not the impacts can be minimised.<br /><br />
The severity of an impact was determined by the magnitude of the significance based on the extent to<br /><br />
which the impact would change under existing conditions or how it would impact upon another<br /><br />
receptor. It is explained as very severe, severe, moderately severe, slightly severe and no effect.<br /><br />
The application of checklists and interaction matrices finally enabled the assessment to arrive at: a. Brief<br /><br />
description of the expected or predicted environmental changes that would result during the operation<br /><br />
of the project. b. Measures that would be implemented to avoid adverse impacts on the environment<br /><br />
and, c. An assessment of the possible alternatives including proposed actions.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Of the highest order possible within the bounds of impacts which would occur.<br /><br />
In the case of negative impacts, there would be no mitigation and/or remedial<br /><br />
activity to offset the impact at the spatial or timescale for which it was predicted.<br /><br />
In the case of positive impacts there is no real alternative to achieving the<br /><br />
benefit.<br /><br />
In the case of negative impacts, mitigation and/or remedial activity would be<br /><br />
feasible but difficult, expensive, time-consuming or some combination of these.<br /><br />
In the case of positive impacts, other means of achieving this benefit would be<br /><br />
feasible, but these would be more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming or<br /><br />
some combination of these.<br /><br />
Impact would be real but not substantial within the bounds of those, which could<br /><br />
occur. In the case of negative impacts, mitigation and/or remedial activity would<br /><br />
be both feasible and fairly easily possible. In the case of positive impacts, other<br /><br />
means of achieving this benefit would be about equal in time<br /><br />
Impact would be of a low order and with little real effect. In the case of negative<br /><br />
impacts, mitigation and/or remedial activity would be either easily achieved or<br /><br />
little would be required, or both. In the case of positive impacts, alternative<br /><br />
means for achieving this benefit would likely be easier, cheaper, more effective,<br /><br />
less time-consuming, or a combination of these<br /><br />
Impact would be negligible. In the case of negative impacts, almost no<br /><br />
mitigation and/or remedial activity would be needed, and any minor steps that<br /><br />
might be needed would be easy, cheap and simple. In the case of positive<br /><br />
impacts, alternative means would almost all likely to be better, in one or a<br /><br />
number of ways, than this means of achieving the benefit.<br /><br />
No impacts, not even a very low impact on the system or any of its parts.<br /><br />

Stakeholder Consultation: Stakeholder engagement provided the team an opportunity for the<br /><br />
stakeholders to ask questions discuss the project and express any concerns they have, so that SMHL will<br /><br />
be able to respond to comments received. The main objectives of the stakeholder consultation process<br /><br />
were to:<br /><br />
 Facilitate open communication with all interested stakeholders;<br /><br />
 Build an open relationship with the local community of the lease area;<br /><br />
 Provide timely and easily understood information to stakeholders in an appropriate nontechnical format;<br /><br />
 Open consultation with all stakeholders to ascertain and discuss their opinions and concerns;<br /><br />
 Propose and establish formal and informal public consultation and participation procedures;<br /><br />
 Establish accessible and effective systems for reporting, investigating and resolving grievances<br /><br />
separately for both SMHL and the affected community; and<br /><br />
 To establish stakeholder engagement as an integral part of on-going environmental and social<br /><br />
impact assessment activity, making sure that mitigation measures are addressed.<br /><br />
The surveys gathered consensus information about key existing conditions, such as infrastructure and<br /><br />
microeconomic trends. The questions in the community survey covered the following areas:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Community infrastructure, including education, health care facilities etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Social and cultural institutions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Gender issues.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Social and economic trends.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
General opinion on the operation of SMHL.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Crop Compensation and,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Drinking water facility.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Field Survey: Following the stakeholder consultation, a field survey was undertaken with the purpose of<br /><br />
obtaining an overview of the entire operational area that would complement information gathered<br /><br />
during the consultative meetings. Specifically, site walks were conducted particularly around the mine<br /><br />

<br /><br />
sites and dams and the routing of the biophysical and social issues that arise as a result of project<br /><br />
operations. Topographic maps at a scale of 1:50,000 were used as a base for mapping of the biophysical<br /><br />
features. GIS technology and software were used for capturing and analysing field data.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Socio-economic Survey: A door to door sample socioeconomic survey (using a semi-structured<br /><br />
questionnaire) was conducted in 43 communities spanning the five chiefdoms (Upper Banta, Lower<br /><br />
Banta, Kpanda Kemoh, Bumpe Ngao and Dasse Chiefdoms respectively). The questionnaire were<br /><br />
administered by trained enumerators (9) drawn among resident community members of mostly<br /><br />
teachers. They were closely supervised to ensure effective administration of survey questionnaire and in<br /><br />
turn report to the consultant in charge. The data collected were coded and entered into the SPSS<br /><br />
version 16.0 spread sheet by a trained data entry clerk. Detailed analysis undertaken using frequency<br /><br />
counts, descriptive statistics, cross tabulations, to identify statistically significant differences between<br /><br />
the results of the various segments.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The household survey was based on a random sample of 180 households and focuses on gathering data<br /><br />
on the socioeconomic baselines of the community influenced by the mining operations. The questions<br /><br />
were designed to seek information on the population and dwelling units, income, livelihood, health,<br /><br />
community participation, resource use and general attitude towards Vimetco SMHL and<br /><br />
concerns/opinions and expectations of the community in the project area. The questionnaire were<br /><br />
administered by trained enumerators (9) drawn among residence community members mostly teachers.<br /><br />
They were closely supervised to ensure effective administration of survey questionnaire and in turn<br /><br />

Focus Group Discussions: Focus Group Discussions were conducted in which a diverse group of<br /><br />
community members including local authorities, traditional leaders, opinion leaders, local council<br /><br />
representatives, youths and women’s groups were invited to participate. These generally consisted of<br /><br />
focus group discussion/meeting. A total of 5 focus group discussions were held in each of these<br /><br />
chiefdoms as shown below. The issues discussed covered the following areas: a. Community<br /><br />
infrastructure. B. Social and cultural institutions. C. Access to public Services such as education, health<br /><br />
and sanitation. D. Gender issues. E. Social and economic trends and, f. Agricultural production.<br /><br />
All the views expressed by the affected communities helped to identify and evaluate the social and<br /><br />
environmental impacts and the formulation of the mitigation measures. Details of the socio-economic<br /><br />
survey are presented in the Annex of this report.<br /><br />
The household survey was based on a random sample of 180 households and focused on gathering data<br /><br />

community participation, resource use and general attitude towards Vimetco SMHL and<br /><br />
concerns/opinions and expectations of the community in the project area.<br /><br />
1.11. Project Benefits<br /><br />
Apart from the direct financial benefit to the company, an array of other direct and indirect benefits<br /><br />
that the project could have on the mining community and the country at large are outlined below.<br /><br />
Economic Benefits: The capital expenditure over the life of mine was estimated in 2003 at $28.6 million<br /><br />
in nominal terms excluding capital investment by contractors. This was mainly associated with<br /><br />
refurbishment and purchase of new equipment. In 2010 SMHL Vimetco acquired the bauxite mines from<br /><br />
Titanium Resources Group (TRG) with a market capital of $189 million. The injection of this amount of<br /><br />
money in foreign exchange has boosted the economy of Sierra Leone in terms of foreign exchange<br /><br />
earnings. The project is also generating economic benefits to the GOSL in terms of taxes, duties and<br /><br />
royalties as specified in the mining code.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Secondly, the project directly and indirectly is injecting money into the local economy through salaries<br /><br />
to workers and supplies outsourced locally which thereby is increasing the purchasing power of the local<br /><br />
population.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Job Creation: SMHL is continuing to create permanent employment in its operation for over 700<br /><br />
permanent staff and about 200 for casual workers. Job creation is benefiting people at the local and<br /><br />
national levels going well beyond welfare improvements for employees themselves. This is having a<br /><br />
positive effect throughout the local economy resulting in increased demand for goods and services, and<br /><br />
for business and income improvement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Roads Infrastructure: Most of these roads built before SMHL operations were totally damaged during<br /><br />
the war. The haulage roads to the Gbonge deposits required major road construction work. The existing<br /><br />
road from Gondama to Nitti harbour was also in a serious state of disrepair as a result of lack of<br /><br />
maintenance during inter-war years. Since operations started, SMHL has reconstructed and resurfaced<br /><br />
all roads in its operational area and is investing in maintenance of local roads with other 17eighbouring<br /><br />
companies in the project area. This is facilitating a speedy movement of goods, agricultural produce and<br /><br />
people within and outside the concession area.<br /><br />
Community Development Initiatives: Since November 2012, the company has been financing<br /><br />
community development initiatives within the purview of SMHL Foundation in the five chiefdoms and in<br /><br />
the following priority areas of interventions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Continued rehabilitation of major roads and haul roads in the concession area;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Joint venture rehabilitation of other major roads in the Moyamba District;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of Maternity and Child Health Post with facilities at Kanga in the Lower Banta<br /><br />
Chiefdom;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of hand dug wells fitted with pumps in six towns and villages;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of class-room building for a junior secondary school at Badjia Junction in Dasse<br /><br />
Chiefdom;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provision of building materials to households affected by fire accidents in the community;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provision of services and supplies to the Serabu Hospital and Mokanji Police Station; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Offer of scholarships and tuition to students resident in the mining community.<br /><br />

Section 2 – Project Description<br /><br />
This section gives an overview of the project including mining methods and infrastructure. Details of<br /><br />
SMHL project overview presented here are those obtained during the field survey.<br /><br />
2.1 Project Management and Workforce<br /><br />
The SMHL has a highly skilled and experienced workforce with an organizational management capable<br /><br />
of running the project at management and supervisory levels. It comprises the General Manager,<br /><br />
Department Managers, Supervisory positions, Foreman positions and the General Staff in the form of<br /><br />
administration, maintenance, and support services.<br /><br />
SMHL’s General Manager is based at the mine site, and reports to the CEO and manage the SMHL<br /><br />
operations through a structure of Five (5) Departmental Managers and Five (5) Unit Managers. SMHL<br /><br />
Organizational Structure is presented in Figure 9. The General Manager has the overall responsibility for<br /><br />
SMHL operations and collaborates with the other Departmental Managers, including the Production and<br /><br />
Geology Manager, Technical and Repairs Manager, Procurement and Logistics Manager, Finance and IT<br /><br />
Manager, Human Resource and Administration Manager. The responsibilities of these Departmental<br /><br />
Managers will encompass the whole SMHL operations, thus providing valuable human resources for the<br /><br />
SMHL Manager to utilize.<br /><br />
An effective recruitment methodology and an ongoing training and development programs improve the<br /><br />
quality of the personnel to maintain efficiency and sustainability.<br /><br />
A further reduction of the SMHL workforce by contracting operations with clearly defined boundaries<br /><br />
and measurable production units reflect reduction in operating cost models. The operations that are<br /><br />
wholly or partly contracted are as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10% Transportation of ore mined to the Washing Plant;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10% Transportation of washed bauxite to Nitti; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Security Service provision.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SMHL Department/Unit personnel numbers classified into expatriates, and SL employees and contract<br /><br />
are summarized in the following table. Beginning February 2012, the mine has operated on three (3)<br /><br />
shifts each on eight (8) hours schedule for a twenty-four (24) hours period. Haulage fleets will be run on<br /><br />
two (2) shifts beginning at 700 am to 2300 pm at night. The remaining third (3rd) shift is schedule for ore<br /><br />
processing, repairs and maintenance only at the plant site.<br /><br />
Vimetco, like any other mining projects in a production stage and with a good human personnel<br /><br />
management record world-wide, operates it’s mine with normal hours of work not less than or more<br /><br />
than 44 hours per week.<br /><br />

Water resources within/proximity to SMHL lease are abundant. Due to the large quantities of water<br /><br />
required by bauxite wash process, water is sourced at the Taia River and pumped to a 5000 m 3 capacity<br /><br />
reservoir which in turn runs to the plant site by gravity method.<br /><br />

2.3 Ore Reserves and Exploration Methods<br /><br />
In 2003 the proven and probable bauxite reserves in the lease area were estimated at 12.5 million<br /><br />
metric tonnes with an overall grade of 53.1 percent Al2O3, 50.1 percent available alumina (av. Al2O3)<br /><br />
and SiO2. This reserve estimate has supported the production for the last ten years at an annual<br /><br />
production of 1.2 million metric tonnes. These reserves were established from the systematic drilling<br /><br />
and sampling carried out by Sieromco.<br /><br />
SMHL accepted the estimated resource figures during the course of their due diligence study in late<br /><br />
2009 undertaking by SC BELEVION IMPEX SRL. Based on historical data and those recently generated by<br /><br />
SMHL-Vimetco, a proven and probable reserve of 31 million tonnes of washed bauxite ore, grading 50.1<br /><br />
to 49.1% Al2O3 and 3.0 – 4.0% SiO2 have been reported. This reserve estimate will support production<br /><br />
for approximately 18 years at an annual production rate of 1.7 million metric tonnes. The current<br /><br />
reserves have been estimated from the Gondama Konta, Wunde and Gbonge groups of deposits.<br /><br />
Exploration work programme is in progress (i.e. mapping, drilling and sampling) to verify the tens of<br /><br />
millions of bauxite within or around the beneficiation plant and the Gbonge deposits in order to<br /><br />
establish newer deposits and to increase the current reserve status of SMHL lease. Development drilling<br /><br />
and sampling are also being carried out to support mine planning and eventual mining.<br /><br />
The exploration program involves line cutting, pitting, drilling, sampling and assaying. The entire lease<br /><br />
area was prospected and classified by Sieromco into measured, indicated or inferred resources. Based<br /><br />
on this available information, SMHL has primarily been engaged in validating these reported resources<br /><br />
(Konta, Wunde, Jenega and Gbonge) in generating its current reserve base and the extension of SMHL<br /><br />
mine life. Exploration pitting and drilling are initially done on a wide grid of 160 X 40 meters and then<br /><br />
closed in to 80x40 meter grid spacing for a resource purpose. Drill/pit grids are further reduced to a<br /><br />
40x40 or 40X20 meter grid for the purpose of estimating reserves.<br /><br />
Drilling is done using EVH Explorer 2012 Reverse circulation rig. The rig generates chips of laterite or<br /><br />
bauxite that are cut by drill bits down hole. The drill chips are sent to a sample collecting bin by an air<br /><br />
pressure. The drill chips are sampled and logged in approximately 1m intervals. Each sample is bagged<br /><br />
and labelled for assaying at Gondama Laboratory.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At mine site laboratory samples are weighed to determine the bulk weight of each sample. Particle size<br /><br />
of samples which are +16mm, are reduced to ensure sample is 100% passing 16mm screen. Samples are<br /><br />
mixed to obtain a homogeneously representative sample and then split into two. One half is stored as<br /><br />
reserve sample and the remaining portion is oven dried at 105oC. Dried sample are crushed and<br /><br />
pulverized to 95% passing 500microns for PIMA and XRF analyses. Using the Portable Infra-red Mineral<br /><br />
Analyzer (PIMA), all the samples were analyzed for Total Alumina, Total Silica and Iron Oxides.<br /><br />
Ore Modeling<br /><br />
Preliminary ore modeling has been undertaken on the few of the deposits using Mine Map, a<br /><br />
resource/reserve modeling and mine planning software program which uses both inverse distance<br /><br />
weighting (IDW) and geostatistics to estimate reserves.<br /><br />
The drill hole data on the deposits are processed to meet the database upload requirements of the<br /><br />
software. Initial investigations on grade are made in terms of Available Alumina (AA), which is defined<br /><br />
as “percent alumina minus percent silica”. Definition of the database and upload of data are done,<br /><br />
followed by extraction of drill hole sections.<br /><br />
The drill holes are colored on the basis of grade. Using cut-offs of 48% AA, mineralized zones on each<br /><br />
section were demarcated, which would subsequently serve as constraints for block grade assignment.<br /><br />
Grade interpolation is done in a regularized block model using inverse distance weighting (IDW)<br /><br />
techniques. Block sizes are 10m by 10m in the y and x directions, and 5m in the z direction. Powers of 2<br /><br />
and 3 respectively were used, to enforce preferential weighting along strike over the cross-strike<br /><br />
direction.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This is done in compliance with the notion that controls on mineralization (primarily<br /><br />
<br /><br />
lithological) have a greater influence along the strike of the ore body than across.<br /><br />
2.4 Mining and Ore Beneficiation<br /><br />
SMHL bauxite project at Gondama, southern Sierra Leone is based on auto-generated ‘self-mining’;<br /><br />
however, the project still requires significant level of capital expenditure inflows to procure the required<br /><br />
mining fleet and necessary support equipment. Prior to this time, the project was on contract mining<br /><br />
which became more costly on a unit cost basis and in November 2010, SMHL-Vimetco took over the<br /><br />
mining operation.<br /><br />
The production planning periods include the short-term plan (One Year) and a long-term plan (or more<br /><br />
years). The short-term plan is target oriented and driven more by Alum-Tulcea demand and<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
specifications of the washed bauxite product while the long range plan are covered by mining options,<br /><br />
mining sequence, mine development, operating cost estimates and strategic issues related to the overall<br /><br />
improvement of the mining operations.<br /><br />
Fig 2. Wide-Angle View of Administrative Building; Processing Plant; and Environs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The SMHL bauxite mining is an open cast mining which requires no blasting of the ore prior to its<br /><br />
excavation. The overburden is removed by dozers and the ore is freely dug or ripped with dozers (D8,<br /><br />
D9). Prior to mining a deposit, the area is demarcated of its ore limit (Staking-out done by mine<br /><br />
surveyors); the demarcated area is then striped/cleared of vegetation and Topsoil, Overburden<br /><br />
removed, using a D8/D9 CAT bulldozer. The vegetation and Topsoil are stored and the overburden<br /><br />
stockpiled. The rotted vegetation and or Topsoil are stored for subsequent use in land re-forestation and<br /><br />
the overburden for reclamation purposes after depletion.<br /><br />
The exposed ore is then mined and excavated, loaded into 20 -25 tonne class off-highway rear dump<br /><br />
trucks, and transported to the washing plant. Multiple mining faces are developed and mined<br /><br />
simultaneously to achieve required blending. The material processing consist of feeding, crushing,<br /><br />
washing, vibratory-screening, classifying and storing of the bauxite ore to produce an exportable<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
material with a grade and reactive silica content that will satisfy costumer/market demands. Process<br /><br />
water for the plant is pumped from the Taia River over a distance of about 1.8 km to an existing water<br /><br />
reservoir of about 5,000 m3 from where the water gravitates to the washing plant.<br /><br />
The washing operation involves the removal of clays, silicate and ferruginous minerals/materials which<br /><br />
enters into the slimes as tails and the hand picking of gangue materials from the conveyor belts. The<br /><br />
aim is to upgrade the alumina content and reduce the silica content from the run of mine feed to a<br /><br />
marketable product.<br /><br />
To yield the 1.7 million tonnes of washed bauxite per year the plant operates at a minimum of 18.3<br /><br />
hours per day and 310 days per year. The maximum production rate depends upon the efficiency of the<br /><br />
mining methods and grade controls, since grades and ore recovery are the principal issues in achieving a<br /><br />
marketable product.<br /><br />
A supplementary new water pump has been installed in the plant to recycle used water in order to<br /><br />
reduce/decrease the quantity of water extracted from the Taia River. In an effort to reduce the amount<br /><br />
of slimes discharged into the tailings pond, the granulometric cut of the finest recovered bauxite in the<br /><br />
plant have been reduced from 2mm to 1mm to increase plant recovery/production and hence reduce<br /><br />
the volume of tails disposed into the ponds and hence the streams/rivers down valley. Figure3<br /><br />
represents a simplified processes flow diagram involved/employed in the recovery of washed bauxite<br /><br />
ore through the beneficiation plant.<br /><br />

2.5 Bauxite Product Shipping<br /><br />
Final bauxite product is transported by road to the marine port at Nitti in haulage units of 30 tonne<br /><br />
capacity. The distance between the Gondama Washing Plant and Nitti is 38 kilometers. At Nitti, the<br /><br />
bauxite is stockpiled in preparation for shipment.<br /><br />
The existing dryer located at Nitti harbour is reported to have a rated drying capacity of 110 mtph. The<br /><br />
moisture content of washing plant bauxite product is expected to be 14-15% without the use of any<br /><br />
dewatering agents or dewatering screens. However, high moisture content bauxite is difficult to handle<br /><br />
due to its ‘stickiness’ and tendency to freeze in extremely cold weather conditions in parts of Europe.<br /><br />
Moisture reduction from 14-15% down to around 10%, will therefore be necessary to improve its<br /><br />
handling characteristics.<br /><br />
During shipment, the bauxite is loaded from the stockpile by front end loaders onto the conveyor and<br /><br />
into the barges of 2,000 tonne capacity. The loaded barges are moved by pushboat down the Sherbro<br /><br />
River to the Atlantic to meet the ore carriers that are specially adapted with mobile lifting cranes fitted<br /><br />
with grabs to load the bauxite into the ship. These ore carriers are generally compartmentalized into<br /><br />
hatches so that they can load more than one type of product in one shipment. The capacities of the ore<br /><br />
carriers that have been loaded from this port vary from 25,000 to 40,000 metric tons.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.6 Power Generation<br /><br />
SMHL runs three Power Generation each located at Nitti, Gondama and Mata camp where<br /><br />
accommodation and recreation facilities are located 20 km from Gondama and Nitti respectively.<br /><br />
Back-up generators will be stationed at the village and construction camp in case of a power outage in<br /><br />
the distribution grid that will normally supply these sites.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.7 Water Management<br /><br />
The main sources of water in the mines are from the Taia River and the dams that have been<br /><br />
constructed not far from the mining locations. Process water for the plant is pumped from the Taia River<br /><br />
over a distance of about 1.8 km to an existing water reservoir of about 5,000 m3 from where the water<br /><br />
gravitates to the washing plant naturally. The table below (Table 5) is a survey carried out to measure<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the volumetric flow rate of the Taia River along and across a cross-section of the river, where SMHL<br /><br />
pump station is erected.<br /><br />
The major water uses at SMHL include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ore beneficiation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Dust suppression;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Water use in toilet facilities;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Vehicle wash-down; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Irrigation at the nursery site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All these sources meet the demands at SMHL with no recycling methods applied as yet.<br /><br />
Ground water abstraction is negligible even though one hand dug well has been constructed for drinking<br /><br />
purposes.<br /><br />
Consistent wet weather conditions during the first half of the reporting period there was an increase in<br /><br />
the need for dust suppression along haul roads and other surface activities.<br /><br />

2.8 MINES SECURITY<br /><br />
During the period from January 2003 to December 31, 2007, the mine site was under the protection of<br /><br />
SRL security force on a fulltime basis. In 2008, the G4S security service providers took over that<br /><br />
responsibility on January 1, 2008. All SRL personnel with good records were absorbed into the new G4S<br /><br />

<br /><br />
security force. Suitable applicants were recruited and trained to fill the remaining vacant positions and<br /><br />
provide protection for all SMHL mine facilities.<br /><br />
The current G4S security force consists of 168 guards comprising 2 expatriate managers, 3 senior<br /><br />
supervisors, 15 junior supervisors, 12 master guards and 136 general security guards. The G4S and the<br /><br />
Sierra Leone Police Force (SLPF) establish a dual-purpose force comprising a Security Protection Force<br /><br />
(i.e. SLPF) who are armed to provide defensive capability in and around the mine facilities and a Security<br /><br />
Guard Force (G4S) to protect company assets against theft.<br /><br />
Over the past years, the SMHL mining areas have been incident free and the main focus of the security<br /><br />
force has been loss prevention. The SMHL Security Force has an excellent relationship with local<br /><br />
community leaders and local government authorities.<br /><br />

Section Three - Policy, Legal and Instituitional Framework<br /><br />
3.1 National Legislations<br /><br />
Constitution of Sierra Leone, 1991<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of mining activities, the Constitution makes provision for the protection of the rights of<br /><br />
individuals to private property, and also sets principles under which citizens may be deprived of their<br /><br />
property in the public interest as described in Section 21. It also makes provision for the prompt<br /><br />
payment of adequate compensation and access to the court or other impartial and independent<br /><br />
authority for the determination of the land owner’s interest or right, and the amount of any<br /><br />
compensation to which he/she is entitled and for the purpose of obtaining prompt payment of that<br /><br />
compensation.<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: SMHL project is a central development activity that makes use of the human<br /><br />
and biophysical environment. As such, an EMP and crop compensation procedures are implemented to<br /><br />
address these issues.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The National Environmental Policy: 1990<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The National Environmental Policy (NEP) was approved by cabinet since 1990 and was subsequently<br /><br />
revised in 1994 (GOSL, 1994). The policy objectives are to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Secure for all Sierra Leoneans a quality of environment adequate for their health and well-being;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Conserve and use the environment and natural resources for the benefit of present and future<br /><br />
generation; restore, maintain and enhance the ecosystems and ecological processes essential<br /><br />
for the functioning of the biosphere; to preserve biological diversity, and uphold the principle of<br /><br />
optimum sustainable yield in the use of living natural resources and ecosystems;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Raise public awareness and promote understanding of the essential linkages between the<br /><br />
environment and development and to encourage individual participation in environmental<br /><br />
improvement efforts.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: This ESIA was carried out to fulfil the obligatory requirements of the NEP since<br /><br />
mining is likely to have significant impacts on the environment.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The Wildlife Conservation Act, 1972<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Wildlife Conservation Act of 1972 was enacted to help regulate the utilization and protection of<br /><br />
wildlife resources. However, the bill is characterized by inadequate capacity for implementation and<br /><br />
enforcement and insufficient and unsustainable sources of funding. The bill is also outdated and merits<br /><br />
review and update to reflect current trends in wildlife protection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Factories Act 1974<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Factories Act of 1974 addresses workers health and safety issues associated with factories. Portions<br /><br />
of the construction activities fall within the definition of a factory based on the following conditions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Part II section 3(v)-“any premises in which mechanical power is used in connection with the<br /><br />
making or repair of articles of metal or wood incidental to any business carried on by way of<br /><br />
trade or for purposes of gain”.<br /><br />

to the provisions of this Act. All persons employed by SMHL are required to undergo medical<br /><br />
examinations to ascertain their fitness and also to maintain their health and safety at the workplace.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Forestry Act: 1988<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The mining of bauxite involves the clearing of the natural vegetation or forest within its operational<br /><br />
area.<br /><br />
Section 18 of this Act stipulates that: The Chiefdom Council of any chiefdom may conclude an<br /><br />
agreement with the Chief Conservator of forests providing for the constitution as a community forest of<br /><br />
any land within the chiefdom, subject to the approval of the District Officer for the District in which the<br /><br />
land is situated.<br /><br />
Every Agreement under this section shall:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Describe the area included in the forest by reference to geographical features, markers, coordinates and measurements and indicate the same on a map of suitable scale, which shall be<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Section 24 of the Act lists project activities requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment license which<br /><br />
include mining.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sections 25 and 26 describe factors for determining whether a project requires an environmental<br /><br />
impact assessment and the contents of the environmental impact assessment respectively.<br /><br />
The Act describes the procedures to be followed to obtain permits for both existing and proposed<br /><br />
undertakings through the conduct of environmental impact assessments.<br /><br />
The Environmental Protection Agency (Amendment) Act, 2010 gave executive powers to the Board.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: Land, water, forest and air resources are major components of the natural<br /><br />
environment. Bauxite mining operations at all stages are impacting on these resources.Extractive uses of<br /><br />
these resources are guided by the various programmes, plans, regulations under the EPA/SL. Adherence<br /><br />
to the relevant legal provision is a requirement in the entire course of SMHL operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Local Government Act, 2004<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Act establishes the Local Council (LC) as the highest political authority in the locality and confers<br /><br />
legislative and executive powers to be exercised in accordance with this Act. This Act in its First Schedule<br /><br />
under Section 2 establishes the localities, namely: districts, towns and cities. Part II of this schedule also<br /><br />
establishes the number of Paramount Chiefs in each LC. The Third Schedule establishes the functions<br /><br />
devolved to the LCs. The Fourth and Fifth Schedules establish departments under each LC, and a<br /><br />
Valuation List and Rate Books respectively.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: Public consultation and community involvement constitute a core element of<br /><br />
SMHL operations. The implementation of the Community Development Action Plan is done in<br /><br />
collaboration with the local council.<br /><br />
National Lands Policy, 2005<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As provided in the Constitution, the 2005 National Land Policy makes provision for the compulsory<br /><br />
acquisition of land in the public interest. The principles of the land policy include among others:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The principle of land as a common national or communal property resource held in trust for the<br /><br />
people and which must be used in the long term interest of the people of Sierra Leone.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Page 35<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Compensation to be paid for lands acquired through compulsory government acquisition will be<br /><br />
fair and adequate and will be determined, among other things, through negotiations that take<br /><br />
into consideration government investment in the area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Local Authorities (City and District Councils) may negotiate for land for project development<br /><br />
purposes, but all such grants should be properly documented and processed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No interest in or right over any land belonging to an individual or family can be disposed of<br /><br />
without consultation with the owner or occupier of the land.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No interest in or right over any land belonging to an individual or family can be compulsorily acquired<br /><br />
without payment, in reasonable time, of fair and adequate compensation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the project: During mining, large land areas are acquired for exploration, excavation and<br /><br />
removal of bauxite deposits. SMHL management will therefore be required to ensure proper<br /><br />
reclamation work.<br /><br />
3.2 International Regulatory Framework<br /><br />
Sierra Leone is signatory to many regulatory framework relevant to mining. Below is a summary of the<br /><br />
key conventions, treaties and protocols.<br /><br />
United Nations Convention on Biodiversity<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sierra Leone became signatory to this Convention in 1994. This is one of the tools that translate the<br /><br />
Principles of Agenda 21 also known as the Rio Summit. Parties to this convention affirm their right over<br /><br />
their biological resources making sure that these resources are used in a sustainable manner.<br /><br />
The relevance of the CBD stems from the fact that mining activities result to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Loss of habitat and fragmentation and the resultant development of waste rock dumps;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pollution of habitats and water supplies and the creation solid waste such as tailings;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Green House gas emission resulting from the use of heavy duty machinery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If adequate mitigation measure measures are not undertaken biodiversity in the project area could be<br /><br />
threatened or lost.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: As much as possible SMHL operations will involve implementation of<br /><br />
mitigation measures for biodiversity conservation. Sierra Minerals Holdings Ltd. will develop a strategic<br /><br />
response to biodiversity conservation and management to enable it to meet the wide range of<br /><br />
expectations of all stakeholders with interests in the company and its activities.<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 36<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the area of biodiversity conservation, SMHL will develop partnership with leading international<br /><br />
organizations and institutions through local institutions and NGOs who will provide a conservation<br /><br />
perspective on the challenges and opportunities raised by mining operations. An outline of strategic<br /><br />
biodiversity issues will be carried out with a concept note setting out a case for biodiversity conservation<br /><br />
and management. Key elements of the strategic thrust will be developed to help SMHL improve on its<br /><br />
biodiversity performance through:<br /><br />
 Identification of major threats, challenges and opportunities to the conservation and<br /><br />
management of biodiversity in the mining area;<br /><br />
 Identification and development of partnership for biodiversity conservation;<br /><br />
 Identification of cross cutting issues addressed by other community organizations; and<br /><br />
 Development of small projects on biodiversity conservation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As a signatory to this convention in 1995, Sierra Leone gathers and share information on greenhouse gas<br /><br />
emissions. The mining of bauxite requires enormous use of fossil fuel in the heavy equipment with<br /><br />
negative implications for the production of harmful emissions. Further, Aluminum is produced by the<br /><br />
electrolysis of alumina. Carbon dioxide is produced by the chemical reaction of oxygen in the carbon<br /><br />
lined steel pots in which alumina is produced. In this process, the perflouronated carbon compound<br /><br />
(PFC), tetraflouramethane (CF4) and hexaflouroethane C2F6) are the powerful greenhouse gases<br /><br />
generated.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project: An Environmental Monitoring Plan for air pollution has been prepared to<br /><br />
address air emission in the mining operations. In the area of climate change, SMHL will work with the<br /><br />
(IMMC) and other companies to increase energy efficiency across its production processes in the<br /><br />
following ways:<br /><br />
 Identification of climate related risks and opportunities and development of responses that will<br /><br />
be implemented and monitored using the existing Environmental Management Systems;<br /><br />
 Long-term modeling of likely changes in temperature and rainfall that could pose a hazard to<br /><br />
SMHL’s operations;<br /><br />
 Assessment of climate change impacts for both the operations and affected communities;<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 37<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Ensuring that SMHL’s operations will withstand increased frequency and magnitude of extreme<br /><br />
weather events;<br /><br />
 Joint venturing with nearby SRL to invest in biodiesel production and other agricultural<br /><br />
production as alternative energy resources; and<br /><br />
 Assess other risks that do not have an immediate risk but will harm mining operations in other<br /><br />
ways.<br /><br />
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(Ramsar<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Convention).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The objectives of the Ramsar Convention are to ensure the wise use of wetlands through stemming the<br /><br />
progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future, while recognizing their<br /><br />
fundamental ecological functions, and economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value.<br /><br />
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar) signed by Sierra Leone on 13 December 1999, became<br /><br />
effective on 13 April 2000. Signatory countries to the Ramsar Convention agree to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Include conservation of wetlands in land use planning throughout the country, including<br /><br />
the promotion of ‘wise use’ of wetlands;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Establish nature reserves within wetland areas;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Promote training in the fields of research, management; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Consult with other signatory countries about implementation of the convention<br /><br />
especially in areas of shared wetlands, shared water systems, and shared species.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As a party of the Ramsar Convention, Sierra Leone has designated two coastal wetlands as Ramsar Sites,<br /><br />
which are managed under Ramsar regulations.<br /><br />
Based on current information, no Ramsar-specific issues are associated with SMHL mining activities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Convention Concerning the Protection of Workers against Occupational Hazards in the<br /><br />
Working Environment due to Air Pollution, Noise, and Vibration (ILO No. 148).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sierra Leone became signatory to this convention in 1961. Participating parties may accept the<br /><br />
obligations of this convention separately in respect of air pollution, noise, and vibration. Measures<br /><br />
instituted to occupational hazards associated with these impacts, shall be prescribed by national laws<br /><br />
and regulations as outlined in the Factories Act of 1974.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The plan is applicable to all SMHL project related activities including camp and port facilities and<br /><br />
contractors. In all cases, Contractors will be required to submit their safety management plans to SMHL<br /><br />
for review and approval for use if is of a higher standard or exceed those provided by the Contractors.<br /><br />

Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) requirements went into effect<br /><br />
in Sierra Leone on 16 January 1995. CITES is a convention that provides for the elimination and/or<br /><br />
reduction in the trade of certain species, including endangered species. CITES provides a list of species<br /><br />
that are required for protection against trade. Species listed in CITES are also those for which trade is<br /><br />
strictly prohibited except in exceptional circumstances. The majority of the species listed in CITES are<br /><br />
also listed as endangered or threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and<br /><br />
Natural Resources (IUCN). CITES also includes species that are not necessarily threatened but for which<br /><br />
trade must be controlled to avoid the species becoming threatened or endangered. While a number of<br /><br />
species exist in the project area, there are no specific issues related to them.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This convention was signed by Sierra Leone in 1968.The African Union (AU) took into force the<br /><br />
protection of the natural environment. The main goals of the convention were to draw up a document<br /><br />
that enhanced environmental protection fostered the conservation and sustainable use of natural<br /><br />
resources, and brought together and coordinated policies in these fields. The states are to recognize the<br /><br />
importance of the natural environment, and create laws and regulations that protect it.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
World Health Organization (WHO 1999)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
World Health Organization (WHO 1999) has established Noise Level Guidelines for various Land Uses.<br /><br />
For residential dwellings or areas used for human habitation, WHO recommends that sound levels be no<br /><br />
higher than 50-55 dB for 16-hours of exposure during daytime hours and 45 dB for 8-hours of exposure<br /><br />
at night. WHO also recommends that persons should never be exposed to a maximum sound level<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Relevance to the Project<br /><br />
<br /><br />
An Environmental Monitoring Plan has been prepared specifically designed and implemented<br /><br />
for collecting data on ambient air, water quality, noise level including release of pollutants of<br /><br />
major concern and weather.<br /><br />
The Equator Principles (2003)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This is a set of guidelines signed by ten Banks from seven countries for assessing and managing<br /><br />
environmental and social risk in project financing. The EPs, is based on the International Finance<br /><br />
Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and the World Bank<br /><br />
Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines (EHS Guidelines). They are intended to serve as a<br /><br />
baseline and framework for implementation by each adopting institution on its own social and<br /><br />
environmental policies, principles and practices to its project financing activities.<br /><br />
The banks are pledging to apply this framework to all projects with a capital cost above US$ 50 million,<br /><br />
in all industries globally, and commit ‘not to provide loans directly to projects where the borrower will<br /><br />
not or is unable to comply with [the banks’] environmental and social policies and processes’.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In a first step, banks will categorize a project in one of three groups, A, B, or C, (group A comprises the<br /><br />
more risky projects) following the environmental and social screening criteria of the International<br /><br />
Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.<br /><br />
For all group A and B projects, sponsors are requested to carry out an Environmental Assessment (EA) in<br /><br />
line with the IFC Safeguard Policies, and World Bank and IFC Pollution Prevention and Abatement<br /><br />
Guidelines. For all group A projects and certain group B projects the sponsor will also prepare and<br /><br />
implement an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), consult with various stakeholders, and report on<br /><br />
the implementation of the EMP.<br /><br />
A number of quality controls are envisaged: compulsory independent expert reviews of EAs and EMPs<br /><br />
for group A projects; and independent expert review of compliance when judged necessary.<br /><br />

SMHL Response to these Policy Issues of the EQUATOR PRINCIPLES<br /><br />
Policy Issue 1.<br /><br />
The Banks categorize this project as a class A project and thus requires an Environmental and Social<br /><br />
Impact Assessment.<br /><br />
Response<br /><br />
This document presents the ESHIA for Vimetco smhl to obtain a EPA-SL license of compliance to operate<br /><br />
and manage its business.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It contains an assessment of all aspects to ensure that they are<br /><br />
<br /><br />
environmentally sound taking into consideration the following:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Evaluates a project’s potential impacts in both the area of impacts and its surroundings.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Evaluates project alternatives, mitigation measures and environmental management plans.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Examines project alternatives, identifies ways of improving project selection<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Proposes implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse<br /><br />
environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts; includes mitigating and managing<br /><br />
adverse environmental impacts throughout the implementation of the project.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Policy Issue 2<br /><br />
The borrower consults project-affected groups, a comprehensive program of stakeholder and local nongovernmental organizations about the project's environmental aspects and takes their views into<br /><br />
account.<br /><br />
Response<br /><br />
Public Consultation will be undertaken involving all stake holders to outline the mitigating, monitoring<br /><br />
and other measures require to prevent or minimize adverse effects and to enhance the project’s<br /><br />
beneficial effects. The report is summarily presented as part of this document.<br /><br />
Policy Issue 3<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Response<br /><br />
An Environmental Management Plan has been undertaken and the report is presented under separate<br /><br />
cover. The report is summarily presented as part of this document.<br /><br />
Policy Issue 4<br /><br />
Land acquisitions for mining are also likely to cause social disruption and economic loss for communities.<br /><br />
As such, it is important that disturbance and loss to the affected communities due to the project are<br /><br />
minimized through proper planning from a very early stage of the project.<br /><br />
Response<br /><br />
A base line socio economic survey is part of the scoping study to identify the degree of impact of the<br /><br />
project on the affected communities and explore the possibility of minimizing these adverse impacts. No<br /><br />
resettlement is envisaged in the existing project. Should there be any possible resettlement, a<br /><br />
Resettlement Plan for the affected people will be prepared and implemented. In addition, extensive<br /><br />
measures are currently taken to avoid displacement of people or other resettlement impacts.<br /><br />
The Equator Principles are aligned with the requirements of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),<br /><br />
which has established a set of Performance Standards that govern environmental considerations of<br /><br />
project financing. The IFC‟s Performance Standards have therefore been used as the yardstick against<br /><br />
which to measure compliance with the Equator Principles. A summary of the IFC Safeguard Policies is<br /><br />
presented below.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WORLD BANK/INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION: SAFEGUARD POLICIES and GUIDELINES.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The following IFC/World Bank Operational Policies (OP) and guidelines are relevant to the SMHL Project.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and World Health Organization (WHO)<br /><br />
Standards World Bank projects must address effects of the project on biodiversity. Biodiversity<br /><br />
is defined at three levels (ecosystem, species, and genetic) and is often interpreted as a measure<br /><br />
of biological complexity and variation within Project areas. Although there is little specific<br /><br />
regulatory guidance on methods of assessing and monitoring biodiversity, the concept is widely<br /><br />
interpreted, especially internationally, as a measure of ecosystem integrity and stability.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Key principles defined within both set of guidelines are as follows:<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 43<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Physical and economic dislocation should be avoided or minimized as much as possible.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unavoidable displacement should involve the preparation and implementation of a<br /><br />
Resettlement Action Plan, which demonstrates how international best practices have been/will<br /><br />
be met and defines a detailed approach and work plan to guide implementation, handover, and<br /><br />
monitoring and evaluation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Resettlement should be viewed as a sustainable development program designed to improve the<br /><br />
quality of life of those affected.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Legal standing is not synonymous with eligibility: even those people with no recognizable legal<br /><br />
right or claim to the land they are occupying should be considered eligible for resettlement<br /><br />
assistance.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Resettlement should be a consultative and participatory process: affected people should be<br /><br />
consulted thoroughly, participate in the definition of resettlement policies and procedures, and<br /><br />
in the end choose for themselves from among acceptable and clearly defined alternatives.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.30 – Involuntary Resettlement: International best practice for private sector-related<br /><br />
resettlement is commonly defined by the June 1990 World Bank Operational Directive 4.30. This<br /><br />
Operational Directive is applied around the world by private investors to govern involuntary<br /><br />
resettlement associated with natural resource and infrastructure development. The Directive<br /><br />
sets the benchmark against which such projects are gauged by international financial<br /><br />
institutions, both private and multi-lateral. Operational Directive 4.30 is internationally<br /><br />
acknowledged as one of the most comprehensive and efficient set of international standards<br /><br />
with respect to the protection of the rights of affected people.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The key principles of this policy are:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Physical and economic dislocation should be avoided or minimized where feasible;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unavoidable displacement should involve the preparation and implementation of a<br /><br />
resettlement plan. All involuntary resettlement should be conceived and executed as<br /><br />
development programs, with resettlers provided with sufficient investment resources and<br /><br />
opportunities to share in project benefits;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Displaced persons should be (i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior to<br /><br />
the actual move; (ii) assisted with the move and supported during the transition period in the<br /><br />
resettlement site; and (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their former living standards,<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
income earning capacity, and production levels, or at least to restore them. Particular attention<br /><br />
should be paid to the needs of the poorest groups to be resettled;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Community participation in planning and implementing resettlement should be encouraged.<br /><br />
Appropriate patterns of social organization should be established, and existing social and<br /><br />
cultural institutions of resettlers and their hosts should be supported and used to the greatest<br /><br />
extent possible;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Resettlers should be integrated socially and economically into host communities so that adverse<br /><br />
impacts on host communities are minimized; and Introduction 1 - 28<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Land, housing, infrastructure, and other compensation should be provided to the adversely<br /><br />
affected population. The absence of legal title to land should not be a bar to compensation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.01 – Environmental Assessment: All projects proposed for IFC financing require an<br /><br />
Environmental Assessment (EA) to ensure that they are environmentally and socially<br /><br />
sustainable. Instruments used to perform the EA may include an environmental impact<br /><br />
assessment, an environmental audit, a hazard or risk assessment, and an environmental action<br /><br />
plan. All IFC projects must be categorized. This policy also sets forth the minimum requirements<br /><br />
for public consultation and public disclosure for projects.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.04 – Natural Habitats: This policy affirms IFC’s commitment to promote and support<br /><br />
natural habitat conservation and improved land use, and the protection, maintenance, and<br /><br />
rehabilitation of natural habitats and their functions in its project financing. IFC does not<br /><br />
support projects that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.09 – Pest Management: This policy outlines IFC’s support of the use of biological or<br /><br />
environmental control methods instead of pesticides where there is a need for pest<br /><br />
management. Criteria for the use of pesticides, when required, are described.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.11 - Safeguarding Cultural Property: International best practices with respect to<br /><br />
safeguarding cultural property in IFC-financed projects includes sites having archaeological<br /><br />
(prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. Operational Policy<br /><br />
(OP) 4.11 specifies that the general policy of the World Bank is to assist in preserving cultural<br /><br />
properties and to seek to avoid their elimination.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OP 4.37 – Safety of Dams (September 1999 draft): IFC requires that dams be designed and<br /><br />
constructed by experienced and competent professionals. For dams that are over 15 meters<br /><br />
high; and dams between 10 and 15 meters that present special design complexities, IFC requires<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
reviews by a panel of independent experts, preparation of detailed plans, and periodic safety<br /><br />
inspections.<br /><br />
The policy covers mine tailing dams as well as water storage dams.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
OPH 11.03 – Management of Cultural Property: IFC projects must comply with World Bank’s<br /><br />
OPH 11.03, Cultural Property, as appropriate in a private sector context.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1995 – Open Pit Mining/Milling: The open pit mining and milling guidelines describe<br /><br />
requirements for tailing disposal, liquid effluent discharge, and air pollution control (including<br /><br />
workplace air quality compliance). In addition, other general requirements are included for<br /><br />
erosion and sediment control, development of a mine reclamation plan, sewage sludge and solid<br /><br />
<br /><br />
waste disposal management, workplace noise, confined space, hazardous material handling and<br /><br />
storage, sanitation, worker safety, employee training, and record-keeping and reporting.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1995 – World Bank Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines: These guidelines for mining<br /><br />
and milling at open pit mines include information for tailings disposal, liquid effluents, ambient<br /><br />
and workplace air quality, erosion and sediment control, mine reclamation, sewage sludge<br /><br />
disposal, solid waste disposal, workplace noise, work in confined spaces, hazardous material<br /><br />
handling and storage, general health and safety, training, and record keeping and reporting.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1998 – Disclosure Policy: IFC is open about its activities and welcomes input from affected<br /><br />
communities, interested members of the public, and business partners and will seek out<br /><br />
opportunities to explain its work to the widest possible audience. This policy was developed in<br /><br />
recognition of the importance of accountability and transparency in the development process.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1998 – General Environmental Guidelines: For financed projects in which no other specific<br /><br />
environmental guidelines have been developed, general environmental guidelines may be used.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
These guidelines emphasize pollution prevention, and are intended to minimize resource consumption,<br /><br />
including energy use, and to eliminate or reduce pollutants at the source. General Environmental<br /><br />
Guidelines include requirements for air emissions, liquid effluents, hazardous chemicals and wastes,<br /><br />
solid wastes, and ambient noise.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1999 – Child Forced Labor Statement: IFC will not support projects that use forced or harmful<br /><br />
child labor. Forced labor, as defined in the policy statement, consists of all work or service, not<br /><br />
voluntarily performed, that is exacted from an individual under threat of force or penalty.<br /><br />
Harmful child labor consists of employment of children that is economically exploitive, or is<br /><br />

likely to be hazardous to, or interfere with, the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s<br /><br />
health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2001 – Hazardous Materials Management Guidelines: Requirements of this guideline include<br /><br />
screening to determine characteristics and threshold quantities for hazardous materials,<br /><br />
development of a Hazardous Materials Management Program, and community involvement<br /><br />
and awareness.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2003 – IFC Environmental Guidelines for Occupational Health and Safety: This guideline covers<br /><br />
general aspects of occupational health and safety and would be supplemented, as needed, with<br /><br />
the appropriate national or international standards. Under this guideline, an Occupational<br /><br />
Health and Safety Management Systems are required. Such a system would require provisions<br /><br />
for ensuring an organizational framework to support the occupational health and safety<br /><br />
program, a hazard prevention program, performance monitoring, and evaluation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.3 Institutional Framework<br /><br />
Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources: The management of all mineral resources in Sierra Leone<br /><br />
is within the purview of the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources (MMR) headed by a Minister. The<br /><br />
Ministry has two divisions, Mines and Geological Surveys, both headed by Directors. The administrative<br /><br />
wing of the ministry is headed by a Permanent Secretary. The main responsibility of this Ministry is to<br /><br />
develop policies and programmes for the systematic and economic exploitation of the nation’s mineral<br /><br />
resources and to formulate regulations for the mining industry and related activities to ensure that the<br /><br />
nation derives maximum benefit from the mineral resources. The specific responsibilities include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Formulation of policies for mines and minerals;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mining negotiations;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Granting of concessions<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mining and minerals exploration<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Geological surveys;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Control of explosives for mining;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Inspection of mining machinery and mine sites;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Establishing relations with international mining and geological organizations and<br /><br />
agencies; and<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Collaboration with relevant national and international organizations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The National Minerals Agency: This is a new semi-autonomous government agency that is<br /><br />
established by an Act of Parliament (National Minerals Agency Act 2012). It is responsible for the<br /><br />
administration and regulation of the minerals sector. While the MMMR takes full responsibility of policy<br /><br />
implementation, the NMA handles the responsibility of policy implementation. It works closely with<br /><br />
other government agencies with the responsibilities in the mineral sector to support them in<br /><br />
implementing those policy areas from which they are responsible and impact upon the mineral sector. It<br /><br />
is also empowered to hire professionals and reward them according to their performance. The agency is<br /><br />
overseen by a Board of Directors, which helps to remove it from day-day politics.<br /><br />
Environment Protection Agency: This is the agency responsible for the monitoring and enforcing all<br /><br />
environmental regulations in Sierra Leone. Details of the roles and responsibilities are outlined in the<br /><br />
EPA Act presented above.<br /><br />
Other Institutions and line Ministries responsible for environmental management issues in Sierra Leone<br /><br />
include:<br /><br />
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security: To increase agricultural productivity, output,<br /><br />
rural income and employment while ensuring adequate protection of the environment.<br /><br />
Ministry of Lands, Housing, Country Planning and the Environment: Conserves and manages the<br /><br />
natural environment of the country; b. to address the issues of land acquisition, ownership and use.<br /><br />
Ministry of Transport and Communications: Addresses the issues related to transport and<br /><br />
communications. This ministry is involved in land degradation and the introduction of pollutants in the<br /><br />
natural environment, and as such mitigation measures are set for the ministry to implement in the<br /><br />
amelioration of pollution.<br /><br />
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development: Provides support to the MMMR to manage<br /><br />
certain development funds, monitor the reclamation of mined out areas and coordinate the Diamond<br /><br />
Area Community Development Fund (DACDF).<br /><br />
Ministry of Tourism and Culture: To protect the country’s heritage including monuments, cultural and<br /><br />
historical sites. The development of tourism often leads to infrastructural activities that deter sound<br /><br />

environmental management. This ministry is therefore charged with the responsibility of environmental<br /><br />
management in the Tourist industry.<br /><br />

Section 4 – Analyses of Alternatives<br /><br />
Analyses of alternatives constitute part of this ESIA. The purpose is to improve on project design,<br /><br />
construction and operation decision making based on feasible project alternatives (IFC, 2006). It will<br /><br />
provide the basis for identifying optimal project alternatives that are consistent with the goals of the<br /><br />
mining company, funding organization, the government, the mining community and the policy and<br /><br />
regulatory framework established for the mining industry.<br /><br />
Project alternatives that were considered for SMHL project include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Action alternative;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Alternative for location of staff accommodation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Bauxite processing location;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mine closure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Action Alternative<br /><br />
The adoption of the no-action alternative would mean that the project would remain in its current<br /><br />
condition with no mine-related development activity by SMHL. This scenario would mean that the<br /><br />
Environmental Management Plan and the community Development Action Plan that are prepared would<br /><br />
not be implemented. As such, the anticipated project benefits such as employment, foreign exchange<br /><br />
earnings, infrastructure development and community development initiatives would not improve in the<br /><br />
concession area and the country as a whole. This will result in the continuation of in migration into the<br /><br />
area and the resultant poor state of local economy, infrastructure and other public services.<br /><br />
The negative effect would also be seen in the physical environment where in the Taia River and its<br /><br />
tributaries will be continuously impacted by discharge of effluents thereby reducing the surface water<br /><br />
quality of the basin.<br /><br />
Location of staff Accommodation<br /><br />
The first plant site for bauxite mining including all mining activities was first around the Mokanji area.<br /><br />
Following the depletion of the Mokanji deposits in 1982, Sieromco relocated its operations to Gondama<br /><br />
(approximately 26 km south-east of Mokanji) and resumed mining in the Banta Mokelleh Chiefdom.<br /><br />
Sieromco mined the Gondama deposits and has since continued operations there.<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 50<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The two styles of accommodation provided for SMHL staff are located 20 – 40 miles away from the plant<br /><br />
site where most of the mining activities take place. The mining activities at the site do not require total<br /><br />
off-site accommodation especially for supervision work during the second and third shifts. The option<br /><br />
therefore is the relocation or expansion of both junior and senior staff accommodation closer to the<br /><br />
mine site. Proximity to the mine site would lead to the following benefits:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Reduction in travel time to work;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Increased work supervision at all times;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Proximity to the only Medical Hospital in the mining area;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decrease in the running cost of vehicles;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Extension of overtime work for certain staff categories;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Increase in the opportunity for the expansion of the Gbonge deposits and future expansion of<br /><br />
shipping facility closer to the four bauxite deposits.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ore Processing Plant<br /><br />
The original ore processing plant for the bauxite mine was located at Mokanji. The plant was abandoned<br /><br />
when mining relocated to the Gondama area in 1982. The existing processing plant is in a closer<br /><br />
proximity to the five major deposits and is located within a valley thereby reducing noise level that<br /><br />
impact on the surrounding village communities. For operational considerations, the tailings storage<br /><br />
facility was located as close as possible to the plant site to reduce cost of transportation of the slurry.<br /><br />
The potential for the existing facility to near its storage capacity is high considering mine life of SMHL<br /><br />
operations around the five deposits. Consideration should be given for an alternative storage facility in<br /><br />
the near future.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Two alternative methods for the disposal of the tailings generated at the site are proposed: a. Disposal<br /><br />
and storage of existing slurries in a min pit and reuse of the existing infrastructure; b. Construction of a<br /><br />
new facility within the same area close to the washing plant.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Tailings Disposal and Storage<br /><br />
This option will involve a construction of a mine pit into a tailings storage contained by perimeter<br /><br />
embankments. The slurries would be deposited in the pit as mining continues. Filling would continue for<br /><br />
less than a year and after a decanting period, revegetation would start followed by a full reclamation<br /><br />
work based on the mine reclamation plan.<br /><br />
With perimeter fencing, the area would be secured with no additional impacts.<br /><br />
The major disadvantages of this alternative would be related to short term mine plan as this operation<br /><br />
will concurrently go on with other mining operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Construction of a new storage facility<br /><br />
This option would require concurrent construction work and mining operations with little obstruction.<br /><br />
Construction work would however be more expensive as materials such as sand and gravel would have<br /><br />
to be transported from a distance outside the mining area. Also, the extent of land disturbance would<br /><br />
expect to be greater.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Preferred alternative for the two options would be controlled by key factors including costs, time of<br /><br />
construction, and availability of equipments, weather conditions and the expected life of the mine<br /><br />
operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mine Reclamation and closure alternatives<br /><br />
Mine reclamation and closure activities at SMHL operations are implemented to establish a beneficial<br /><br />
post-mining land use, in the case of this project it will consist primarily of agricultural lands. The key<br /><br />
activities will include re-grading disturbed areas to provide topographic relief that blends with the<br /><br />
surrounding areas. Some of the structural measures that will be put in place will include diversions,<br /><br />
backfilling and the construction of grass waterways. On the Gbonge Hills for example, cut and fills are<br /><br />
part of the extraction and reclamation activities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This option is requires millions of dollars in earth moving activities, and it cannot be considered as the<br /><br />
best option for the open pits. Backfilling of these pits with tailings slurries would be another feasible<br /><br />
option considering the life of the existing tailings facilities at the plant site.<br /><br />

Section Five – Environmental Baseline Conditions<br /><br />
This section presents the existing baseline conditions within the vicinity of the SMHL mine footprint<br /><br />
against which the predicted impacts of the projects are analysed. It is divided into two main sections:<br /><br />
Biophysical environment and socio-economic environment.<br /><br />
5.1 Biophysical Environment<br /><br />
5.1.1 Topography and Landforms<br /><br />
The topography of the project area is in the interior plains of the African continental mass approximately<br /><br />
80 to 100 km. wide. The elevation rises from the coast to the interior ranges between 50 and 300m<br /><br />
above sea level. Conspicuous topographic features include: a. residual hills, b. High and low river<br /><br />
Terraces, c .Lateritic Uplands, d. Undulating hills, e. Bottomlands and f. Inland Valley Swamps.<br /><br />
Residual Hills: The two residuals hills which are formed in a ridge like manner are the Mokanji and<br /><br />
Gbonge Hills. The Mokanji Hills which trends in a south-west direction has nearly flat summits with<br /><br />
elevations ranging from 45 to 100 meters. The colluvial foot-slopes occurring on the right hand of the<br /><br />
ridge were excessively mined out by former Sieromco. The Gbonge hills trends in a north-northwest<br /><br />
direction with outcrops on top of the ridge. The hills rise The hills rise above 152 meters above sea level<br /><br />
running from Senjehun on the Sewa river through Gbonge to Kangahun covering a distance of 64 km.<br /><br />
Terraces: These cover a significant portion of the mined out area especially between Mosenesie and<br /><br />
Gondama. They are generally related to the Taia River and its tributaries. They are relatively younger<br /><br />
than the uplands and become more pronounced as the river flows south.<br /><br />
Laterites: Laterites occur in various forms and are mostly hard, brown, porous with hydrated ferric<br /><br />
oxides and alumina and little silica. At higher elevations, they occur as crust of weathered rock masses<br /><br />
and at lower elevations they occur as duricrust.<br /><br />
Undulating Hills: Theses are toposequences that are nearly level with concave slopes near the<br /><br />
bottomlands. The bottomlands have shallow residual soils that develop from the weathering of bedrock<br /><br />
of the colluvial foot slopes.<br /><br />
Inland Valley Swamps: Inland valley swamps are found in the bottomlands and are characterized by<br /><br />
alluvial soils that are silty and poorly drained. They often tend to be narrow, long and flanked by<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
concave slopes on each side. Very often, there are small streams that are not deeply incised and dry up<br /><br />
in the dry season. The width of these swamps varies between 20 and 80 metres and the length of the<br /><br />
individual segments are usually between 3 and 5 km. Because of their low gradient and dense<br /><br />
vegetation, the swamp has a very low rate of discharge.<br /><br />
5.1.2 Climate and Weather<br /><br />
The climatic conditions like many areas in Sierra Leone are warm and hot, with marked rainy season and<br /><br />
dry season. The weather cycle is as follows: Harmattan, Dry but humid, Disturbance line squalls, Steady<br /><br />
rains, Disturbance line squalls, Dry but humid and Harmattan.<br /><br />
The harmattan period occurs from late December to late January. Usually after the middle of January,<br /><br />
the rainless and dry harmattan is replaced by a dry but humid period, which extends to the end of<br /><br />
March. This is caused by a retreat of the harmattan air masses to the north and penetration of humid<br /><br />
air from the Atlantic Ocean. The winds come mainly from the west. Often, heavy dew and fog occurs<br /><br />
during the night and early mornings.<br /><br />
From March to the end of June, showers become more frequent, usually accompanied by<br /><br />
thunderstorms. The storms travel east to west against the general wind direction. These disturbance<br /><br />
line storms are usually preceded by a squall of easterly wind; they increase in intensity and frequency to<br /><br />
the end of June. During this period, the weather is very changeable with high humidity. July, August,<br /><br />
and into September are periods of heavy and usually persistent rains. A pause of dry weather conditions<br /><br />
occurs in the rainy season during August with clear and humid weather.<br /><br />
Ninety percent of this rain falls during the rainy season from May to November, leaving the other five<br /><br />
months with no more than 250mm of rainfall. Rainfall data obtained from a nearby station<br /><br />
representative of the project area is presented in Table 8. The relative humidity ranges between 95 to<br /><br />
100 and the mean monthly temperature is almost constant varying from 25oC in August to 28oC in<br /><br />
March. The mean daily maximum temperature is at its lowest in August and highest in March. The<br /><br />
mean daily minimum is at its lowest in January and at its highest in May. A summary of the weather<br /><br />
conditions that are experienced in the project area is presented in Table 3.<br /><br />

51.3 Drainage and Hydrology<br /><br />
The Jong/Taia River constitutes the major drainage system in the project area. The Jong River drains<br /><br />
from the Sula Mountains and Kangari Hills in the north central of Sierra Leone. The main tributaries<br /><br />
include: Tikote, Kapui, Kwiva, Kati, Kpeyei, and Kwasi. They all flow in a southerly direction in a series of<br /><br />
zig-zag and meanders that reflect the lines of structural weaknesses. In nearly all cases, the drainage<br /><br />

basins do not follow the Crestline of the two ridges but are imprinted on lower ground on the inland<br /><br />
side of the ridges. Some of these basins have developed into inland valley swamps in their head and<br /><br />
middle waters.<br /><br />

From Mano Dasse to Mattru, the river flows southerly in a series of meanders crossing the MokanjiGbonge ridge in a steep sided valley. At Wubange, it meanders south and it is joined by the Tikote river<br /><br />
draining east from Gbangbama Hills; then by the Kwiva, which drains southwest from a flatland area<br /><br />
around Serabu and crosses the Gbonge ridge in a deep valley at Badui.<br /><br />
The Kapui rises in a dissected plain northeast of the Mokanji Hills. It crosses the hills in a deep straight<br /><br />
valley from Taninahun to Monghere, to receive the Kati, Kpeye and Kwesi tributaries in a wide flatland<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
and finally crosses at Yebeima in a series of incised meanders which continue westward to the Gbonge<br /><br />
confluence. The Yebei and Gbendeye rise from a flat ground close to the head of the Kwesi from where<br /><br />
they flow southwesterly across the strike ridge line at Gbangbatoke and Gbanbama respectively.<br /><br />
Some of these drainage patterns have developed into numerous inland valley swamps in their head and<br /><br />
middle waters. The swamps tend to be long and narrow and are generally flanked by convex slopes.<br /><br />
Actual widths of these swamps vary considerably, but the average is about 60m wide while the lengths<br /><br />
of individual segments are usually between 3 and 5km. Many of the swamps dry up entirely in the dry<br /><br />
season and those with low gradients become flooded in the wet season with a low rate of discharge.<br /><br />
The Taia river discharge has a mean flow rate of 668 m3sec in the rainy season with maximum rates<br /><br />
between 1000-1500 m3sec in August and September. During the dry season, the mean discharge falls to<br /><br />
89 m3sec but because of occasional storms there is generally an appreciable amount of water flow.<br /><br />
Runoff is moderate with a mean of 89mm and 15mm in the wet and dry season respectively (Jayakaran,<br /><br />
1987). Like many other areas in the country, there is an annual excess of precipitation over<br /><br />
Evapotranspiration demand. This lends itself to an analysis of a simple water budget accounting that will<br /><br />
provide an opportunity to monitor the water status in the project area throughout the year. Further, it<br /><br />
will provide numerical estimates of the amount of water surplus or water deficit and the periods of their<br /><br />
duration that will be used to monitor changes in the groundwater status area.<br /><br />
The hydrology follows the seasonal rainfall pattern as the flow of the rivers is influenced by the inflow<br /><br />
from their catchments. Annual peak flow, which is about 700m3/sec usually, occurs in August and<br /><br />
September. The flow starts to decrease in October when the rainfall is less and decreases to as low as<br /><br />
about 5m3/sec in April (ESCG, 1988).<br /><br />
During the rainy season there is an excess of precipitation over the reference Evapotranspiration that<br /><br />
cannot be stored as soil water and therefore roughly represents that amount of rainfall input that<br /><br />
becomes available for groundwater storage and runoff. The difference between annual precipitation<br /><br />
and water lost in deep percolation and or surface runoff (EP) is also of interest, since it represents the<br /><br />
actual use of water under local conditions imposed by the environment.<br /><br />
5.1.4 Geology<br /><br />
The geological formations (Precambrian age) found in the SMHL lease have a general NNW –SSE strike<br /><br />
and dipping in a West-South-West direction. Bauxite mineralization in the SMHL exploration license area<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
is a result of tropical weathering of alumina-rich facies rocks of the Kasila belt, which formed the<br /><br />
Mokanji, Gondama and Gbonge deposits. The bauxite in the project area is derived mainly from<br /><br />
anorthosites (Mokanji type with 53-56% Al203), leuco-gabbro (Gondama standard type with 52-54%<br /><br />
Al203), norite (Gondama 47-49% Al203) and hornblende/hypersthene gneisses (Mokanji West type with<br /><br />
45-48% Al203). These deposits do not form a continous ore body but rather, a chain of deposits with<br /><br />
topographically controlled breaks in echelon to one another (Mackenzie, 1961).<br /><br />
The petrology of the hypersthenes gneisses indicates a typical texture of the fresh rock and bauxite<br /><br />
laterites. Pale hard gibbsite material represents the plagioclase matrix, while red brown spongy spots<br /><br />
rich in limonite represents the hypersthenes (ibid). The bauxite is fine-grained, generally friable and<br /><br />
shows very little resistance to shock. The Gbonge anorthosite splits into two bands, probably becoming<br /><br />
discontinuous, irregular with highly deformed lenses. The anorthosite comprises alternances of layers<br /><br />
with almost pure plagioclase and layers rich in hypersthene. Quartzite with or without garnet and/or<br /><br />
magnetite occurrences are visible on both sides of the anorthosite belts.<br /><br />
Gabbros and leuco-gabbro occur mainly in the Gondama and Gbonge areas as massive and largely<br /><br />
undeveloped bodies with several elongated bands. The bands are highly deformed and have foliations.<br /><br />
Norites are more abundant than originally reported and bauxite derived from this type of rock is<br /><br />
massive, with low alumina and low silica. A long band of gabbros, leuco-gabbro and norite is also visible<br /><br />
in the western part of the project area, (Wunde IVA, IVB).<br /><br />
Texturally, the Mokanji depositse is fine-grained, generally friable and shows very little resistance to<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Gneiss bodies with hypersthene and hornblende generally surround the gabbros and anorthosite.<br /><br />
Structurally, the project area has a relatively simple tectonics generally comprising two fault systems<br /><br />
that are visible in southern portion around Konta and Gbonge. The first fault system has a NNW – SSE<br /><br />
orientation, delineating in the South the leuco-gabbro and norite formations (rich in bauxite) from<br /><br />
Gbonge Hills. The second fault system has WNW – ESE, developed between the Gbonge bauxite deposits<br /><br />
and Konta bauxite deposits. Generally, the bauxite deposits tend to have an iron-rich cap and pass down<br /><br />
to silicious bauxite.<br /><br />
5.1.5 Surface and Groundwater<br /><br />
Detailed surface and groundwater studies previously prepared and those in past ESHIA reports provide<br /><br />
the baseline information that facilitated the preparation of this impact assessment report. Tables 10 and<br /><br />
Table 11 present a summary of the analytical results obtained for the two periods.<br /><br />
Results for the 2003 study indicate that pH for the selected sampling sites ranged from 4.6 to 6.4. These<br /><br />
values are well below the WHO permissible limits. Electrical Conductivity results are within the threshold<br /><br />
limit recommended by WHO for potable water. Faecal Coliform bacteria were found in 60percent of the<br /><br />
samples while non-faecal coliforms were present in all the water samples. As such, drinking water from<br /><br />
the contaminated sample points was a health risk. Nine out of the 15 samples had dissolved iron far in<br /><br />
excess of WHO limits while manganese ions were below the 0.1mg/1 concentration. Concentrations of<br /><br />
nitrate/nitrogen in all samples were also below the threshold limit and all other chemical ions were<br /><br />
either zero or very minimal and within the permissible limits recommended by WHO.<br /><br />
The 2012 study indicate that Temperature of all the water samples measured was found to range from<br /><br />
26.1oC to 25.2oC with a mean value of 25.570C. These values are within the permissible limits for good<br /><br />
drinking water.<br /><br />
Water turbidity found to be above the WHO limits were at the following sources:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tailings out flow – 25-9 NTU<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Meseki (enfluent) – 10.2 NTU<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Makepi Village Taia river – 12.6 NTU<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tailings pond No. 5 – 5.2 NTU<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Conductivity values for all sample points were far below the tasted threshold. These values ranged<br /><br />
from 16.10 -224µ/cm. with the largest variability for Mokepi well. Generally, the TDS for all locations<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
was low with a higher content in the Mokepi well. Aluminum ranged from 0.0 to 0.2mg/l all the sources<br /><br />
are above the WHO limits, with the exception of Wunde (0.14mg/l).<br /><br />
According to WHO Limits. All the sources are above the WHO limits, except for Motuowo (0.05mg/l).<br /><br />
Iron concentration above WHO limits were found in the following points: Maseki (Elfluent, 0.44mg/l)<br /><br />
Mokepi (0.49mg/l Taia River). All the water points proved positive for E Coli with Moseki effluent and<br /><br />
Mokepi Hand dug well too numerous to count (TNTC).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All but three of the water sampling points proved positive for Faecal Coliform with the highest<br /><br />
compliance recorded for Mokepi well. Moseki effluent and Mokepi Taia River recorded the lowest<br /><br />
compliance. The measured physico-chemical parameters happen to be within WHO maximum<br /><br />
permissible levels, which implies that both the ground and surface water quality are not all that<br /><br />
polluted. The high content of TDS mostly as the discharge suggests that wastes are being added to the<br /><br />
Tailings dam from the washing plant. The Mokepi River shows high bacteria count indicating that the<br /><br />
river is receiving organic pollutant from the nearby villages.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The heavy metal contents Fe, indicates some potential threat to aquatic life, as they are above WHO<br /><br />
permissible limits. However, to sustain the ecological status of the Taia River, waste management<br /><br />
practice of waste re-use through the use of the dams should be encouraged.<br /><br />
5.1.6 Soils and Land Use Capability<br /><br />
The soils that occur in the project area are mainly derived from the metamorphic rocks of the Kasila<br /><br />
Group and on a minor scale from the igneous rock of the interior plains. The controlling soil forming<br /><br />
processes include:<br /><br />
 Weathering of primary minerals to form toxic horizons.<br /><br />
 Leaching of soluble substances and the subsequent formation of secondary minerals.<br /><br />
 Plinthization and segregation of iron and subsequent formation of hardened plinthite, duricrust<br /><br />
and laterite.<br /><br />
 Accumulation of surface soils to form epipedons (Odell et al, 1974).<br /><br />
As a result of the high rainfall and temperature, the silicate structures are broken with the resultant<br /><br />
release of silica, aluminum, iron and bases. Hardened laterites, plinthites and duricrust form mostly on<br /><br />
the uplands, though plinthite is often present in the poorly drained hydromorphic soils of the<br /><br />
bottomlands.<br /><br />

On the colluvial foot-slopes are soils that are generally shallow to moderately deep, very gravelly loams<br /><br />
to clays. On the hill-crests are residual soils that are well drained. Further down slope, the soils become<br /><br />
moderately shallow to moderately deep, gravelly and well drained.<br /><br />
Land capability evaluation was undertaken for this assessment to enhance the matching of crop<br /><br />
requirements in the reclamation processes using both the physical characteristics of the land and<br /><br />
climatic factors. Representative of typical soils of the land facets were evaluated for their agricultural<br /><br />
capability to produce various crops, using the following land attributes or qualities: Rooting space(r),<br /><br />
Soil fertility (f), Availability of moisture (n), Availability of oxygen (o), and resistance to erosion (e). The<br /><br />
FAO survey and land evaluation used in this report define 4 major landforms or facets within the lease<br /><br />
area which were grouped under land system 21 here in known as the Makondu land system<br /><br />
(UNDP/FAO, 1979).<br /><br />
Land quality was interpreted from the measurement of land factors taken in the field as follows:<br /><br />
 Measurement of effective soil depth (d) as a land factor defined rooting space (r) as a land<br /><br />
quality.<br /><br />
 Measurement of nutrient status (n) , salinity ( c), and soil reaction ( a) defined Soil Fertility (f), as<br /><br />
a land quality.<br /><br />
 Measurement of available water capacity ( x) and Climate type (z) both defined Availability of<br /><br />
moisture as a land quality as a land quality<br /><br />
 Measurement of drainage (w), flooding (fl) and permeability ( p) as land factors defined<br /><br />
availability of oxygen( o) as a land quality<br /><br />
 Measurement of slope steepness (s) and surface stones and rocks (y) both defined resistance to<br /><br />
erosion (e) as a land quality.<br /><br />
Eight crops were selected for the pre-mining evaluation scenario based on the potential for Agricultural<br /><br />
Land use. Table 6 shows the number of crops for which land suitability was systematically evaluated for<br /><br />
all the 4 land facets in the study area:<br /><br />
The suitability classes defined within the FAO land system are as follows:<br /><br />
S1: High to Moderate: land with no or moderate to slight limitations for the sustained cultivation of a<br /><br />
given crop. Relatively high yield and a good return on investment can be expected.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

S2:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
low: Land with moderately to severe limitations for the sustained cultivation of a given crop.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Adequate yields and a moderate return on investment can be expected.<br /><br />
S3: Very low: land with very severe limitations for the sustained cultivation of a given crop. Very low<br /><br />
yields and only a marginal return on investment can be expected.<br /><br />
N: Nil, i.e. land having limitations which appears as severe as to preclude any possibility of successful<br /><br />
sustained use of a given crop.<br /><br />
(Subscripts such as e, r, f, and m indicate the soil limitations that should be addressed by proper<br /><br />
management for the sustained economic production of a crop at suitability classes of S2 and S3).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Location of Sampling Points and Rationale for Selection.<br /><br />
In order to evaluate land capability in the mining lease area, 3 auger borings were made in swamps, and<br /><br />
2 pits were dug at locations indicated on map 3. The rationale for choosing this sampling point was to<br /><br />
assess the effectiveness of the reclamation process on land quality.<br /><br />
Site 2: The top –soil or overburden pile at the pile site of the on-going excavation at Gbonge hills. The<br /><br />
rationale for choosing this sampling point was to evaluate the process of top soil management and its<br /><br />
effects on soil fertility while piled up and waiting re-use for reclamation.<br /><br />
Site 3: An undisturbed coffee plantation with steep slope (24% slopes) in Jojohun. The rationale for<br /><br />
choosing this sampling point was to provide a reference soil for the steep upland soils of facet 3 by<br /><br />
which reclaimed land that were once on similar slopes before mining could be compared in terms of<br /><br />
their agricultural capability.<br /><br />
Site 4: Swamps in close proximity to the mine sites at Gbonge. The rationale for choosing this<br /><br />
sampling point was to assess whether the process of sedimentation ( predicted in the 2003 ESHIA<br /><br />
report for the resumption of mining by Vimetco by the Aqua Terra Consulting Firm) by runoff water<br /><br />
flowing downhill from ore excavation sites is active ( during the rainy season) and affecting soil fertility<br /><br />
and crop production in any way.<br /><br />

At each location the following soil factors were estimated as follows:<br /><br />
 Nutrient status: darkness/blackness of colour, thickness of A or black horizon, root<br /><br />
density and crop performance.<br /><br />
 Erosion hazard: presence and size of gullies, exposed crop/plant roots, slope percent,<br /><br />
and stoniness and Percent land cover.<br /><br />
 Thickness of the true soil: (A, E and B horizons) in auger borings, gully or soil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Analysis of the results: Results for the 5 sampling points indicated the following:<br /><br />
Land unaffected by mining activities in land facets 3 and 4 (see soil profile descriptions below), continue<br /><br />
to exhibit similar land capability rating for agricultural use as determined prior to mining. This was<br /><br />
evident in the morphology of the soils on the upland and low lands: The soils unaffected by mining were<br /><br />
dark in colour (10YR 2/1, black, moist), thick in their A or surface horizons and had high density of roots<br /><br />
from both crops and forest species. There was also 100% vegetative cover and absence of gullies on the<br /><br />
uplands and sedimentation in lowland at the foot of its slope. Crop performance (e.g. Coffee on the<br /><br />
upland and paddy rice in the swamps) was also very high. The current land uses on these soils appear to<br /><br />
support productive, sustainable and environmentally sound.<br /><br />

1. The top–soil overburden was lighter in colour (see soil colour below: value and chroma of 4/5) ,<br /><br />
with little to zero land cover and absence of structural aggregates compared to the reference<br /><br />
soils in 1 above. The process of overburden management as reported by the mining and<br /><br />
environmental staff of Vimetco seemed to promote soil nutrient loss through volatilization,<br /><br />
leaching , sheet or rill erosion, little or no addition of organic matter through composting ,<br /><br />
mulching or the planting and incorporation of leguminous cover crops. Since the reclamation<br /><br />
process is delayed until after ore excavation has been completed for a mining site, the<br /><br />
overburden is exposed to destructive climatic agents for as long as the excavation period lasted<br /><br />
which, in some cases went on for over 3-4 years. The team of consultants in Aqua Terra<br /><br />
consulting (2003), indicated in their ESIA report that there was need to “stabilize the soil<br /><br />
material” in order to prevent “severe erosion and landslide”. Evidence of low quality top soil<br /><br />
may be seen in the low tree crop cover and deep gullies that characterize almost all reclaimed<br /><br />
sites. Soil fertility (f) as a land capability quality for tree crops and annual crops is further<br /><br />
degraded by these processes reducing the agricultural capability of the reclaimed lands to as low<br /><br />
as S3 or N.<br /><br />

hills piled some 40 meters from the ore excavation zone.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. Soils in swamps at the foot slopes (Land facet 4) of active mining hills are at a high risk of being<br /><br />
buried by sediments from runoff during the rainy season. In their ESIA report on the impact of<br /><br />
mining operations on Topography and Soils in the Vimetco concession area, the team of<br /><br />
consultants in Aqua Terra consulting (2003) explained how “erosion and sedimentation “can<br /><br />
release “large quantities of sediments” with “surface sludge moving down slope”. Nine years<br /><br />
following this prediction, heavy sedimentation was evident on swamp soils proximal to the<br /><br />
Gbonge mining site. This was regarded an environmental flashpoint that should not be allowed<br /><br />
to expand into community swamps as it has the potential to reduce the agricultural capability of<br /><br />
the soils form S1 for paddy rice to as low as S3 or even N due to low fertility (f). Fertility decline<br /><br />
can be caused by the burial or mixing of the organically rich and dark A or surface horizons with<br /><br />
low nutrient inert materials from exposed soil parent materials or “not-soil” from the mining<br /><br />
hills.<br /><br />
The following summarizes the evaluation of soils on the land facets assessed within the mining area:<br /><br />
 Land that was unaffected by the mining operations of Vimetco maintained their agricultural<br /><br />
capability class in which they were originally classified.<br /><br />
 Poor topsoil management appears to have reduced the agricultural capability of the reclaimed<br /><br />
lands to as low as S3 or N, making tree crop establishment largely unsuccessful.<br /><br />
 Sedimentation in some parts of the lowland appears to reduce the agricultural capability of the<br /><br />
soils form S1 for paddy rice to as low as S3 or even N. This negative impact should be addressed<br /><br />
through appropriated cost effective mitigates.<br /><br />
Based on pre mining crop suitability, the following conclusions are made:<br /><br />

 That the colluvial soils of the plains were rated as having the highest crop suitability of S1 for<br /><br />
the cashew cash crop.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
That the soils of the Foot slope and Swamps were rated as having the highest crop suitability of<br /><br />
S1 for paddy rice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 The Cashew crop was the most suitable /adaptable for growing on all upland facets compared to<br /><br />
other tree crops evaluated.<br /><br />
 Soils at the top of isolated hills were rated as unsuitable (N) for all the arable crops evaluated<br /><br />
and rated as very low (S3) for growing tree crops. Erosion was cited as the most limiting factor<br /><br />
to producing crops on the soils of this land facet.<br /><br />
 Soils on the steep side slopes show suitability ranging from S1 to S3 for all tree and arable crops,<br /><br />
except rice.<br /><br />
 Four soil/land limitations to agricultural productivity, e, r, f, and m denoting, erosional hazard,<br /><br />
low soil volume for adequate root space, soil fertility and moisture availability, were identified<br /><br />
for soils in the lease area. These are the soil characteristics that need to be maintained or<br /><br />
improved for the land capability rating of the soils to increase. They can therefore serve as<br /><br />
indicators for monitoring mining impact on soil/land agricultural productivity.<br /><br />
 The limitation of erosion attributed to the upland poses a potential risk to sedimentation in the<br /><br />
low lands.<br /><br />
The above baselines on land capability of soils within the Vimetco concession area may now be used<br /><br />
to compare evaluate and predict mining impacts on soil productivity.<br /><br />

5.1.7 Terrestrial Biological Environment<br /><br />
Flora<br /><br />
Four main terrestrial biological units are found in the concession area: High moist Fragmented Forest,<br /><br />
Forest Re-growth, Upland Grasslands and swamps. The high moist fragmented forest is further divided<br /><br />
in to three units: the Moist Evergreen forest, Moist Semi- deciduous forests and Secondary or Forest<br /><br />
Regrowth.<br /><br />
Moist High Fragmented Forest: The moist evergreen is fragmented mostly found in clusters in the<br /><br />
lowlands, along streams and river courses. Around settlements are also found moist evergreen (rain)<br /><br />
forest interspersed with tree crops. But in the last few years, these have been drastically reduced as a<br /><br />
result of timber exploitation for war rehabilitation works. The original dominant tree species mainly<br /><br />
used as timber include: the mahogany Khaya anthotheca*,Entandrophragma utile*, E. angolensi*, E.<br /><br />
cylindricum’ Tetracarpidium conophorum, African cedar – Afzelia africana, African oak - Oldfieldia<br /><br />
africana*, Terminalia ivorensis, T. superba, Piptadeniastrum africanum, Daniellia thurifera,<br /><br />
Klainedoxa gabonensis, Brachystegia leonensis, Albizia ferruginea, Parkia biolor, Xylia evansii,<br /><br />
Ricinodendron heudelotii, Hannoa klaineana, Erythrophleum ivorense, Irvingia gabonensis*,<br /><br />
Mimusops heckelii, Cathormion altissimum, Amphimas pterocarpoides, Cynometra leonensis,<br /><br />
Tieghemella heckelii*, Heritiera utilis, Lophira procera, Sacoglottis gabonensis*, Triplochiton<br /><br />

<br /><br />
scleroxylon* and Parinari excelsa. Non-timber tree species include: Musanga cecrotodes, carapa<br /><br />
procera and myranthus arboresus.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Moist Semi-deciduous Forest: The moist semi-deciduous forest has similar characteristics to the<br /><br />
moist evergreen (rain) forest, but with a higher proportion of deciduous forest trees existing. They<br /><br />
are concentrated in the Gbonge Hills area south west of the concession area and relatively closer to<br /><br />
the coast. Before mining activities started, these forests found on hill tops were used mainly for<br /><br />
logging and farming activities. The original dominant tree species that existed here include:<br /><br />
Terminalia ivorensis, T. superb, Parkia bicolour, chlorophora regioa, Parinari excels,<br /><br />
Erythrophleum ivorense and many other evergreen species listed above.<br /><br />
Secondary forests are the dense forests found in clusters representing the last stages of succession into<br /><br />
mature forest after a long period of fallow. Their existence is due to their far away occurrences from<br /><br />
settlements and former sites of villages that are now of extinction. Common tree species found here<br /><br />
include: Musanga cecrotodes, carapa procera and myranthus arboresus. Typical timber species of<br /><br />
younger ages could be found including the Terminalia ivorensis, T. superb and Erythrophleum ivorense.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Forest Regrowth (Farm Bush): Forest Re-growth is commonly known as farm bush that is derived from<br /><br />
either of the above vegetation as a result of bush fallow cultivation. These farm bushes are found<br /><br />
scattered throughout the area and are of varying ages ranging between five to twelve years. One to two<br /><br />
years of fallow represents the early stages of regrowth consisting of very low shrubs, grasses and<br /><br />
remnants of the previous root crops. Typical species include: Lantana Camara, Cissus afzelli,<br /><br />
Manniophytum fulvum, Abrus precatorius, Smilax krausina and bovini. As the fallows tend to develop<br /><br />
further, pioneer forest species succeed the farm bushes and thickets if that area is no longer used for<br /><br />
farming for a period of time. Typical species include: Dicrostachys glomerata, Harungana<br /><br />
madagascariesis, Nauclea latifola, Alchorinear cordifolia and Trema guieenses and Elaesis guineensis.<br /><br />
Older fallows often have common tree species such as Anisophyllea laurina and Alchornaa cordofolia.<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Upland Grasslands: Upland grasslands are found mainly in mined out areas that have not been<br /><br />
revegetated and farm bushes that have been excessively been farmed and colonized by grassy<br /><br />
vegetation due to poor and shallow soils and frequent burning in the dry season. Common grass<br /><br />
species include: Andropogon gabonensis, Chasmodium Caudatum and Hyparrhenia rufa.<br /><br />
Chasmodium caudatum is a valuable grazing grass that does not widely occur but gradually been<br /><br />
replaced by Imperata Cylindrica and Pennisetum species.<br /><br />
In the mined out areas are exotic and indigenous flora in the process of regeneration. Common among<br /><br />
these are the fast growing Acacia leptocarpa and Paspalum plicatulum that were once used for<br /><br />
rehabilitation by SIEROMCO Mines. The advantage of using these exotic trees is their ability to fix<br /><br />
nitrogen in their nodules and their fire tolerant properties.<br /><br />
Inland Valley Swamps and Other Aquatic Vegetation: These are aquatic types of vegetation that<br /><br />
occur in seasonally or perennially flooded valley bottoms. They are drained by sluggish fresh water<br /><br />
streams that drain into the main rivers. Typical aquatic species include the raphia palm characterized by<br /><br />
stilt roots and buttresses, mitragyna stipulosa and aquatic grasses and other water tolerant species<br /><br />
which creep as undergrowth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In addition to inland valley swamps are other wetlands encountered in the mining area. These are either<br /><br />
artificially constructed or partially destroyed as a result of mining activities. They are either ponds that<br /><br />
are in use or abandoned containing biodiversity with minor threats from damming and contamination.<br /><br />
Gallery forest: Gallery forest is found along the margins of the Taia River and other major streams,<br /><br />
consisting of a dense canopy of trees.<br /><br />
Gallery forest tends to be scanty along the main streams and minor rivers partly due to removal of<br /><br />
vegetation along the river margins to make way for farming activities.<br /><br />
5.1.8 Threats to Vegetation<br /><br />
Because of the current threat of deforestation on Sierra Leone’s biological resources, studies have been<br /><br />
carried out on over a thousand under-exploited economic plants (Cole & Macfoy, 1992; Turay; 1997;).<br /><br />
Five main categories of uses have been mentioned with over 40% of these as medicinal, 21% as food<br /><br />
and cash crops, 20% as timber trees and cottage industries and 15% as ornamentals used in horticulture.<br /><br />
This list has been compiled and reproduced in Annex Table A-2.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Fauna<br /><br />
The mine site is located in an area that has been previously surveyed and reported in other studies<br /><br />
(I.M.C. Mackay & Schnellman 1995; Knight Piesold Consulting 2003; Aqua Terra Consulting 2003). Many<br /><br />
of the large birds and mammals are not present in large numbers due to human induced impacts. No<br /><br />
detailed field studies were undertaken but reference was made to these previous studies with list of<br /><br />
fauna species used during field survey for confirmation by local residents on the past and current<br /><br />
presence of all species. This list was further used to determine the conservation status in terms of the<br /><br />
following IUCN status:<br /><br />
EX (Extinct): No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.<br /><br />
EW (Extinct in the wild): Known only to survive in captivity or as naturalized populations well outside its<br /><br />
previous range.<br /><br />
CR (Critically Endangered): The species is eminent risk of extinction in the wild.<br /><br />
EN (Endangered): The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.<br /><br />
VU (Vulnerable): The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.<br /><br />
NT (Near Threatened): The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorize it as risking<br /><br />
extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.<br /><br />
LC (Least Concern): There are no current identifiable risks to the species.<br /><br />
DD (Data Deficient): There is inadequate information to make assessment of the risks to this species.<br /><br />
Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. The Species assessed using this system have<br /><br />
the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The Convention of International Trade in endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The following is a summary of the description of the fauna that exist in the concession area as<br /><br />
categorized above.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Primates: A total of 9 primates are said to have existed and recorded in and around the mining area.<br /><br />
Four of these are listed as Endangered and Lower risk concern. They include:, Olive and Green monkey,<br /><br />
the western Baboon, Olive Baboon, the Gorrila, Chimpazee, Colobus monkey, Black and white monkey<br /><br />
and the Patas. The widespread of vegetation removal due to mining and farming makes it difficult for<br /><br />
most of these species to be visible. The widespread trade in bush meat and the hunting of animals to be<br /><br />
used as pets are also responsible for the gradual dwindling of these primates.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Rodents: Rodents make up by far the largest order of mammals. Depending on the type of habitats, they<br /><br />
can live in large numbers, and are smaller in sizes though often weighing up to 25kg. The most popular<br /><br />
of these include: the ground squirrel, the flying squirrel, cane rats and mouse of different order and<br /><br />
genus. They are more widely distributed in young farm bushes and grassy vegetation. The scaly tailed<br /><br />
squirrel is found around old and abandoned settlements and very thick and moist shrubs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Ungulates: Ungulates are even-toed animals such as antelopes whose weight is borne about equally by<br /><br />
the third and fourth toes. They are of great economic value to humans all over the world. They are<br /><br />
preferred game species with very high prices in the mining towns and villages. Eight of these are<br /><br />
commonly found existing in the area. These include duikers of the common duiker, maxwell’s duiker,<br /><br />
yellow-backed duiker, bongo, royal duiker, black duiker and the bushbuck and Jetinks duiker. Their<br /><br />
status has been affected by the extensive alteration of the natural habitat combined with hunting and<br /><br />
trapping. Most of the mining area has been severely overhunted and the antelope population is critically<br /><br />
low.<br /><br />
Lagamorphs (Hares & Rabbits): The two families that exist include: hare/rabbits and Pikas that<br /><br />
resemble rodents but classed as super-families and thus classed under separate order. They have four in<br /><br />
scissors and an upper jaw instead of two. Common are the Lepus microtis and hares.<br /><br />
Hedge Hogs/Shrews and Moles: These are recognized by their spines though they look like rats. The<br /><br />
most common is the four-toed hedgehog. The African Pygmy hedge hog for example, is a nocturnal<br /><br />
animal that begins foraging from dusk to dawn. It has a lifespan of about two to three years in the wild.<br /><br />
Shrews are insectivorous mammals that seldom resemble mice and moles and are stout bodied<br /><br />
burrowers. Common among these are the tiny musk shrew and the mouse-tailed shrew.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Amphibians/Bats/Reptiles: No threatened amphibians are recorded in the area. They are mostly found<br /><br />
to exist in the mine area in the narrow corridors of the Taia river and other main streams, open<br /><br />
woodlands and swamps. Common among these include: the Buffalo toad, banana frog, lime red frog,<br /><br />
mottled squeaker, long-tailed running frog and the river frog.<br /><br />
Bats are animals whose forelimbs are developed as wings making them the only mammals capable of<br /><br />
flying. Common among them are fruit bats, Light-winged Lesser House Bat, Gland-tailed Free-tailed Bat,<br /><br />
Little Free-tailed Bat, Sierra Leone Free-tailed Bat, and the Dwarf Free-tailed Bat. Some of these bats are<br /><br />
identified as a source of protein for the local residents.<br /><br />
Throughout the area are numerous reptiles ranging from lizards to snakes. The common agama (Gecko)<br /><br />
that is red headed is the most common lizard. It can be found climbing rocks and walls preying on<br /><br />
insects. The dwarf African crocodile is said to be common in the Taia river banks. It is very slow,<br /><br />
nocturnal and digs out burrows to hide and rest in the day. Very numerous snakes are found to exist in<br /><br />
the area. They range in size from small snakes like the red spitting cobra to the King cobra. Other<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
common snakes include the green and yellow mamba, the adder, viper, yellow bellied house snake and<br /><br />
the python. A list of these venomous snakes is produced in the Annex Table A.<br /><br />
Birds: Of the 626 birds recorded in Sierra Leone, 23 are said to be of global concern, 12 are globally<br /><br />
threatened. Moreover, 437 of this total are recorded to be residents in Sierra Leone and 137 are regular<br /><br />
visitors. Ten sites are established as important Bird Area (IBA) of which 3 are unprotected. There is a<br /><br />
high degree of endemism, but relatively few are threatened. Subsistence hunting of large birds and<br /><br />
game birds has led to a general decline in bird populations. The mining area does not fall within any of<br /><br />
the above categories. However there exist many bird species that are characteristic of the coastal and<br /><br />
interior plain area of south west of the country.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.2 Socio-economic Environment<br /><br />
5.2.1 Demography<br /><br />
The population of Moyamba District using the last 2004 census figure is 260,910. The total density is<br /><br />
estimated to be 60 persons per square km. This is almost the average figure for the mining population<br /><br />
that concentrates along the main roads in towns like Mokanji, Moriba Town, Mogwemo and<br /><br />
Gbangbatoke. The population is unevenly dispersed among the chiefdoms within the mining<br /><br />
community. As expected, there is a greater concentration of population in villages around mining sites<br /><br />
and chiefdom headquarters. The civil conflict ten years ago and its adverse impacts on all types of<br /><br />
economic activities have certainly caused the population to migrate from some chiefdom.<br /><br />
Another common feature of the population is its youthfulness with over 40% aged less than 15 years.<br /><br />
There is a relative shift in the age pattern of fertility with an earlier onset of reproduction, and an earlier<br /><br />
peak of fertility, and a high ratio of performance in the younger ages for the entire project area. The<br /><br />
reasons that seem to account for these include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the relatively low status of women in the communities;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the relatively younger population;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
earlier onset of child bearing, especially through teenage pregnancies;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
high dropout rates from schools which give younger women little alternatives than to start their<br /><br />
families; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
relative absence of family planning methods.<br /><br />

Public Health is within the purview of the Peripheral Health Unit (PHU) of the Ministry of Health and<br /><br />
Sanitation. It is the delivery point for primary health care with three main categories. The Community<br /><br />
Health Centre (CHC) found in almost all chiefdom headquarters carries out health prevention measures,<br /><br />
cures, promotes health activities. It is also in charge of overseeing the other PHUs in the area. All of the<br /><br />
five chiefdoms have at least one community Health Centre. Community Health Posts perform similar<br /><br />
functions to CHCs but have fewer facilities and often refer patients to health centres. Maternal and Child<br /><br />
Health Posts (MCHP) are the first level of contact on the ground and are found in most villages in all<br /><br />
chiefdoms. All these health units refer difficult cases and emergencies to Serabu Hospital, which is the<br /><br />
general hospital with medical, surgical, laboratory, radiological and other diagnostic and treatment<br /><br />
services.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Maternal health has remained poor. Although accurate statistics for the chiefdoms as a whole are not<br /><br />
available, it is estimated that the maternal mortality ratio high. Contributory factors are cultural<br /><br />
practices such as gender power imbalances, the low level of education among girls, and poor access to<br /><br />
skilled birth attendance.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
One recent innovation in the public health sector is the introduction of “Free Health Care Medical<br /><br />
Insurance” that was launched in 2010. It is a system of free health care for pregnant and breast feeding<br /><br />
<br /><br />

women and children under five funded by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA),<br /><br />
The World Bank and the Department for International Development (DFID).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Malaria is the main reason why outpatients consult in local health centers. It is responsible for about 30<br /><br />
percent of all hospital attendances and is listed first in the top ten causes of mortality in all age groups<br /><br />
under the age of 16 years. People are however willing to use bed nets which can be treated with<br /><br />
permethrin to control mosquitoes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Children under five are predisposed to outbreaks of immunizable diseases such as measles, tetanus and<br /><br />
whooping cough since there is both low immunization coverage and poor mother-child health<br /><br />
monitoring in the area. The overall immunization coverage has however increased over the years. Poor<br /><br />
nutrition and inadequate growth monitoring may lead to malnutrition and delayed mental and physical<br /><br />
development among children under five.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The reproductive health of adolescents and youth also continues to be a major health challenge.<br /><br />
Contributory factors include forced marriages, and poor access to information and youth-friendly<br /><br />
reproductive health services. High levels of sexual debut, teenage pregnancy, school drop-outs and<br /><br />
resultant low level of education are manifestations of this health challenge for the girl child. The<br /><br />
communities also have their own stock of indigenous knowledge about the treatment of a variety of<br /><br />
illnesses such as malaria, fever, general pains or sicknesses, post-natal sickness, poisoning, etc.<br /><br />
5.2.3 Water Supply<br /><br />
The main sources of drinking and domestic water are from shallow wells, streams, swamps and the<br /><br />
ponds that are constructed by the mining company. Even though some of these wells were constructed<br /><br />
by NGOs over the years, they are not regularly treated or monitored to ascertain the quality of water.<br /><br />
Without the provision of various water sources by SMHL, access to water for many in the community is<br /><br />
lacking. There are more much evidence of water pollution as a result of the bauxite mining and<br /><br />
processing operations. Sanitation facilities are limited especially in the smaller settlements where often<br /><br />
no pit latrines exist.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Water sources in the mining community are from rivers, streams and wells with some fitted with hand<br /><br />
pumps. The Taia River and its tributaries serve as a permanent and valuable source of water which is<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 77<br /><br />
<br /><br />
used mainly for mining, fishing, and for human consumption. Apart from those noted above, other<br /><br />
perennial surface-water sources available in the area are the reservoirs and ponds that have been<br /><br />
constructed for mining which were abandoned a long time ago by the then SIEROMCO Minerals. The<br /><br />
main water body that constitutes ground water occurrences is the Kasila series, the Taia river terraces<br /><br />
and the Inland Valley swamps. The Kasila is usually shallow in the wet season rising to about 0.5m below<br /><br />
the ground surface in some areas. Generally, ground water level decreases with seasonal fluctuation in<br /><br />
precipitation. In the dry season, ground water drops linearly with no recharge from rainfall.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ground water analyses have been previously undertaken in villages around project sites from existing<br /><br />
hand dug wells. The results indicate that ground water quality characteristics are controlled by<br /><br />
fluctuations in water levels in the systems (ESCG), 1990; IMC Mackay and Schnellman, 1997; Aqua Terra<br /><br />
Consulting, 2004). In the wet season, water from most of the wells is often clean with pleasant taste. In<br /><br />
the dry season on the other hand, some of the water in the wells become dry or coloured with<br /><br />
unpleasant taste. The laterites become highly soluble in the wet season making the water acidic. The<br /><br />
study by Aqua Terra Consulting indicates that pH for the selected water points ranged from 4.6 – 6.4<br /><br />
with a mean value of 5.6. These values are outside permissible limits of 6.5 – 8.5 as recommended by<br /><br />
World Health Organization (WHO). All the points had turbidity value of 5NTU, which is the maximum<br /><br />
threshold for clear water as recommended by WHO. Faecal coli form bacteria were discovered in 60 of<br /><br />
the samples. As such, drinking water from these points is a health risk.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.2.4 Education<br /><br />
The level of education in the mining community is relatively low. There are less than 20 Secondary<br /><br />
schools in the entire concession area, even though few primary schools exist. Of these, Lower Banta has<br /><br />
the largest number of all the schools, followed by Bumpe and Dasse respectively. Overall, the number of<br /><br />
students enrolled at both primary and secondary schools has drastically increased in the last three to<br /><br />
four years. This has led to the increase in the density of classes that is far beyond average. The increase<br /><br />
is affecting the efficiency and capacity of the educational system especially at the primary stage.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The GOSL and a number of NGOs are providing educational services in terms of construction of<br /><br />
buildings, provision of teaching and learning materials. However, certain factors are standing the way of<br /><br />
improving the educational processes within the chiefdoms including: overcrowding classrooms; poor<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 78<br /><br />
<br /><br />
quality of school buildings; poor spatial distribution of schools; inadequacy of school buildings; low<br /><br />
wages for teachers; high failure rates of school children in public exams; and a large number of overaged children.<br /><br />
5.2.5. Land and Water Resources<br /><br />
The right to land in the area is vested in the community. Ownership is inherited for specific lineages or<br /><br />
household with the eldest male administering the land. At community level, authority over land is<br /><br />
vested in the chiefs and the overall power over land in the entire chiefdom is vested in the paramount<br /><br />
Chief. Land acquisition for mining has a direct adverse impact on the livelihood especially when<br /><br />
agriculture is the main livelihood source for the community. Though land shortage is not a major<br /><br />
concern raised by the community, the issue of proper and adequate rehabilitation of mined out areas is<br /><br />
raised as a matter of concern. The communities argued that there would be adequate land for farming if<br /><br />
the mined out areas could be adequately rehabilitated with fertile top soil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Other constraints to land resource utilization in the farming communities include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Low capital base and high costs of inputs;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lack of mechanization as a result of terrain configuration;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Low level of management skills;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Low level of incentives for farmers such as lack of cooperatives that can assist farmers in bulk<br /><br />
purchasing and access to attractive markets.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
.<br /><br />
5.2.6. Transport and Communications<br /><br />
Apart from the principal Mokanji – Gbangbatoke – Nitti Port road, which is regularly maintained by<br /><br />
SMHL, the road network other than the feeder haulage roads in the mining area is poorly maintained.<br /><br />
Feeder roads to most of the villages are hardly ever graded, although SMHL has also done considerable<br /><br />
work in maintaining the road to Gbonge from Gondama. Modes of transport are limited especially<br /><br />
during the wet season.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.2.7. Social and Political Organizations<br /><br />
There is a strong social and political influence within the communities ranging from strong community<br /><br />
spirit, special bonds, civic bonds, networks, extended friendships and trust to enable communities to<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 79<br /><br />
<br /><br />
act together effectively to pursue common objectives. There is a low level of social ties that influences<br /><br />
community development especially in areas of decision making. The ability to mobilize resources is<br /><br />
generally low in all four chiefdoms, so also is their capacity for financial management and revenue<br /><br />
generation. Based on membership, the predominant social institutions are highly skewed towards men.<br /><br />
The members of a group interviewed were usually heads of households and therefore almost always<br /><br />
males; the number of women members remains negligible. The extent to which women and, to a lesser<br /><br />
degree, youth, can draw on this form of social capital is, therefore, limited. The wide variety of<br /><br />
community or village level institutions and organizations that may have impact on community<br /><br />
development programmes in the area can be divided into: Governmental, Indigenous and NonGovernmental Organizations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Government Institutions include: Associations established to promote specific development activities<br /><br />
under the supervision of extension officers, e.g. Project Management Committees (PMC); Village<br /><br />
Development Committees; Ward Development Committees (WDC); Local level Party Organizations set<br /><br />
up to organize elections or act as channels of government based on political patronage.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Indigenous Organizations include: Traditional Authorities- chiefs and elders; Groups set up to organize<br /><br />
mutual support activities; Producers’ Unions; Women’s Associations; Work Groups; Social Clubs of<br /><br />
young men and women set up to achieve social activities; Church/Mosque Organizations with strong<br /><br />
political and social structures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non-Governmental Organizations are the key actors in the community development process. They<br /><br />
operate in all the communities by providing them with schools, wells and pumps, clinics, micro-credits,<br /><br />
etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Local Council is a recent innovation in public administration after its demise in the early 1970’s. As an<br /><br />
entity, they are bedeviled by the lack of adequate logistical support and capacity to effect the desired<br /><br />
change in the communities. Community’s awareness for development in the area id therefore limited.<br /><br />
5.2.8. Land Tenure<br /><br />
Land acquisition for mining has a direct adverse impact on the livelihood especially when agriculture is<br /><br />
the main livelihood source for the community. Though land shortage is not a major concern raised by<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 80<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the community, the issue of proper and adequate rehabilitation of mined out areas is raised as a matter<br /><br />
of concern. The communities often argue that there would be adequate land for farming if the already<br /><br />
mined out areas could be adequately rehabilitated with fertile top soil. Community engagement with all<br /><br />
stakeholders will therefore constitute the cornerstone to establishing and maintaining long term<br /><br />
support for the implementation of the MRCP.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.2.9. Economic Activities<br /><br />
Cash cropping and subsistence farming are the two major systems of agriculture. The main cash crops<br /><br />
grown today are oil palm, coffee and whilst there has recently been extensive planting of cassava for<br /><br />
garri production. The main subsistence food crops grown are rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, maize,<br /><br />
beans, groundnuts, cocoyam, millet, sorghum, peas, sesame, and yams. A range of vegetables are grown<br /><br />
throughout the year including tomatoes, spring onions, pepper, eggplants and cucumber.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Trees planted on reclaimed mined out lands are used for a wide range of reasons including: a source of<br /><br />
fuel and building materials and, to improve soil moisture and fertility. The main fruit trees are jackfruit,<br /><br />
avocado, mango, oranges and pawpaw.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
While socio-economic and cultural changes are impacting upon the community development with<br /><br />
evidence of a growing appreciation of gender concerns, the differences in gender roles and rights<br /><br />
remain intact and distinct in all the chiefdoms. The farming production economy, which is prevalent in<br /><br />
most parts of the chiefdoms, typifies this - a family enterprise with clearly defined gender roles with<br /><br />
men as the key decision-makers, except for women-headed households who often get engaged in petty<br /><br />
trading. Men control about 70% of the family expenditure with women controlling about a 25% and<br /><br />
other members of the family, mainly sons, control the rest. Women still control only a limited range of<br /><br />
activities and have restricted access to decision-making in the community. They lack decision-making<br /><br />
power on land tenure issues and rarely own productive resources such as land or tree crops. They have<br /><br />
limited sources of income compounded by the inability to access markets for their products. Other<br /><br />
challenges faced by women include constrained access to information and a paucity of resources to<br /><br />
address issues such as sanitation in the homestead.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 81<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Besides people working in the mines, about 90% of the households in the community are farmers, while<br /><br />
many other people undertake other occupations such as petty trading, fishing and bike taxi driving.<br /><br />
Based on the 2010 survey, the average sustainable land holding in the chiefdoms is 0.90 ha per<br /><br />
household with an annual agricultural income of about $350. Those engaged in fishing have a higher<br /><br />
income of about $1250 per year. The important categories of expenditure are education,<br /><br />
food/household essentials, health care, farming, taxes, transport, credit and home building. The costs<br /><br />
that are considered to impose hardships on a family are,- education, acquiring a piece of land for<br /><br />
housing, and health services. People are able to save during the productive seasons of November to<br /><br />
February. However, savings are inadequate to address needs during the wet season months of June, to<br /><br />
September when incomes are low and expenditures high.<br /><br />

There are some variations in the ways the population derives its income. The larger settlements of<br /><br />
Gbangbatoke, Mokanji, Gbonge and Mosenesie and Walihun, carry higher populations derive their<br /><br />
incomes from either government or NGOs due to the level of education attained by these people.<br /><br />
Employment with the two mining companies operating in the area offers another source of income for<br /><br />
some of the local community although this is limited by the low education and skills level available.<br /><br />
Company employment policy has a preference for locals in the recruitment of unskilled jobs.<br /><br />

The community is further constrained in exploiting more fully its financial capital as it lacks access to<br /><br />
credit facilities. Financial services, such as banking and savings services, are under-developed or<br /><br />
unavailable. For instance, there are no micro-credit lending institutions to facilitate the expansion of<br /><br />
micro-enterprise development.<br /><br />
5.2.10. SURFACE LAND OWNERSHIP<br /><br />
Surface land ownership in the mining lease area and other parts of the provinces is vested in indigenous<br /><br />
families. Landowners generally use surface lands for permanent occupation in the form of physical<br /><br />
structures, tree plantations and temporary occupation in the form of shifting cultivation and cattle<br /><br />
grazing.<br /><br />
The agreement with the GOSL through the Mining Agreement, establishes SMHL’s right to occupy and<br /><br />
utilize permanently and temporarily within its mining lease such parts of the surface land, whether<br /><br />
government owned or otherwise, as may be reasonably required for accessory works and installations<br /><br />
that are necessary or useful for its operations, and such part of the surface as may be required for its<br /><br />
prospecting and mining operations.<br /><br />
SMHL pays annually, in advance, a surface rent under the mining lease for all land occupied or used.<br /><br />
This amount will be distributed among the Paramount Chiefs, Landowners and Chiefdom<br /><br />
Administration.<br /><br />
Through the Ministry of Agriculture, with its listing of fees for economic and subsistence crops, SMHL<br /><br />
makes satisfactory arrangements for payment of a fair and reasonable compensation for damage to any<br /><br />
crops, trees, farms, Permanent and temporary structures or works that occur as a result of prospecting<br /><br />
and or mining operations.<br /><br />

Section SIX – Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures<br /><br />
This section discusses the existing and potential environmental and social impacts that are associated<br /><br />
with SMHL operations and the mitigation measures required to minimize these impacts to acceptable<br /><br />
levels. The section only deals with the existing project operations and not past activities and impacts<br /><br />
that were conducted by previous studies or future mining operations other than the current deposits<br /><br />
that are being mined.<br /><br />
6.1. Biophysical Environment<br /><br />
6.1.1 Topography<br /><br />
Mining activities at SMHL operational areas involve the removal of vegetation and the opening up of<br /><br />
mine panels. Vegetation is also removed in areas that are used for the stockpiling of overburden and<br /><br />
ore. Topsoil removal and subsequent stripping of the overburden is done with the use of bulldozers and<br /><br />
excavators with the resultant alteration of the topography and landforms. Mining progresses further<br /><br />
with backfilling of mine panels that are levelled to match the pre-existing landscape as much as possible.<br /><br />
Other concurrent activities involve haulage and other road rehabilitation works undertaken especially<br /><br />
during the wet season.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A total of about 1300 acres of land area has been disturbed as a result of this activity and the impact is<br /><br />
expected to last forever though with less severity. Under the current mining methods, the significant<br /><br />
rating scale for this activity is moderate. The use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers, excavators and<br /><br />
trucks utilized during the mine’s operation is also resulting in soil compaction in the wet season often<br /><br />
beyond permeability which can lead to the creation of pools after periods of heavy rainfall.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The major mitigation measure for the above impacts is the reclamation of mined out areas to a near<br /><br />
original habitat. The Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan (MRCP) that has been prepared for SMHL that<br /><br />
details the major activities involved in grading and levelling of the local topography that is currently<br /><br />
been disturbed. A summary of this plan is presented under a separate chapter of this report.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The overburden materials and the ore stockpiles are often susceptible to erosion and can lead to<br /><br />
sedimentation of waterways. To mitigate this impact, detention storages should be constructed to<br /><br />
collect open pit water and runoff drainage to ensure that the receiving environment water quality is<br /><br />
achieved prior to discharge.<br /><br />

The use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers, excavators and trucks utilized during the mine’s<br /><br />
operation is also resulting in soil compaction in the wet season often beyond permeability which can<br /><br />
lead to the creation of pools after periods of heavy rainfall.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To mitigate the impact of compaction in the wet season, designated routes should be utilized for the<br /><br />
movement of heavy vehicles and machinery and the transportation of ore and other materials from the<br /><br />
deposit sites. The implementation of these measures will eventually be not much of a concern for the<br /><br />
project.<br /><br />
6.1.2 Air Quality<br /><br />
The common operations that impact on air quality include land clearing, excavation, earth moving, and<br /><br />
storage of materials, handling and transportation. The mechanization includes the use of ripper<br /><br />
bulldozers, excavators, tippers/dumpers and graders. Other operations include the use of stockpile<br /><br />
materials, drying and loading of the bauxite at Nitti Port, operations at the mechanical workshop and<br /><br />
the burning of farm bushes during the dry season by local residents.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Air emissions that result from these activities include carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx),<br /><br />
sulfur SOx), Total Organic Compounds (TOC), and Carbon dioxide (CO2). The major source of air<br /><br />
emissions is the combustion of diesel fuel used by the mine equipment fleet, mobile mining equipment,<br /><br />
other transportation, process plant operations, and the production of electricity. The receptors include<br /><br />
machine operators and nearby personnel within the plant site. The impact of such emission on air<br /><br />
quality is however minimal and the impacts are insignificant in the long term.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No assessment has been undertaken on the estimated rate of emission but it is expected that the<br /><br />
predicted concentration of these Green House Gases would be well below the criterion for all the<br /><br />
receptors and dust generation would only be severe in the dry season. Air quality assessment thus<br /><br />
constitutes a key environmental monitoring plan for SMHL operations. SMHL should ensure that a<br /><br />
periodic checking on regular emissions based on monitoring instrumentation is made and subsequent<br /><br />
reporting that describes conditions and corrective measures to avoid future impact on air quality.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Airborne particulates become very high during the dry season but very low in the wet season when<br /><br />
emissions are only limited to vehicular operations from mining and ore beneficiation. The receptors<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 85<br /><br />
<br /><br />
include project site boundary, nearby villages especially those settlements along major haul roads. The<br /><br />
impact is only high in the dry season and insignificant in the wet season.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There is an increase in dust with increasing traffic especially on the haul roads between Gbonge,<br /><br />
Gondama and Nitti. This affects the local communities within the access road and this is expected to<br /><br />
continue throughout the life of the mining operations. The scale of the impact is however local and may<br /><br />
increase only in the dry season.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mitigation measures need to be implemented to reduce the level of dust. This will include: reduction in<br /><br />
speed limits. Construction of speed bumps through villages and stabilization of road materials in<br /><br />
sensitive spots along the haul roads. Dust suppression through watering should form a major activity all<br /><br />
throughout the dry season to mitigate the impact of dust on the affected receptors. Vehicular operators<br /><br />
are also advised to adhere to the safety rules especially those introduced during training programmes.<br /><br />
With these mitigation measures applied, there will be no short-term and long-term impacts.<br /><br />
6.1.3 Noise<br /><br />
Most of the noise at the mine site is generated from activities of mining equipment such as excavators,<br /><br />
bulldozers, frontend loaders, mine trucks and stationary equipment including the wash plant, power<br /><br />
plant, dryer building at Nitti Port and the mechanical workshop. Heavy truck movement along the haul<br /><br />
road is another source of noise.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The plant site is located within a valley about 3 kilometres from the nearest village and separated from it<br /><br />
by farm bush. As such, it is unlikely that noise will impact on local residents. However, noise is having<br /><br />
effects on the workers in and around the plant site where most of the fixed noises are located. Noise is<br /><br />
having effects on wild life in the areas of mining activities; and since mining and ore processing go on for<br /><br />
two to three shifts a day. Highly significant noise levels will occur in the open pits and plant area all year<br /><br />
round.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It was not possible to calculate daytime sound pressure levels for the various components. But SMHL<br /><br />
environmental report for the third quarter of this year estimates noise levels for the various locations<br /><br />
and the results are reproduced in Table 16.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The noise levels for all the stations range between 70.69 and 85.22 decibels. The high noise level at the<br /><br />
Gondama stockpile was attributed to the high vehicular traffic (including dump trucks and light vehicles)<br /><br />
plying the haul road at the time of monitoring. All the equipment or noise sources however meet the<br /><br />
required noise limit for most mine operations of less than 85dBA. The maximum noise level at station Nl<br /><br />
1 (Washing Plant) would be expected to be above the measured limit of 79.2 decibels, especially when<br /><br />
other noise generating machinery (Loader) and the nearby generator that supplies electricity to the<br /><br />
entire plant site are nearer.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the field work, it was estimated that on the average, there were not more than 100 truck trips<br /><br />
two ways from mine panels to wash plant and to Nitti Port. This noise traffic will have a relatively minor<br /><br />
effect on the noise receptors along the main haul roads. These short-term noise impacts to residents will<br /><br />
be minimal but can be locally significant to employees in certain work areas at the plant site and mine<br /><br />
panels.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Noise mitigation measures to be considered for SMHL operations are as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 87<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Future facilities with high noise impacts should be located well away from noise sensitive areas<br /><br />
possibly adjacent to the stock pile areas around the plant site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All the heavy equipment and vehicles should be kept in good repair.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Some of the existing stationary noisy equipments should be insulated by screens or sheds.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Currently, no noise standard requirements have been established for Sierra Leone, but it is<br /><br />
recommended that in general, operations should meet the international noise standard<br /><br />
requirements.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mine faces should be used as noise barriers in the immediate vicinity of villages such as Gbonge,<br /><br />
Jenega and Konta.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Protective hearing devices should be used when employees are at work especially at or near<br /><br />
earth-moving equipment, wash plants and power houses.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.1.4 Geology and Soils<br /><br />
The topsoil in the area is thin and residual on both the foot slopes and hill slopes where most mining<br /><br />
activities take place. The major impact of mining on the local geology is visible in the removal of<br /><br />
overburden that is used in construction works and the excavation of ore deposit from the mine panels.<br /><br />
Soil erosion results due to this activity and the impact is high during heavy rainfall events when most<br /><br />
soils are washed and deposited in streams and valleys. This impact is unavoidable even though the<br /><br />
physical disturbance is low in the short and long term. Whilst these impacts could be significant,<br /><br />
mitigation measures follow the same procedures outlined for the reclamation of the mined out areas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The topsoil is however recovered, stockpiled and eventually used in the reclamation works. The<br /><br />
suitability of these soils for crop productivity constitutes part of this ESIA as a mitigation measure. SMHL<br /><br />
will implement the rehabilitation programme for the soils by comparing the quality of the pre-disturbed<br /><br />
soil to that of the exposed soils in the mined out areas. This will set up the criteria for soil enhancement<br /><br />
for different crops.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Major mitigation measures include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Separation of super soil from sub soil during removal.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Proper grading and reshaping of the disturbed areas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Adequate crop suitability procedures for reclamation work.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Prompt timing of re-vegetation on reclaimed lands to avoid top soil removal in the early rain<br /><br />
events.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Establishment of sediment raps, bunds and where necessary construction of diversion ditches.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Regular inspection of reclamation and repair works where needed; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Use of rock mulch on unprotected surfaces.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.1.5 Surface Water<br /><br />
Mining activities at SMHL project sites adversely impact on surface water quality. These processes<br /><br />
include:<br /><br />
 Vegetation removal for mining leaving behind very large tracts of land exposed to direct rainfall<br /><br />
and soil erosion. The eroded materials are transported into waterways thereby increasing<br /><br />
surface water turbidity.<br /><br />
 Runoff from solid wastes in water bodies resulting in contamination and blockage.<br /><br />
 Spillage of fuel or oil which will contaminate nearby drainage ways.<br /><br />
 Runoff from waste disposal sites from the plant site and Camp.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Impacts to surface water quality from these activities can have a locally high significance if no mitigation<br /><br />
measures are applied as a result of changes in water quality.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Currently, streams and other water bodies are being monitored at sensitive locations to ensure that<br /><br />
mining activities do not affect the downstream supply systems. The washing Plant does not require any<br /><br />
chemical reagent in ore processing. The decant water is thus expected to meet the IFC effluent<br /><br />
discharge guidelines.<br /><br />
To mitigate the adverse impacts on surface water quality, the following measures are proposed:<br /><br />
 Stockpiles and overburden should not be placed at nearby drainage ways.<br /><br />
 Waste oil, fuel and other lubricants should be stored in strong containments.<br /><br />
 Tailings Management Plan should be properly implemented. As much as possible, leakages into<br /><br />
earth fill dams should be avoided.<br /><br />
Efforts should be made in the wet season to ensure that rain water is diverted from the TSF. This is<br /><br />
achieved by constructing ditches around the perimeter of the TSF and channelled to the nearby drainage<br /><br />
system.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Page 89<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.1.6 Visual Resources<br /><br />
The former Sieromco mine pits and the current mined out areas around Gbonge deposits are the main<br /><br />
intermittent views around haul roads characterized by lower shrub vegetation and secondary forests.<br /><br />
Activities that are associated with visual impacts include former mine pits and scars, abandoned power<br /><br />
lines, former Sieromco plant sites around Mokanji, perimeter fences, traffic flow, dusts and<br /><br />
accumulation of these on leaves, speed bumps, burrow pits, tailings storage facilities and mine faces.<br /><br />
The major receptors include villages along main haul and access roads. These impacts are localized and<br /><br />
occur in the short term especially in the dry season. The following measures are proposed to minimize<br /><br />
visual intrusions that are outlined above.<br /><br />
 Where construction of power lines would be required, features should be designed so as to<br /><br />
achieve landscape designs.<br /><br />
 Burrow pits and mine faces should be graded so as to achieve professional landscape designs.<br /><br />
Impoundment dams should be rehabilitated to meet international standards.<br /><br />
6.1.7 Accidental Release of Sludge from Tailings Storage Facility<br /><br />
The facility was constructed with mechanisms that protect direct discharge of sediments into the earth<br /><br />
filled dams. Any failure is likely to have a discharge into these dams and local drainage systems<br /><br />
downstream of the facility. This could increase turbidity, conductivity and inorganic particulates in the<br /><br />
systems. Because of the relative immobility of the mud and the seasonality of weather conditions, the<br /><br />
severity of such an impact would be expected to be local and low with an overall impact rating of<br /><br />
moderate (high severity; low likelihood).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Recommended mitigation measures to minimize the impact potential include rehabilitation,<br /><br />
development and implementation of the Tailings Management Plan coupled with regular inspection<br /><br />
programme.<br /><br />
6.1.8 Wildlife, Protected Areas and Cultural Properties<br /><br />
There are no significant wildlife habitats reported to exist in the concession area, no wildlife sanctuaries<br /><br />
or protected site habitats have been identified in the study corridor. Therefore, no mitigation measures<br /><br />
are recommended. No known protected cultural or historical sites were identified except those found<br /><br />
surrounding villages including local religious facilities, local monuments, holy trees/springs or old burial<br /><br />
grounds. These sites will not directly be affected by land expropriation or lie in the vicinity of the works.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 90<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.1.9 Borrow Pits and Quarry Sites<br /><br />
Borrow pits and quarries are opened within road corridors in order to supply sub-base material and<br /><br />
crushed stone. The principal environmental concerns relate to the visual effects of quarrying and the<br /><br />
effects of access road rehabilitation works. There is less concern regarding impacts on development in<br /><br />
agricultural lands or close to settlements, since there does not seem to be a high probability of such<br /><br />
sites are being developed. Nevertheless, these aspects need to be considered during future quarry site<br /><br />
development.<br /><br />
The principal concerns in relation to borrow pits include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Access roads and borrow pits themselves may be developed in materials which are highly<br /><br />
erodible, and may contribute to enhanced erosion of a sensitive landscape;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Deep pits may be developed which are a safety hazard to people especially if they fill with water<br /><br />
during the wet season and become breeding grounds for insect disease vectors;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Since borrow pits will almost certainly be developed close to the road corridors, even if they are<br /><br />
not located in agricultural lands, access roads will probably have to traverse cultivated land, with<br /><br />
adverse effects on landholders if they are not properly reinstated when pit use ceases.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Even though the landscape has only average visual quality borrow pits will probably be<br /><br />
developed in elevated parts of the landscape, and scarring by working faces can permanently<br /><br />
spoil an otherwise pleasant view.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.1.10 Flora and Fauna<br /><br />
The mining activities of SMHL operations include clearing of vegetation for mining and stockpiling and<br /><br />
the deposition of mine spoils in unspecified areas. All these activities are impacting on the flora and<br /><br />
fauna species even though some of the land areas were previously disturbed before SMHL operations.<br /><br />
The impact is low to moderate of ecological value such as the loss of habitat, disturbance of rare species<br /><br />
and wild life. With increase in population in the concession area, the demand for bush meat increases<br /><br />
with the purchasing power of the people working for SMHL. The modification of the habitat is expected<br /><br />
to last long, but with implementation of mitigation measures, short, medium and long term impacts will<br /><br />
be expected to be favourable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 91<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There is also an ensuing expansion of farming activities to meet the food demands for the mining<br /><br />
community. This type of farming that is practiced has negative impacts only in the short term and is<br /><br />
localized. The following mitigations are proposed:<br /><br />
 Prompt mine reclamation activities in the mined out areas should be enhanced.<br /><br />
 If vulnerable or endangered species exist within the mine sites, measures should be taken to<br /><br />
create alternative sites.<br /><br />
6.2. Socio-economic Impacts<br /><br />
This section analyses the negative socio-economic impacts of the project activities on the social,<br /><br />
economic and biophysical environment and describes the recommended mitigation measures to<br /><br />
minimize, or mitigate these negative impacts.<br /><br />
6.2.1 Community Health and Safety<br /><br />
The GoSL provides Free Primary Health Care to children under the age of five and their mothers. SMHL<br /><br />
employees and their families have access to the health clinic at the mine site and referrals are often<br /><br />
made to the Serabu Hospital located 11 km. from the Gondama site. The likelihood of accidents and<br /><br />
work-related illnesses on the job as well as accidents occurring between mining related equipment and<br /><br />
local vehicles are inherent at SMHL operations. Though located in a rural setting, the mining area is<br /><br />
about 10 km. away from the closest medical facility and the likelihood for accidents to occur is assumed<br /><br />
to be low.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Only a few foreign workers are hired by SMHL most of these are highly educated mine engineers.<br /><br />
Therefore, the risk of spreading communicable diseases as a result of the project is considered minor<br /><br />
(medium severity; low likelihood). However, SMHL and its senior staff personnel should initiate<br /><br />
discussions of communicable diseases and sexually transmitted diseases into its health and safety plans.<br /><br />
The mitigation measures recommended to address this impact include the following:<br /><br />
• Provision of additional health facilities to the five affected chiefdoms;<br /><br />
• Provision of health services to all workers and their families, which will avoid new demands on health<br /><br />
services by Project out-of-area workers.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 92<br /><br />
<br /><br />
• Avoid and minimize environmental effects that have potential to affect health, including dust, noise,<br /><br />
and any effects that may negatively affect livelihood resources, such as contamination of the rivers or<br /><br />
farmlands.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Preventions should be taken against fire accidents and security should be imposed at all times.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.2.2 Traffic and Road Safety<br /><br />
The expansion of SMHL operations to Gbonge has increased vehicular traffic over the last few years.<br /><br />
Heavy vehicular transportation between Gondama and Nitti Port is estimated at about 6 trips per trucks<br /><br />
per shift and between Gbonge and Gondama 10 trips per shift per truck. This increase is of major<br /><br />
significance especially when the haul roads are concurrently been used by both SMHL and other public<br /><br />
vehicles. In some cases these haul roads are used by commercial bike riders. Similarly, pedestrians along<br /><br />
the road alignment will be exposed to the greatest risk. The greatest at risk are the linear settlements<br /><br />
such as Gbonge, Konta, Gondama, Mosenesie, Foala and Wunde.<br /><br />
Drivers, bike riders and pedestrians are gradually becoming accustomed to the increased traffic and<br /><br />
vehicle speeds, and it is likely that the number of accidents will show any level of concern.<br /><br />
Most of the traffic is currently associated with the Project is between Gondama and Gbonge.This traffic<br /><br />
represents relatively minimal safety risk to other vehicles. But the traffic between Gondama to Nitti Port<br /><br />
poses a greater risk to local residents as it is being used by other public vehicles. As such, the increase in<br /><br />
traffic is rated a moderate impact (moderate severity; moderate likelihood).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mitigation measures include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provide driver safety training to all workers, including contractors, who are expected to<br /><br />
drive as part of their duties, especially to be alert for pedestrians along the private haul<br /><br />
road;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Impose speed limits;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Schedule truck traffic along the public highways to avoid peak hours; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Introduce safety campaigns amongst the communities.<br /><br />
Implementation of these measures would reduce the impact to minor scale. The unpaved road requires<br /><br />
excessive repairs and maintenance to support traffic flow in the wet season.<br /><br />

6.2.3 Population Movements<br /><br />
With the existing high level of unemployment in the country, any development of projects such mining<br /><br />
is expected to attract a huge number of people seeking for jobs. Since the restart of bauxite mining, the<br /><br />
project area has attracted a large number of people seeking for job and providing support services such<br /><br />
as petty trading and commercial sex work. The influx in the area is cumulative as there are other mining<br /><br />
operations going on in nearby communities. The increase in population is expected to increase with the<br /><br />
demand for goods and services. The negative impacts that are occurring include; prostitution, spread of<br /><br />
diseases such as HIV and AIDS, STDs, disruption of social and cultural values of host communities, drug<br /><br />
and alcohol abuse, theft, domestic violence and noise. These impacts are expected to last for a long time<br /><br />
on a wider local level, but the significance is moderate.<br /><br />
To minimize such impacts, SMHL is expected to give job preference to the local population and only<br /><br />
when the local population is exhausted that hiring should be made from outside the mining community.<br /><br />
There is also a need for an increase in the provision of goods and services by introducing job<br /><br />
opportunities such as poultry and piggery farming, vegetable gardening, bakery, brick making,<br /><br />
entertainment centres, etc.<br /><br />
6.2.4 Gender Impacts<br /><br />
SMHL mining operations like most industries are having a severe impact on gender. These include: a.<br /><br />
Impacts on land ownership, b. impacts on economic activities, c. teenage pregnancy and early marriage.<br /><br />
Land is mainly owned by the section chiefs who are mainly male. At family level, land is mainly owned by<br /><br />
the eldest male (in the case of inheritance) or by the father who is the head of the household. Surveys<br /><br />
that have been done in the area indicate that men have more access to land for farming activities than<br /><br />
women. This situation may likely have a negative impact on the productive potential of women in many<br /><br />
of the villages in the area. The major economic activities include small scale farming, fishing and petty<br /><br />
trading. Due to the increase in the transportation cost, many women sell their crops at farm gate prices<br /><br />
to traders, thus getting less from the crops they cultivate.<br /><br />
There are variations in the roles and responsibilities in relation to economic activities. Women are<br /><br />
mainly involved in market gardening and men largely involved in working in the mines, swamp and<br /><br />
upland rice cultivation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There is a high level of teenage pregnancy in the project area. They survey reported that girls generally<br /><br />
drop out of school at an early stage. Many of the young girls who drop out school as a result teenage<br /><br />
pregnancy eventually end up in the bigger settlements like Moriba Town, Mokanji and Gbangbatoke.<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 94<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Social activities such as video shows and dances are responsible for the increasing rate of teenage<br /><br />
pregnancy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There are few secondary schools existing in the five chiefdoms. Failure to complete secondary school<br /><br />
education would mean an early marriage as there are no other socio-economic pursuits than trading.<br /><br />
Women in the community generally marry at an average age of 17 years and are liable to bear an<br /><br />
average of 8 children during the child bearing period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
These impacts outlined above are expected to last a long time occurring at a local scale. The severe<br /><br />
impact would be low to moderate and irreversible in some cases. Mitigation measures to address these<br /><br />
impacts include:<br /><br />
 Through SMHL’s corporate social responsibility program, it can promote other sectors of the<br /><br />
economy through training, establishing micro credit schemes and through serving as a<br /><br />
market for the agricultural produce by women.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 To prevent idleness among teenagers which lead to pregnancy, they should be provided with<br /><br />
family planning strategies and activities that promote social interaction and positive<br /><br />
community behaviour. Some of these social activities may include sports competitions with<br /><br />
the nearby schools and theatre.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Women, whose roles are mainly production and reproduction should participate actively in<br /><br />
decision-making processes concerning community life.<br /><br />
6.2.5 Community Expectations and Apprehensions<br /><br />
Bauxite mining has been going on the area for over fifty years by both SMHL and former SIEROMCO<br /><br />
Company. These have continued to provide employment opportunities and community development<br /><br />
initiatives in all the affected chiefdoms. These communities especially the two chiefdoms of Banta feel<br /><br />
that SMHL should provide more. Their job and other economic expectations continue to be high<br /><br />
including their proximity to the nearby SRL Ltd. Company.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Interactions between SMHL and the community continue to go on to address concerns and complaints<br /><br />
such as destruction of farmlands with inadequate crop compensations to farmers, dissatisfaction over<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 95<br /><br />
<br /><br />
reclamation methods, pollution in streams and rivers, inequitable implementation of development<br /><br />
projects etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Failure on the part of SMHL to address the concerns and needs of these local issues can have a direct<br /><br />
impact on the acceptability of the project within the host communities. The study however reveals that<br /><br />
the mining operations are expected to have a positive rating of project benefits to these communities.<br /><br />
Recommended mitigation measures to address these issues include the following:<br /><br />
 Implement and promote a more systemic grievance resolving mechanism associated with<br /><br />
SMHL project; and<br /><br />
 Implement the Community Development Action Plan (CDAP) and the ESIA (this document) that<br /><br />
outlines the stakeholder consultation process which is the means to optimize local economic<br /><br />
benefits and the promotion of SMHL’s corporate social responsibility. Successful application of<br /><br />
the process has the potential to increase the significant rating of the impact of the operations..<br /><br />
6.3 Cumulative Impacts<br /><br />
However, irrespective of their nature, the impacts of mining are likely to be experienced across the<br /><br />
region where mine concessions have been granted. Although it is not the role of this ESHIA to<br /><br />
recommend management for other mining operations, and the other operations must be subject to<br /><br />
their own EIA processes, the impacts of mining in the region must be seen holistically and appropriate<br /><br />
management measures must be implemented to limit the cumulative negative impacts of this and<br /><br />
adjacent mining concessions. It will therefore be important for the mining operations to communicate<br /><br />
and develop co-operative strategies to mitigate their cumulative impacts.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Both social and biophysical impacts can be expected to be cumulative in nature. The most important<br /><br />
cumulative impacts are:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Positive social impacts will result to improved economic conditions in the region. The creation<br /><br />
of a number of mining operations will result in the creation of a large, albeit dispersed market<br /><br />
for goods and services, which will significantly stimulate the local economy and act as a catalyst<br /><br />
for the government to improve service delivery in the region.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Negative social impacts, for instance:<br /><br />
o a population influx (due to other mining operations)<br /><br />
o Price inflation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 96<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o Change in livelihood from agriculture to mining<br /><br />
o Increased social delinquency<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ecosystem function in terms of terrestrial faunal species is already heavily degraded. Thus the<br /><br />
miming activities will compound the existing faunal impoverishment due to existing land use<br /><br />
and settlement. Most threatened large mammals and birds have been impacted nationally by<br /><br />
unsustainable exploitation and previous land use patterns. Further loss of such species due to<br /><br />
the potential impacts would exacerbate this loss. The significant loss will need to be addressed<br /><br />
as post mining activities such as farming may likely not reverse this situation. These impacts<br /><br />
cannot be mitigated in the near future. It is however proposed that a Strategic Environmental be<br /><br />
made for the entire two mining communities that will address this issue.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Impacts on water quality and quantity in the Taia river system and ultimately the entire region.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Diversification of mining operations in Bonthe and Moyamba Districts: There is an ongoing<br /><br />
exploration programme for dry mining by SRL that likely overlap with current mining activities at<br /><br />
SRL and SMHL. The most important cumulative impacts that is associated withese activities are<br /><br />
those related to the diversification of mining operations in the two communities. These impact<br /><br />
may be difficult to assess as all the activities are different from each other and the ESIA that is<br /><br />
prepared can be considered as site specific assessing set of activities only associated with a<br /><br />
single operation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The road transport infrastructure connecting the two projects to one another needs to be<br /><br />
recognised in terms of its cumulative effect, rather than simply relative to each of the individual<br /><br />
projects. Even though the infrastructure is already in place, an important public concern is dust<br /><br />
generated by haulage trucks and other publc transport. A mitigation action that will be pursued<br /><br />
by the two mines is to resurface the haul roads with bitumen especially for post mining use.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cumulative impacts have been addressed in the mitigation measures identified in this Study; and these<br /><br />
mitigation measures have been incorporated in the ESMP. Some of the mitigation measures will require<br /><br />
the setting up of cooperative structures with other mining concessionaires within the region.<br /><br />

Section Seven – Environmental Management Plan<br /><br />
This Environmental Management Plan for SMHL is complimentary to the Environmental and Social<br /><br />
Impact Assessment (ESIA) presented in this report that clearly defines all the residual and other specific<br /><br />
actions that SMHL undertakes to implement the measures that will minimize and mitigate any negative<br /><br />
impacts on the human, social and environmental aspects within and around the operational area.<br /><br />
Four main environmental plans are outlined for implementation including: a. Environmental Monitoring<br /><br />
Plan, b. Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for health and safety workers and properties, c.<br /><br />
Tailings Management Plan and d. Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan. Attention is also paid to specific<br /><br />
environmental elements including air, noise, and waste and water quality. Proper implementation of<br /><br />
the plans will be supported by Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s), Training, Documentation,<br /><br />
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting. Corrective actions will be suggested for review by management.<br /><br />
7.1 Environmental Monitoring Plan<br /><br />
The Environmental Monitoring Plan is specifically designed and implemented for collecting data on<br /><br />
ambient air, water quality, noise level including release of pollutants of major concern and weather.<br /><br />
The objective of air quality management on the mine site is to minimise the generation of suspended<br /><br />
concentrations of deposition of mine derived dust both at the nearest residential villages around the<br /><br />
mine and those linear settlements along the haul roads. To monitor air quality, SMHL will operate and<br /><br />
maintain a network of 4 depositional dust gauges on the mine site to be monitored monthly in<br /><br />
accordance with National and International standards. A book keeping system will be developed for<br /><br />
presenting the raw data. This will be in a form of tables and graphs of the original data. The tables will<br /><br />
further be used to produce statistical summaries which will form the basis of further analysis and<br /><br />
interpretation.<br /><br />
The major sources of noise in mining and related operations in SMHL’s operational area include loading,<br /><br />
excavation, crushing, screening, beneficiation, movement of heavy earth moving vehicles and truck<br /><br />
loading. The locations are the mine sites at Gbonge, Konta, and Wunde, The Washing Plant at<br /><br />
Gondama, Nitti Port and along the main haul roads. Noise levels shall be monitored both during day and<br /><br />
evening on the same day while in operation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 98<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The water quality monitoring plan is developed to satisfy the water quality requirements of the EPA/SL.<br /><br />
It is designed to provide information regarding the overall water quality within SMHL project sites,<br /><br />
identify potential water quality problems related to the project operations and how such factors can be<br /><br />
controlled, and to develop measures for the protection and mitigation of water quality. In situ and<br /><br />
analytical water quality monitoring will be performed over a nine month period during the first week of<br /><br />
each month from April to December. The date, time, location, weather conditions and the in situ water<br /><br />
quality data will be recorded on a standard form which will later be transcribed into an electronic format<br /><br />
in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. GPS coordinates and photographs will be taken at each site to<br /><br />
document conditions at the time of sampling.<br /><br />
7.2 Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (ERCP)<br /><br />
This Plan is Sierra Minerals Holdings Ltd. operation’s guide to all procedures and courses of action that<br /><br />
should be followed in the case of any on-site emergency. It identifies those responsible for taking action<br /><br />
immediately after the discovery of and during the response to an emergency, as well as their respective<br /><br />
duties.<br /><br />
Specifically, it will:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
address any disaster, mishaps or accidents that will disrupt the normal operations of the<br /><br />
industry;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
guide the administration to be better prepared to respond to emergencies in its operational<br /><br />
area in an effective manner; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ultimately, help to save the lives, reduce property loss or damage as well as the company’s<br /><br />
liability.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The plans that have been developed for a number of emergencies include:<br /><br />
Fire/Explosion Emergency: In preparing for fire incidences, the Environmental Health and Safety Officer<br /><br />
(EHSO) will be responsible for training a team that will respond to all accidents in how to suppress fire,<br /><br />
rescue personnel and all other drills relating to fire incidences.<br /><br />
The response plan for fire or explosion will require an immediate action and to undertake a recovery<br /><br />
operation to restore essential services to the mine site, cleaning and replacement of materials and<br /><br />
equipments that were damaged.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Accidental spills or release of hazardous materials: The purpose of the Spill Prevention and Control<br /><br />
Plan is to establish procedures and guidelines to prevent oil discharges on SMHL Project sites at<br /><br />
Gondama, Nitti Port and Mata Camp. This Plan specifically establishes proper procedures and<br /><br />
equipments needed to address any potential discharges of oils.<br /><br />
SMHL owns six barges that transport bauxite materials from Nitti Port. For spills or release of hazardous<br /><br />
materials in these barges, both preventive and preparatory measures have to be undertaken. A special<br /><br />
emergency response procedure will be developed for both measures.<br /><br />
Road Accidents: The major operational areas of SMHL are interspersed with villages mostly situated<br /><br />
along the main road from Mokanji to Nitti Port, from Mosenesie to Gondama, to Serabu and Mattru.<br /><br />
These roads are used both by public transport, Sierra Rutile Mines and SMHL.<br /><br />
Currently, SMHL outsources contractors that transport mine products to the plant and to Nitti Port. The<br /><br />
contractors will be required to sign agreement with SMHL for compliance with all codes and regulations<br /><br />
that bind transportation of mine products. All vehicles will be equipped with first aid kit and fire<br /><br />
extinguishers.<br /><br />
Floods: The overall objective of this plan is to support the timely and coordinated response to<br /><br />
anticipated floods in the rainy season. This will effectively minimize the impact of such floods on<br /><br />
personnel, infrastructure and the environment. The major receptors will include: mining sites, haulage<br /><br />
roads, main road between Gondama and Mosenesie, main tributaries of the Taia River and the inland<br /><br />
valley swamps within the project area. Other specific sectors to be affected will include: water and<br /><br />
sanitation, bridges and culverts, road sections, communication infrastructure, meteorological and other<br /><br />
monitoring equipments and disruption of electricity.<br /><br />
Crisis Situations/Social Strife: These situations are brought about by unpredictable circumstances that<br /><br />
degenerate into uncontrollable proportions causing chaos. To address these incidences, SMHL will<br /><br />
develop a plan for the dissemination of information to the public. This will include setting up a<br /><br />
mechanism for dealing with grievances in such that issues can be addressed formerly and amicably.<br /><br />
Roles and Responsibilities: A team of qualified personnel from within SMHL’s management will have<br /><br />
direct responsibilities for addressing all emergencies presented above. These include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The General Manager is the overall head who will be responsible for coordinating all activities<br /><br />
and actions at the project site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Environmental Health and Safety Manager who directly reports to the site manager will be<br /><br />
responsible for the overall implementation of the EHS Plan.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Environmental Officer (EO) will assist the EHSM in responding to all emergencies by<br /><br />
coordinating efforts with other site personnel to mitigate the potential hazards, assist EHSM to<br /><br />
prepare reports, disseminate information on emergencies to staff, work site supervisor during<br /><br />
emergencies, to remediate events and report accordingly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Community Affairs Manager (CAM) will be responsible for all matters that have to do with<br /><br />
public relations. In consultation with the General Manager, he will be responsible for<br /><br />
communications with the public including information on incidents in particular to the affected<br /><br />
community and the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
He will lead the site Supervisors in responding to emergencies and work with the HSO to<br /><br />
remediate potential hazards and emergencies.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Site Supervisors who will be responsible for identifying potential events and coordinating any<br /><br />
response to events that occur in their work area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A response team which will be recruited and trained by the EHSM for all emergencies on site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Communication and Monitoring: The methods and procedures that will be applied in the event of<br /><br />
emergencies will include: a. Internal Communication that will be used to alert workers to hazards by<br /><br />
means of alarms, cell phones and radios. b. Training will be required during the workshop for all<br /><br />
employees on this system of communication.<br /><br />
SMHL will establish and maintain a monitoring system of its activities that could have an environmental<br /><br />
health and safety impact. This will include a recording of information on performance, and an evaluation<br /><br />
of compliances with legal and other requirements.<br /><br />
7.3 Tailings Dam Management Plan<br /><br />
Currently, Gondama plant site has two dumps for storing the sludge which is a slurry mixture of mineral<br /><br />
suspended matters and industrial water. The two sludge settling and storage dumps are built to be<br /><br />
operated and to function independently so that the repairs or emergency interventions do not disturb<br /><br />
the main activity. The sludge settling pond no.1 is built East from the washing plant and consists of<br /><br />
three washing sludge retention ponds separated by embankments (separating dams) and provided with<br /><br />
clear and storm water discharge spillways. The sludge settling pond no. 2, built west from the washing<br /><br />

<br /><br />
plant takes into consideration the settling operations and water clearing operation under normal<br /><br />
parameters before the water is discharged in the water streams.<br /><br />
SMHL’s production target is set up at 1.7 million tons of washed bauxite per year, the washing plant<br /><br />
operating with a production capacity of 330 tons/h. The washing operation consists of removing the<br /><br />
tailings with clay, ferruginous mineral silica content, pieces of rocks from the conveyor belts as well as<br /><br />
other materials which are in the ore composition. Therefore, as calculated in the time frame and for the<br /><br />
purpose reaching a good washing efficiency, the washing plant requires 10,000 cubic meters of water/<br /><br />
day.<br /><br />

To reduce the quantity of water used in the bauxite washing operations, a study was prepared<br /><br />
concerning the installation of a new pumping station in order to recirculate and reuse the clear water so<br /><br />
as to reduce the caught water requirement and water discharged to surface outlets. This would also<br /><br />
lead to a reduction in the costs associated with the electric power currently consumed from using the<br /><br />
open system and which could be applied in the next stage. An additional water pump has been installed<br /><br />
in order to reduce the quantity of water caught from Taia River.<br /><br />
The downstream side of the embankment shall be provided with spillways, grassy berms to prevent the<br /><br />
mentioned incidents (which are likely to cause failures of the hydro-technical constructions, including<br /><br />
dump closing, if the depression curve is above the attention level) from happening.<br /><br />
Monitoring: The monitoring is achieved by the sludge dump operator and the daily and/ or weekly<br /><br />
observations, readings are recorded in the Registry Book for the control and monitoring of the settling<br /><br />
pond behaviour over time, where the day, hour, data taken in the measuring points, comments and<br /><br />
conclusions are recorded.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The monitoring activity is mainly focused on verifying the following elements whose purpose is to<br /><br />
minimize the ecological, social and economical risk situations.<br /><br />
The monitoring of the sludge deposit area and the embankments freeboard shall include the recording<br /><br />
of the area width, the hydraulic surface area and the excessive accumulation of storm waters in the<br /><br />
pond.<br /><br />
The monitoring also consists of quarterly land surveys which provide updated information regarding the<br /><br />
coordinates and levelling of the area as compared to reference data, so that the horizontal and vertical<br /><br />
movements on the sinking landmarks comply with the limits set up in the regulation and not endanger<br /><br />
the embankments safety.<br /><br />
The sludge dump operation is monitored by the following measuring and control systems:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hydrometric gauges;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Fix and mobile topographic landmarks network;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Control and sinking landmarks, mileposts, placed in the areas sensitive to wetting;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Observation areas for possible ex-filtration’s;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sampling and monitoring points for the quality of waters discharged into the water streams.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The current assessment activity concerning the safety of the sludge dump components mainly consists<br /><br />
of the following:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Daily checking by the internal personnel of the constructions, operational facilities, slurry<br /><br />
transport ducts slipways operation. Responsible Chief Miners, Topometer SMHL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Daily reading of the piezometric level at the observation drillings. Responsible Environmental<br /><br />
Labs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Verification of potential movements at the landmarks monitoring the hydro-technical<br /><br />
constructions safety and stability.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Verification twice a year of the topographic landmarks height levels and coordinates, of the<br /><br />
horizontal and vertical movement value in the case of control landmarks positioned on the crest<br /><br />
and slopes of the pond.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The monitoring of the embankment constructions behaviour in time is a job assignment of the operating<br /><br />
personnel and the results interpretation shall be made by the engineer responsible for the sludge dump<br /><br />
supervision.<br /><br />
Monitoring of the sludge dump also includes physical- chemical analyses performed in the laboratory by<br /><br />
means of fix and mobile instrumentation in order to check the compliance of the emissions and<br /><br />
emissions within the maximum accepted limits stipulated by the regulations in force for the following<br /><br />
environmental factors:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Air – analysis of the air emissions shall be performed once a year in the area bordering the<br /><br />
sludge dump and the analyses results shall be interpreted against the suspended dust and<br /><br />
particulate matter maximum accepted limits stipulated by the regulations in force.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Surface water – physical- chemical analyses shall be performed on the water discharged to the<br /><br />
outlet at intervals as specified for each of the characteristic indicators: suspended matters,<br /><br />
heavy metals. The results of these analyses shall also be compared to the maximum approved<br /><br />
limits stipulated by the applicable regulations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Soil – soil samples shall be taken from the sludge dump vicinity at least once a year, especially<br /><br />
from those areas located in the main direction of the wind and laboratory analyses shall be<br /><br />
performed to determine the heavy metal content at 30cm average depth.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The alternative to build successive ponds and embankment downstream from the operational ponds of<br /><br />
the eastern dump is under analysis, however, such possibility can only be taken into consideration<br /><br />
during the last years of operation and useful deposit running-off in the mining perimeter, in order not to<br /><br />
endanger the safe operation of the dams and possibly of the embankments raised at maximum height of<br /><br />
the crest as stipulated in the regulation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.4 Waste Management Plan<br /><br />
This Waste Management Plan (WMP) was prepared for bauxite mining activities by Sierra Mineral<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The objectives of this Management Plan are to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for SMHL construction, operations and closure<br /><br />
activities;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Define the company’s requirements and procedures to guide the Project Management Team<br /><br />
and other Project contractors;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Define roles and responsibilities of the waste management team;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Present remedial measures to minimize waste generation; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Define monitoring and reporting procedures for waste management.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The plan addresses the management of both industrial and domestic waste. The plan covers all activities<br /><br />
that could result in the generation of waste and the potential adverse effects of waste and domestic<br /><br />
waste throughout all phases of the Project. The main issues that are addressed include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Types of wastes to be generated:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Methods used to identify those wastes;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Handling procedures and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Methods of disposal<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The types of wastes that are expected to be generated during the construction and operational stages of<br /><br />
the project are identified. Depending on the types to be generated, certain wastes are expended to be<br /><br />
disposed of at site, reused or recycled. The waste disposal facilities and methods of disposal are fully<br /><br />
discussed in this plan.<br /><br />
Waste Management Procedures<br /><br />
SMHL will apply the following management procedures for waste.<br /><br />
Waste Recycling: SMHL consults with the community on the demand for any recyclable products such<br /><br />
<br /><br />
as scrap metal, used tires, cardboard and wood which may have a value or a use locally. The company<br /><br />
also plans to look at commercial options for recycling; if recycling facilities are available and accessible<br /><br />
on a commercially-justifiable basis, waste will be recycled. If not, waste will be disposed of in accordance<br /><br />
with this Management Plan<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Solid Waste: This includes all office wastes, concrete, steel, rubble, timber, plasterboard and mixed<br /><br />
<br /><br />
construction waste. These are all classified as non-hazardous. These will mainly be generated during the<br /><br />
operational phase with minor amounts generated in the construction and decommissioning phases.<br /><br />
5.4 Liquid Wastes<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The procedure for managing these wastes includes the following:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Any spills will be cleaned up using absorbent materials and placed in bins;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There will be no onsite disposal of liquid direct to the soil surface or storm water collection<br /><br />
system; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non-hazardous waste bins will be finally disposed of to the incinerator or the landfill which is<br /><br />
an engineered cell within the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Litter: This includes any general litter on-site, and the objective is to minimise the visual impact of litter<br /><br />
<br /><br />
on the site and surrounding area, and minimise the potential to attract vermin. This will be achieved<br /><br />
through the provision of appropriate disposal facilities around the project site.<br /><br />
Mine and Processing Waste: For the mine and processing wastes, it is the responsibility of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Operation Manager to undertake waste characterization and manage the monitoring program to ensure<br /><br />
that the proposed waste management practices are appropriate to the wastes being generated. .<br /><br />
Responsibilities, Training and Record Keeping<br /><br />
During SML’s operation, the Environment Health and Safety Manager will be responsible for the<br /><br />
operation and record keeping of the Waste Management Plan.<br /><br />
Monitoring and Control<br /><br />
The following monitoring programs will be undertaken by SML and appropriate records will be kept.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Refuse quantity and material delivered to the domestic waste facility, hazardous waste<br /><br />
facility and composing facility;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Surface and groundwater monitoring;<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Surrounding vegetation and soils around waste facilities; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non-environmental features, such as, fences, roads, and signs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notice will be placed around the landfill and hazardous facility to promote worker and resident safety.<br /><br />
The Environmental, Health and Safety Manager will be responsible for distributing and maintaining<br /><br />
these notices and signs. The wastes facilities will be maintained with security in prevent unauthorised<br /><br />
access to the landfill site.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.5 Occupational Health and Safety Plan<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Roles and Responsibilities<br /><br />
The General Manager is the overall head who will be responsible for coordinating all activities and actions at the<br /><br />
project site. He will work with other managers who will be responsible for specific activities that will have to do<br /><br />
with the health and safety of workers. Along with the Environmental Health and Safety Manager and the<br /><br />
Community Affairs Manager, he will also be responsible for all other relations outside the project site as and<br /><br />
when needed to make sure that the mining community is adequately informed about events.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hazard Identification and Risk Analyses<br /><br />
All hazards identified at SMHL operations are assessed in accordance with the Risk Matrix prepared in<br /><br />
this plan which takes into account the probabilities of occurrence and severity of consequences in<br /><br />
relation to personnel and assets of the project and surrounding environment. In this regard, all<br /><br />
employees and contractors will be involved in the training of hazard identification and risk assessment<br /><br />
process so that day-to-day hazards are identified and control measures are determined and<br /><br />
implemented.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The following steps that SMHL plans to identify and manage risks during the life cycle of its operation<br /><br />
will include:<br /><br />
 Identification of hazards that exist in the project area;<br /><br />
 Assessment of risks entailed in these hazards;<br /><br />
 Evaluation of the degree of the risk represented by each hazard;<br /><br />
 Evaluation of the consequences resulting from the hazards by selecting the category which best<br /><br />
describes the effects of the mishaps on personnel, the general public and the environment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Identification of Hazards<br /><br />
This will entail gathering of information on biophysical, chemical and technical properties of the project<br /><br />
site and surrounding areas. Inclusive of these are artificial accidents and natural hazards such as fire,<br /><br />
explosion, equipment failures etc.<br /><br />

Risk Analyses<br /><br />
Knowledge of potential risks from these natural hazards, in both the environment, mine facilities, mine<br /><br />
personnel and the public is necessary for establishing the health, safety, and environmental<br /><br />
management objectives and how to manage them with the most appropriate mitigation measures. The<br /><br />
determination of the risk of an incident/accident associated with each hazard at the project’s<br /><br />
operational sites will entail:<br /><br />
 Identification of the potential failures or accidents;<br /><br />
 Quantification of the material that may released when any failure takes place;<br /><br />
 An estimation of the probability of occurrences; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
An evaluation of the effects of such occurrences based on certain scenarios such as most<br /><br />
probable and worst case events.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
First Aid Responses<br /><br />
The key objective of the First Aid response is to demonstrate that there is an effective emergency<br /><br />
response process put at the mine site put in place to reduce the impact of an emergency to levels that<br /><br />
meet the expectations and needs of personnel, and the mining community. All the personnel at the<br /><br />
project site will be first trained, from which a specialist team will be set up and trained in the first aid<br /><br />
response plan that will involve the identification of potential risks and the provision of feedback to<br /><br />
improve on the response plan. First aid boxes will be installed at all strategic locations including vehicles<br /><br />
that are in use during operations. To achieve the above objectives, SMHL shall undertake the following:<br /><br />
 Ensure that qualified first-aid is provided at the project site at all times;<br /><br />
 Equipped first-aid station and eye wash points should be provided close to all work places<br /><br />
where immediate flushing with water is the recommended first-aid response.<br /><br />
 Develop and maintain first-aid procedure;<br /><br />

response;<br /><br />
 Develop specific potential emergencies as outlined in the risk matrix; and<br /><br />
 Prepare and implement an emergency response manual for the project to include procedures<br /><br />
for integrating SMHL procedures with other contractors’ procedures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Incident/Accident Reporting<br /><br />
The objective is to demonstrate that appropriate procedures are put in place for the systematic<br /><br />
reporting of accidents, incidents and near misses; and for an effective follow up and review of safety<br /><br />
performance made to prevent measures of adverse situations. The process will include:<br /><br />
 An identification of the causes of incidents and accidents;<br /><br />
 Ensuring a systematic approach for reporting and investigating incidents and accidents; and<br /><br />
 Preventing future accidents and incidents.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Safety Officer will compile and maintain records of each accident/incident occurring, including<br /><br />
details in each case of any corrective action taken. To achieve this, SMHL shall develop, implement and<br /><br />

 Accident reporting system; Corrective action register with records of all occurrences and<br /><br />
progress on the follow up of corrective actions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Employee Health and Safety Data System<br /><br />
SMHL will maintain a data system for the collection, storage, analysis, retrieval and dissemination of all<br /><br />
health and safety information on its employees.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In collaboration with SMHL medical personnel, the EHS Manager and the Human Resources Manager,<br /><br />
the Safety Officer shall develop, implement and maintain a procedure for the collection, maintenance<br /><br />
and confidential retention of employee health and safety information. The procedure will detail<br /><br />
performance indicators that will be compared to similar mining operations. Such data will be reported<br /><br />
on monthly basis.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To ensure the integrity of SMHL project and safety of its personnel, a health monitoring system will<br /><br />
established to ensure that employees are fit for work and be able to work safely at all times. To achieve<br /><br />
this, SMHL shall develop, implement and maintain a health monitoring procedure which will include:<br /><br />
 A medical report prior to employment;<br /><br />
 Injury management and return to work system; and<br /><br />
 Fitness for work procedures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Monitoring and Training<br /><br />
Occupational health and safety monitoring programs will be established to verify the effectiveness of<br /><br />
prevention and control strategies. The occupational health and safety monitoring program should<br /><br />
include: Safety inspection and testing which will include regular inspection and testing of all safety<br /><br />
features focusing on engineering and personal protective features, work procedures, places of work,<br /><br />
installations, equipment, and tools used. All instruments installed or used for monitoring and recording<br /><br />
of working environment parameters should be regularly tested and calibrated, and the respective<br /><br />
records maintained. Monitoring and analyses should be conducted according to internationally<br /><br />
recognized methods and standards.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Training activities for employees and visitors should be adequately monitored and documented.<br /><br />
Emergency exercises, including fire drills, should be documented adequately. Other service providers<br /><br />
and contractors will be required to submit to SMHL adequate training documentation before start of<br /><br />
their assignment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.6 Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan<br /><br />
Under the current EPA/SL requirements, SMHL is required to provide updates to the reclamation Plan as<br /><br />
mining proceeds. These updates will include revision of the reclamation and closure plan that will<br /><br />
address the actual site conditions. It will include new data such as the reclaimed sites to date, proposed<br /><br />
waste dump sites, etc. Periodic reviews of the plan will be undertaken in accordance with EPA/SL<br /><br />
requirements.<br /><br />
The reclamation plan that is developed is in consistent with the following guidelines and regulations:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Guidelines addressed by the EPA/SL,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Best standard practices of the International Finance Corporation (IFC),<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SMHL guidelines for reclamation of tailings pond and other facilities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The reclamation objectives for the plan include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Converting areas disturbed by mining to a condition appropriate for pre-mining uses such as<br /><br />
cropland and small residential development.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning and salvaging on mine sites, facilities, buildings, equipments and ancillary<br /><br />
facilities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ensuring the mitigation of adverse impacts in the post mining scenario, including residual<br /><br />
problems such as soil erosion, slope failures, waste piling on slopes, and ground water seepage<br /><br />
from mine works.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Establish a long-term biophysical stability in the disturbed areas so as to minimize the<br /><br />
requirements for long-term monitoring.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mine Reclamation and Closure Methods: SMHL has been engaged in reclamation activities concurrently<br /><br />
<br /><br />
with mining, thereby reducing reclamation costs at the end of the project as well as developing and<br /><br />
improving reclamation techniques to maximize vegetation success and productivity.<br /><br />
The activities to be undertaken by SMHL will include:<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 118<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Slope Stability and Surface Water Protection: Some of the structural measures that will be put<br /><br />
in place will include diversions, backfilling and the construction of grass waterways. On the<br /><br />
Gbonge Hills for example, cut and fills will be part of the extraction and reclamation activities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Soil Salvage and Redistribution: Materials that are used for reclamation will be collected from<br /><br />
previously stockpiled wastes produced prior to excavation. The quantity of soil that will be<br /><br />
placed over the entire site will vary according to the availability or volume of stockpiles, the<br /><br />
plant species that is used, and the proposed land use of the site and the steepness of the slope.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Surface Grading and Seedbed Preparation: Surface grading will be consistent with the<br /><br />
surrounding topography. Sediment and erosion control measures may include installation of silt<br /><br />
fences, diversion channels and sediment traps. The final result will be a scenario of land use that<br /><br />
will be safe for farming by the local community. For the mine panels, reclamation will involve<br /><br />
stabilizing the panel surfaces and establishing vegetation cover. Backfilling will be carried out<br /><br />
until a Salvaging and Demolition of Facilities: Demolition procedures for all facilities will<br /><br />
include removal of: a. hazardous materials from sites; b. equipments and buildings; c. power<br /><br />
lines; d. burial of concrete foundations etc.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Specific Reclamation Methods: Specific reclamation activities will be undertaken including:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Access roads constructed during Sieromco period. The major roads to Gbonge, Walihun, Nitti<br /><br />
and Mokanji are used both by SMHL and the public with repairs done by the former. These may<br /><br />
not be required for closure, but the repair works will be taken over by the Sierra Leone Roads<br /><br />
Authority (SLRA). Only access and haulage roads of no economic significance will be closed by<br /><br />
ripping to remove compaction and regarding to blend with the local terrain.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Waste Facilities: The closure of this facility will include salvaging of the soil to cover the dump<br /><br />
site shaped to enhance good drainage conditions. This cover will be revegetated using the<br /><br />
necessary soil treatment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Stockpiles: Progressive reclamation of these sites will include regarding, construction of soil<br /><br />
cover, and revegetation. It is expected that all stockpiles will be completely processed prior to<br /><br />
closure. The covered and reclaimed areas will be monitored and where necessary, maintained<br /><br />
for years.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tailings Pond: Currently, physical upgrading of the tailings pond at Gondama is necessary and<br /><br />
this will be initiated very soon. Plans are also ahead for a new tailings facility to be constructed.<br /><br />
Reclamation and closure of any these facilities will commence at the end of the mining<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Final Report: Prepared by TEDAEnvironmental Consultant: November: 2012<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
operations. Based on the available information on the physical structure of the pond, the<br /><br />
establishment of vegetative cover is the most suitable strategy. Revegetation trials will be<br /><br />
undertaken to select the most effective method. Because of its physical properties, additional<br /><br />
growth medium would be required to enhance stabilization and plant growth. Once properly<br /><br />
stabilized, revegetation will be done accordingly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
gentle rolling topography is established. Methods of revegetation will include seeding, plant<br /><br />
propagation and tree or shrub planting. Alley Farming will be introduced to minimize the<br /><br />
commonly bush fallowing practices. The method will provide green manure from hedgerows for<br /><br />
the tree crops, provide shade during fallow periods, create barriers that will control soil erosion<br /><br />
on sloping lands and provide wood-fuel for domestic purposes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Community Involvement: In the implementation of this MRCP, SMHL will implement an effective and<br /><br />
transparent engagement, communication and verifiable reporting arrangements with the company’s<br /><br />
stakeholders making sure that the affected communities are given the opportunity to ask questions<br /><br />
discuss the plan and express any concerns they may have, so that SMHL will be able to respond to<br /><br />
comments received.<br /><br />
Closure Cost Estimates, Implementation schedule and Monitoring: The closure estimate presented<br /><br />
<br /><br />
herein is based on the general assumption that mining will proceed as planned, and the concurrent<br /><br />
reclamation activities would be based on the mine plan of operations as amended. The estimated cost<br /><br />
(Table 13) is $26,675,000.00. This estimate is based on the assumption that SMHL continues to<br /><br />
undertake the rehabilitation and future decommissioning at the end of the project. The highest cost<br /><br />
estimate is that for returning the land to its prior use for agriculture and forestry. It must be however<br /><br />
noted that although SMHL is performing concurrent reclamation, adequate monitoring report is not<br /><br />
available to provide details of the quality of work performed so far. Also, due to the fact that SMHL has<br /><br />
not produced plans indicating final limits of mining and land disturbance, the estimates have been<br /><br />
prepared based on professional judgment. An estimate based on actual plans may result in an estimate<br /><br />
higher than these provided.<br /><br />
Post closure monitoring will be undertaken to ensure that the reclamation and closure objectives are<br /><br />
met. The aspects that will be monitored will include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Vegetation: Site inspection to determine abundance and composition, and the overall success of<br /><br />
revegetation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Slope Stability: Site inspection of physical conditions for soil erosion and slope failures at the end<br /><br />
of the wet season.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Water Quality: monitoring of parameters for quality and recovery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Security Deposit: A security deposit to be provided by SMHL is considered as part of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
reclamation and closure liability for the mines. The estimate that is provided here assumes that<br /><br />
SMHL is performing progressive reclamation activities. As such, SMHL should be entitled to a<br /><br />
reduction in the security requirements agreed upon between SMHL and the GOSL. At the time<br /><br />
of preparing this report, no security bond has been prepared and this is anticipated as soon as<br /><br />
possiblic.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Section 8 – Conclusions and Recommendations<br /><br />
8.1 Conclusions<br /><br />
When all the impacts are considered the two most prominent are those that are prevalent on surface<br /><br />
water, including the hydrology and natural drainage systems in the natural environment and the<br /><br />
disconnect existing between the communities expectations and apprehensions and the realistic gains<br /><br />
which may accrue through a more equitable transfer mechanism. Although there will be a number of<br /><br />
social impacts of high significance, the majority of the impacts on social conditions are of moderate<br /><br />
significance.<br /><br />
The positive economic impact of the mines is highly significant, and the revenue from taxation that will<br /><br />
accrue to government provides resources that can be used to significantly improve the condition of<br /><br />
infrastructure in the South east region of the country . The economic benefit to the local economy is also<br /><br />
significant, since the project will not only support several hundred employees directly, but it will also<br /><br />
support significantly more of their dependents. It is estimated that, on average, each employee will<br /><br />
support eight dependents or family members. This should result in a general improvement in standards<br /><br />
of living in the study area and provides an alternative livelihood to the current subsistence farming.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There is however the need for the Company to institute a more systemic mechanism for the resolution<br /><br />
of social contentions and provide a more effective platform for dialogue with the host communities and<br /><br />
other stakeholders. It would also be imperative that the Community Development Action Plan (CDAP) be<br /><br />
validated and implemented.<br /><br />
8.2 Recommendations<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Agricultural Development Fund should be made available through the District Council<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Ensure prompt payment of surface rent and compensation to the appropriate beneficiary<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Re-assessment/re-evaluation of total land area slated as concession zone<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Involve the communities in land negotiation and benefit sharing mechanism in order to avoid<br /><br />
future disputes and disruption in the mining operation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Develop sustainable livelihood framework in the community – skills training, scholarships,<br /><br />
income diversification schemes etc<br /><br />

Household characteristics<br /><br />
Analysis of socioeconomic data at chiefdom level in the selected communities studied, show that<br /><br />
majority of interviewed respondents were males (71.7%). Although the nature of these are male<br /><br />
dominated as indicated in the number of respondents, the team solicited information from a substantial<br /><br />
number of women (28.3%). This implies that the reported socioeconomic issues in the chiefdoms have<br /><br />
included both men and women feelings and perceptions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 143<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As presented in Table A-3 majority of the interviewed respondents in the chiefdoms where data were<br /><br />
collected are married (86.7%). Cases of widowed were very low if not non-existence in some chiefdom.<br /><br />
With an exception of the Upper and Lower Banta Chiefdoms, where the number of widows was<br /><br />
reported (10.3 and 7.7% respectively), the remaining of the chiefdoms had no widows.<br /><br />
An overwhelming majority of respondents were heads of household while 14.8 percent were de jure<br /><br />
household heads that were either never married, were divorced or widowed female headed<br /><br />
households. Among the male respondents, the large majority (85.2%) were de facto heads of<br /><br />
households.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
An analysis of the educational status of respondents, which was defined in terms of different levels of<br /><br />
schooling are presented in Table A 3. There were considerable variations observed among respondents<br /><br />
regarding their educational attainment. In most cases some respondents cited more than one level of<br /><br />
education. In addition to formal schooling some also cited Koranic education. However, 60.1% of<br /><br />
respondents had no formal education (illiterate), 12.3% up to primary school and 10.4% up to secondary<br /><br />
level. Only a small proportion had attained tertiary education. This group comprised teachers and<br /><br />
employed members of staff residing in the chiefdoms. In general, this implies that many people in the<br /><br />
project area had limited opportunities to access income generating activities that demands educational<br /><br />
skills.<br /><br />
On average, a high proportion of respondents had a mean age of 55.6 years and a standard deviation of<br /><br />
15.7 years. Dasse, lower Banta had the highest number of aged respondents, while Kpanda Kemoh had<br /><br />
the lowest number.<br /><br />
Other household characteristics<br /><br />
Table A 4 provides information on other characteristics of household dwellings in the surveyed<br /><br />
communities, such as ownership, roofing, wall and flooring materials. An overwhelming majority of<br /><br />
respondents (94.4%) indicated that they owned house in their respective communities surveyed. The<br /><br />
type of roofing, wall and flooring materials can be viewed as an indicator of the quality of housing, a<br /><br />
dimension of wealth, as well as indicator of health risk.<br /><br />

The Table shows that 41.4% of houses have iron sheets roofing. A significant proportion of this<br /><br />
galvanized iron sheets roofing were found in Dasse (61.1%) followed by communities in the Upper Banta<br /><br />
chiefdoms; compared to 43.9% of surveyed communities in the Bumpe Chiefdom that had their roofing<br /><br />
materials made up of dilapidated thatched grass. For wall materials, 40.6% of surveyed communities<br /><br />
Floor materials like earth and sand pose a health problem because they may be a source of dust. They<br /><br />
are also more difficult to keep clean<br /><br />

1.2.1. Household Assets<br /><br />
In general, household asset ownership is low (Table A 5). Respondents were asked whether they own<br /><br />
physical household assets. The responses are presented at Table xxx. The results show that:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
70% (n=126) households have a radio with highest proportion in Kpanda Kemoh and Bumpe<br /><br />
chiefdoms. Interestingly, radios are owned only by the male headed households implying a low<br /><br />
asset base among female headed household members.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Slightly above half of the sampled households (53.9%) own a large pestle and mortar with high<br /><br />
proportion in communities in the Upper Banta chiefdoms. These are used for pounding food for<br /><br />
home consumption.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
74 households (41.1%) have mobile phones with highest in Kpanda Kemoh Chiefdom.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Nine households, all male headed, have a TV and a generator. Six of these reside in the Lower<br /><br />
Banta Chiefdom. These are not found in Upper Banta and Kpanda Kemoh Chiefdom.<br /><br />

Twelve households have a sewing machine, 4 of which are found in Upper Banta and Dasse<br /><br />
chiefdoms<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In all communities surveyed only 11 (male headed) households own a bike and five had<br /><br />
motorcycles.<br /><br />

1.2.2. Infrastructure: Roads<br /><br />
The road network was generally poor in most of the company’s operational areas. This is particularly<br /><br />
evident in many of the communities in Bumpe, Dasse and Upper Banta chiefdoms respectively. The<br /><br />
roads are inaccessible during the raining season and transport is difficult to obtain due to the bad nature<br /><br />
of the roads. Many people in the communities therefore either travel long distances on foot or by<br /><br />
bicycle or motorcycle (‘okada’). The roads in Kpanda Kemoh chiefdoms are preferably accessible all year<br /><br />
round.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Household drinking water<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To assess the socioeconomic conditions under which the population lives, respondents were asked to<br /><br />
give specific information about their household environment. The survey collected information about<br /><br />
drinking water, including the source, perceptions about the quality of drinking water, any treatment<br /><br />
prior to drinking and persons who usually collect the water. The source of drinking water is an indicator<br /><br />
of whether or not the water is suitable for drinking. Sources of water believed to be relatively free of<br /><br />
disease are improved sources such as piped water into dwelling units; public taps/standpipes, bore<br /><br />
holes, protected dug wells, protected spring and rainwater. Non improved sources, like unprotected dug<br /><br />
wells, unprotected springs, and surface water are more likely to have disease-causing agents that have a<br /><br />
negative impact on health.<br /><br />
Table xxx presents information on the drinking water of households at the chiefdom level of Vimetco<br /><br />
operational communities. With the exception of households in Kpanda Kemoh chiefdoms that obtain<br /><br />
drinking water from improved sources: 51.2% from tap and 41.5% from protected well/bore hole<br /><br />
respectively, more than sixty percent of the respondents obtains drinking water from non-improved<br /><br />
source: 26.1% from unprotected well/bore hole and 34.4% from river/streams.<br /><br />

1.3.1. Who Fetches Water<br /><br />
The traditional image of a woman as a mother and housewife underline a clear-cut division of labor<br /><br />
between men and women. Women perform the bulk of household work. Their domestic responsibilities<br /><br />
include food production, processing, preparation and storage as well as the provision of fuel and water,<br /><br />
sanitation, cleaning the house and laundry. Hence the role of fetching water as it has been revealed by<br /><br />
the respondents (men and women) is clearly the responsibility of women (48.9), men (5%), boys<br /><br />
(37.2%), girls (60.0%), women and girls 1.1%, However, men who do not have wives do the fetching of<br /><br />
water for themselves.<br /><br />

1.3.2. Sanitation facilities<br /><br />
Poor sanitation coupled with unsafe water sources increases the risk of water-borne diseases and<br /><br />
illnesses due to poor hygiene in the company’s operational areas. Studies have shown that the absence<br /><br />
of proper toilet facilities and improper disposal of faecal material increases exposure to the risk of<br /><br />
diseases like dysentery, diarrhoea, and typhoid fever. Members of households with improved sanitation<br /><br />
facilities are less likely to contract these communicable diseases.<br /><br />
Figure xxx shows that overall, 54.1% of households had no toilet facility available. This is so particularly<br /><br />
in communities in the Bumpe, Dasse and Kpanda Kemoh Chiefdoms respectively. Others in the Upper<br /><br />
Banta and Lower Banta reported to have access to toilet facility. The most common toilet facility is the<br /><br />
open pit latrines (93.7%), which is more likely to be used by majority of the households.<br /><br />

Economic activity<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Data collected on the main economic activity of household members is presented in table A 9. The Table<br /><br />
shows the limited opportunities available in the chiefdoms. In the communities surveyed, most adults<br /><br />
are engaged in agriculture in their own account as their primary and secondary economic activities. Very<br /><br />
few have business as their main economic activity. In upper Banta there is a greater possibility of<br /><br />
accessing formal employment than the rest of the chiefdoms were Vimetco operations are taking place.<br /><br />
Hunting and collection of forest products are not primary economic activity of any person but is an<br /><br />
important subsidiary in Lower Banta and Upper Banta respectively.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Data on the use of health facilities are presented in Table xxx below. These show that, overall, 84.9% of<br /><br />
survey households have some form of health care available in the communities. The health care service<br /><br />
provision is provided through the community health centres and clinics with wider provision available to<br /><br />
the population.<br /><br />

When asked whether they have used this health services in the community and for what purpose,<br /><br />
majority of the respondents answered in the affirmative. High levels of these households reported<br /><br />
members of their families had used the vaccination services but there is no information available as to<br /><br />
what vaccinations have been given or whether courses are completed. There have been strong<br /><br />
campaigns to increase vaccination in rural areas and this appears to have been successful.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A significant proportion of households also indicated using the antenatal check-ups for the number of<br /><br />
births in the survey villages. The high number of reported use of ante-natal check-ups indicates increase<br /><br />
awareness of the risk of home deliveries and high levels of hospital deliveries. Other households<br /><br />
reported that someone was sick.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Overall, 50.6% of households reported deaths. There is no historical data on sickness or deaths.<br /><br />
Registration of births and deaths is only possible in cities and is not universal even where possible.<br /><br />
Figure A 3 records the family stated cause of death – these reflects the lack of medical diagnosis, the<br /><br />
lack of autopsy facilities and prevalence of belief in witchcraft. There was no sufficient time to<br /><br />
investigate what people really understand by these records and this would make an interesting.<br /><br />

The study further revealed that most of the crops cultivated by farmers are local variety sourced from<br /><br />
market retailers, friends and relatives and proceeds from seed bank. There are instances in which NGOs<br /><br />
working in the communities of the operation area provides seeds to farmers for cultivation.<br /><br />

1.5.2. Average Land Size Owned and Used for Crop and ownership<br /><br />
by gender<br /><br />
Land is the basic resource depended upon by a majority of rural communities in Sierra Leone. The<br /><br />
amount of land owned and/or operated varies between communities’ dependence on the availability of<br /><br />
land resources and the nature of social structures governing access to land. In the selected villages of<br /><br />
the five chiefdoms, the average land size owned by individual households ranged from 1.1 to 3.5 ha with<br /><br />
the overall mean land size being 2.4 ha (Table A 21). The main use of the land is crop production. The<br /><br />
main crops that are being grown in these chiefdoms/villages are cassava and rice. In these chiefdoms,<br /><br />
the average land size set for cassava and rice range from 3.0 ha to 3.5 ha with an overall average being<br /><br />
3.25 ha.<br /><br />
In terms of ownership of crops grown by households, both the men and women in the households<br /><br />
participate in cultivation of these crops. The results show greater participation of the gender in crops<br /><br />
such as rice, cassava, groundnuts, vegetables and yam production. Agroforestry crop, such as oil palm,<br /><br />
cocoa and coffee, production activities is a mostly male dominated as reported by 58.1% of the<br /><br />
respondents. Also a significant proportion of the women are engaged in the production of beans and<br /><br />
benni seed.<br /><br />

Across chiefdoms, the overriding purpose of growing crops was for both cash income and household<br /><br />
food supplies. From the table above, overwhelming majority of respondents (92.3%) grow vegetables for<br /><br />
both cash income and household food; 85.3% groundnuts, 83.3% potatoes and 83.5% cassava. For<br /><br />
agroforestry crops, the survey households were divided for both income/cash earner and both.<br /><br />
However, agroforestry crops production were not found in Lower Banta, Bumpe and Dasse Chiefdoms.<br /><br />

1.5.3. Loss of land for agriculture and other purposes<br /><br />
Overall, 54.3% of household’s survey revealed that they are likely to affected by the loss of land to the<br /><br />
project, when compared to 45.7% of respondents who said no. The most obvious impacts of this loss of<br /><br />
land to agricultural include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Removal of vegetation cover, will severely alter the availability of food and loss of access to<br /><br />
common resources<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pose environmental and social challenge due to potential disruptions to ecosystems and local<br /><br />
communities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mud erosion on swamps will lead to loss of swamps<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Destroy livelihood activity<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Crop yields are affected due to declining soil productivity/soil fertility<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Loss of farmland will cause insecurity in farming<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.5.4. Farming system<br /><br />
Household respondents indicated the major farming systems commonly practiced in the<br /><br />
chiefdoms is mixed cropping (94.9%), mixed farming (80.8%) and sole cropping (57.1%).<br /><br />

not participate in community meetings revealed that it is as a result of the high level of poverty and<br /><br />
most times meetings are not called. Table A 27 presents the percentage of households having members<br /><br />
attending community work meetings of different types: many households attend more than one type of<br /><br />
meeting. Community gathering/meeting and social/religious work and club are the most commonly<br /><br />
attended. About 43% host political gathering and fewer communities are involved in community<br /><br />
construction works. The high rate declared for women’s attendance at community meeting is interesting<br /><br />
as the team has found that fewer women than men have been observed as attending community<br /><br />
consultation meetings relating the Vimetco Bauxite mining project.<br /><br />

Household perceptions of women’s participation (by contributing to decision making) were that an<br /><br />
overwhelming majority of them (96.4%) believed were able to participate in community meetings.<br /><br />
Overall, 63.7% of households believed that it was difficult for women to participate in meetings,<br /><br />
primarily because they had less time available, gender discrimination, farming activities and through<br /><br />
other work to do with childcare and domestic chores that prevented participation of women in<br /><br />
community/public meetings.<br /><br />

1.7.1. Community needs and concerns<br /><br />
The following common concerns were raised by considerable number of FGDs participants across the<br /><br />
concessionary zone:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The benefits received from the mining company is not commensurate to their needs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 162<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mining in the communities are done in an haphazard manner, especially in the Gbonge (Kpanda<br /><br />
Kemoh Chiefdom) and these was considered unacceptable as it is not economical and<br /><br />
environmentally friendly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Land owners are not involved in the negotiation process for their land;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Road network in their chiefdoms are deplorable<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lack of knowledge about the acreage assigned as concession zone for the mining operation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Agricultural Development Fund is not beneficial for the farmers; rather it is benefiting only the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
paramount chief and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security Officials.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Frequent delay in the payment of both surface rents and compensation for land and crop loss<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No positive impact on the socio-economic status of the affected communities – no alternative<br /><br />
<br /><br />
livelihood opportunities are not provided by the company<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No proper rehabilitation of mined areas with economic trees<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.7.2. Perceptions of Environmental Quality<br /><br />
There is no marked difference in the perceptions of the natural environment among the different<br /><br />
communities (figure A 4). Slightly more than sixty percent of the respondents (62.1%) had a negative<br /><br />
opinion about the environmental conditions of the operational communities in the last two years. An<br /><br />
overwhelming majority of respondents (97.2%) in Lower Banta felt that the quality of the environment is<br /><br />
very bad. In all, the communities expressed the deplorable status of health and sanitation hygiene<br /><br />
conditions, deforestation and soil degradation, pollution (air and noise) and health risk resulting from<br /><br />
dust emissions.<br /><br />

1.7.3. Problems with Vimetco operations<br /><br />
When survey respondents were asked whether there were any problems associated with Vimetco<br /><br />
operations in the area, the most commonly reported issue was pollution (mentioned by 87.8% of<br /><br />
respondents), dust (83.3% respondents) and noise (75.0% respondents).<br /><br />

1.7.4. Advantages of Vimetco operations<br /><br />
When asked whether there are any advantages of Vimetco presence in the area, the most commonly<br /><br />
named benefits were jobs, assistance to the community and benefits to the national economy.<br /><br />
However, small proportion of respondents felt that the company operations will not help provide an<br /><br />
improved infrastructure and facilities such as the road, utilities and recreational facilities; income<br /><br />
diversification opportunities and brighten and modernize the area (Figure A 6). The general perception<br /><br />
of the bauxite mining activities in the chiefdoms was viewed as a curse than a blessing. They said that<br /><br />
the mining activity has not contributed meaningfully to community development initiatives rather than<br /><br />
the destruction of the natural environment. To reverse this trend the community recommends a<br /><br />
thorough review of concession agreements reached to reflect mutual benefits for all relevant<br /><br />
stakeholders in the mining process.<br /><br />

ANNEX – C Summary of issues discussed in FGDs across the surveyed communities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. Loss of land used for agricultural and other purposes to bauxite mining by SMHL Vimetco<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The community members expressed willingness to loss their land used for agriculture and other purpose<br /><br />
to bauxite mining operations in their community. They indicated that this can only be possible provided<br /><br />
the following conditions are met by the company: increase surface rent and compensation; provide<br /><br />
training and employment opportunities for the community; provide improved and affordable medical<br /><br />
facilities and prompt and appropriate rehabilitation of the mined out areas for future use.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. Surface rent payments for mining land<br /><br />
The surface rents paid to community for mining land was viewed by all affected communities as too<br /><br />
small. While stakeholders generally clamour for the rate of surface rent payments to be increased, some<br /><br />
stakeholders believe that surface rents are disproportionately distributed amongst the different<br /><br />
stakeholder groups. Some argue that the percentage for the Paramount Chiefs is too large; others<br /><br />
believe Local Councils are getting the lion’s share. Some stakeholders would like the involvement of all<br /><br />
stakeholders in deciding the level of surface rent payments. In a focus group discussions or discussion<br /><br />
meetings, the communities expressed that most times these amounts are paid annually and untimely<br /><br />
and often the indirect payments are too bureaucratic. The distribution of surface payment rents across<br /><br />
the communities interviewed is as shown in the table below. Note that while the payment rates are<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 166<br /><br />
<br /><br />
established by law, the distribution is determined in consultations among the GOSL (mainly the MLGCD),<br /><br />
Chiefs and Local Councils, although it is not clear how a final decision is made. There is concern that<br /><br />
decisions are made in a subjective and non-transparent manner for the distribution of surface rent<br /><br />
payment. The communities indicated that there is a need to re-negotiate the amount paid per annual<br /><br />
per acre of land and increase on the current amount paid and these monies are to be paid monthly, and<br /><br />
that direct payment should be made to the landowners themselves.<br /><br />

3. Relocation of villages<br /><br />
The entire affected villages/communities are unwilling to relocate to another community. They however<br /><br />
expressed dissatisfaction over the current status of relocated villages/communities. The participation of<br /><br />
affected people is limited not only because stakeholders are not actively involved in the discussions on<br /><br />
relocation but, more importantly, there is no assessment of the changes in lifestyles and capacities<br /><br />
needed to overcome successfully a major disruption of local families. Participants in a focus group<br /><br />
discussion indicate that in any future village relocation, the company should build modern structures<br /><br />
and provide all socio-cultural structures (such as place of worship, educational and health facilities etc.),<br /><br />
renegotiate compensation fees and provide relief services to the people in the relocated village(s) for<br /><br />
the first three consecutive years after relocation.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
4. Compensation payment and method<br /><br />
The factors that should determine the level of compensation payment for crops destroyed due to<br /><br />
mining activities are:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Adopt a procedure to determine the cost of crops/assets involved. This should be done in close<br /><br />
consultation with landowners.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Negotiate directly with the landowner and reach consensus on the amount.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Amount of payment should be commensurate to the crop/asset destroyed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Develop a framework for compensation payment with the involvement of the local<br /><br />
communities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Although ministry officials are involved in the crop compensation exercise, crop owners would like the<br /><br />
economic life of the crops to be considered in the evaluation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5. Economic and Community Development issues<br /><br />
So far the company has provided the following benefits as reported by the affected communities:<br /><br />
community Barry, good road network, secondary school in the chiefdom, and improved medical<br /><br />
facilities. The participants in the focus group meetings said that the community should address their<br /><br />
concerns; the most common response was to assist with improving community infrastructure and<br /><br />
facilities such as the road, utilities, and recreational facilities. Other recommendations that the company<br /><br />
should provide training for community members provide information on job opportunities and services<br /><br />
and adhere to the highest standards for environmental protection.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6. Contribution of mining to national economy<br /><br />
The general perception of the bauxite mining activities in the chiefdoms was viewed as a curse than a<br /><br />
blessing. They said that the mining activity has not contributed meaningfully to community development<br /><br />
initiatives rather than the destruction of the natural environment. To reverse this trend the community<br /><br />
recommends a thorough review of concession agreements reached to reflect mutual benefits for all<br /><br />
relevant stakeholders in the mining process.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
7. Health and Environmental Sanitation Problems:<br /><br />
The communities expressed deplorable status of the health and sanitation hygiene condition of their<br /><br />
communities. The major environmental, health and sanitation concerns resulting from the mining in the<br /><br />
community includes:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pollution<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Erosion<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Deforestation and soil degradation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Noise<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Dust<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Health problems – malaria, diarrhoea, high blood pressure and problems associated with ageing.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Problem of sanitation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To resolve these problems, the following measures were proposed:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Reduce dust emissions using appropriate measures<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Develop soil erosion prevention plan<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Rehabilitate mined out areas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provide improved and affordable medical facilities for communities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provision and maintenance of improved road network in the community<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8. Increase in crime rate<br /><br />
The most common crime in the communities identified by focus group participants are:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Thieving<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Prostitution<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Disregard for local authorities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9. Issues related to safety and accidents<br /><br />
The major safety and accidents problems reported by the FGDs participants include:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Boulders rolling from haulers/dumper trucks<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The creation of dams/ponds that does not support aqua-culture due to high concentration of<br /><br />
harmful chemicals<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Persistence dust emissions thereby increasing the possibilities of frequent accidents. For<br /><br />
example two accidents reported occurred in Gbonge and Badja respectively<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 169<br /><br />
<br /><br />
With the establishment of Environment and Safety Management within the corporate environment,<br /><br />
health, occupational and safety issues are vigorously addressed. No serious incident of occupational<br /><br />
hazards and safety problems were reported resulting from the dredging operation at the moment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10. Community concerns and needs<br /><br />
The following common concerns were raised by considerable number of FGDs participants across the<br /><br />
concessionary zone:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The benefits received from the mining company is not commensurate to their needs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mining in the communities are done in a haphazard manner, especially in the Gbonge (Kpanda<br /><br />
Kemoh Chiefdom) and these was considered unacceptable as it is not economical and<br /><br />
environmentally friendly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Land owners are not involved in the negotiation process for their land;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Road network in their chiefdoms are deplorable<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lack of knowledge about the acreage assigned as concession zone for the mining operation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Agricultural Development Fund is not beneficial for the farmers; rather it is benefiting only the<br /><br />
paramount chief and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security Officials.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Frequent delay in the payment of both surface rents and compensation for land and crop loss<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No positive impact on the socio-economic status of the affected communities – no alternative<br /><br />
livelihood opportunities are not provided by the company<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No proper rehabilitation of mined areas with economic trees<br /><br />
