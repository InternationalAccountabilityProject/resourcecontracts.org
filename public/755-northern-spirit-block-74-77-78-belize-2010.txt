Valuation and Measurement of Petroleum<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1	<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Crude oil sold by the Contractor to third parties shall be valued at the net realized<br /><br />
price at the delivery point received by the Contractor for such crude oil.<br /><br />
For purposes of this paragraph, "net realized price" means the price realized at<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the delivery point as calculated by adjusting the price actually received at the<br /><br />
point of sale with allowable deductions. In calculating the net realized price,<br /><br />
deductions may only be made for (a) transportation costs between the delivery<br /><br />
point and the point of sale, (b) commissions and brokerages, and (c) handling<br /><br />
charges; and the deductions shall be limited to amounts that do not exceed<br /><br />
customary and prevailing rates charged therefor in the international oil industry<br /><br />
between independent parties in ann's length commercial transactions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2	 Crude oil sold by the Contractor to other than third parties shall be valued as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2.1 By using the weighted average unit price received by the Contractor from sales to<br /><br />
third parties at the delivery point, net of any commissions and brokerages paid in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
relation to such third party sales, during the ninety (90) days preceding such sale,<br /><br />
adjusted as necessary for quality, grade and gravity, and taking into<br /><br />
consideration any special circumstances with respect to such sales, unless less<br /><br />
<br /><br />
than fifty percent (50%), by volume, of crude oil sales during such period are<br /><br />
made to third parties, in which case crude oil sold to other than third parties shall<br /><br />
be valued in accordance with paragraph 10.2.2.<br /><br />
10.2.2 If no third party sales have been made during such period of time, then <a} on the<br /><br />
basis used to value other crude oil from Belize of similar quality, grade and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
gravity (or, if not similar, adjusted as necessary for quality, grade and gravity) and<br /><br />
taking	 into consideration any special circumstances with respect to sales of such<br /><br />
<br /><br />
crude oil, or (b) if there is no other crude oil from Belize, on the basis used to<br /><br />
value crude oil from other sources in the Central America, Colombia and<br /><br />
Venezuela of similar quality, grade and gravity and taking into consideration any<br /><br />
special circumstances with respect to sales of such similar crude oiL<br /><br />

10.4	 Third party sales referred to in this Article shall mean sales other than barter<br /><br />
sales made by the Contractor to purchasers that are not affiliated companies of<br /><br />
the Contractor in arm's length transactions and with whom (at the time the same<br /><br />
is made) the Contractor has no contractual interest involving directly or indirectly<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any joint interest.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10,5	 The Contractor shall, prior to initial commercial production in any field, carry out<br /><br />
an assay of the crude oil from such field for its valuation and shall promptly<br /><br />
submit the results of such assay to the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.6	 In the event that petroleum operations involve the segregation of crude oils of<br /><br />
different quality, grade or gravity, and if the parties do not otherwise mutually<br /><br />
agree, any and all provisions of this Agreement concerning valuation of crude oil<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall separately apply to each segregated crude oil. However, in electing to take<br /><br />
crude oil for internal consumption pursuant to paragraph 11.7 and to take royalty<br /><br />
in kind pursuant to paragraph 11.2, the Government shall have the right to<br /><br />
receive, crude oil of the quality, grade and gravity of its choice.<br /><br />
10.7	 The Contractor shall supply, operate and rnaintain equipment for measuring the<br /><br />
volume and quality of the petroleum produced and saved hereunder, including<br /><br />
gravity, density, temperature and pressure measuring devices and any other<br /><br />
<br /><br />
devices that may be reqUired. All measurement eqUipment and devices shall,<br /><br />
prior to their installation or usage, be approved by the Inspector of Petroleum.<br /><br />
Such eqUipment and devices shall at all reasonabie times be available for<br /><br />
inspection and testing by the Inspector of PetrOleum or other authorized<br /><br />
representatives. Any such inspection or testing shall not interfere with the normal<br /><br />
operation of the facilities involved. The eqUipment and devices used or installed<br /><br />
pursuant to this paragraph shall not be replaced or altered without the prior<br /><br />
approval of the Government.<br /><br />
10.8	 The Contractor shall undertake to measure the volume and quality of the<br /><br />
petroleum produced and saved hereunder, consistent with generally accepted<br /><br />
practices in the international petroleum industry, with the frequency and<br /><br />
according to procedures which shall be approved by the Government.<br /><br />
10.9	 The Contractor shall give the Inspector of Petroleum timely notice of its intention<br /><br />
to conduct measuring operations and the Inspector shall have the right to be<br /><br />

present at and supervise, either directly or through authorized representatives,<br /><br />
such operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.10	 If it is determined, following an inspeelion or test carried out by the Government<br /><br />
or its representatives, that the equipment. devices or procedures used for<br /><br />
measurement are inaccurate and exceed the permissible tolerances which shall<br /><br />
<br /><br />
be established by agreement between the Government and the Contraelor, and<br /><br />
such determination is verified by an independent surveyor acceptable to both<br /><br />
parties, such inaccuracy shall be deemed to have existed for one-half of the<br /><br />
period since the last previous such inspection or test, unless it is proved that such<br /><br />
inaccuracy has been in existence for a longer or shorter period. Appropriate<br /><br />
<br /><br />
adjustments covering such period shall be made within thirty (30) days from the<br /><br />
date of such determination.<br /><br />

so notify the Contraelor in writing not less than sixty (60) days prior to the<br /><br />
commencement of each six month semester of each calendar year specifying the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
quantity, and designating the grade and quality that it elects to take in kind,<br /><br />
based upon estimates, including those contained in the forecast statement<br /><br />
furnished pursuant to paragraph 6.3.2. Final adjustments shall be made within<br /><br />
ninety (gO) days of the end of each calendar year on the basis of aelual<br /><br />
quantities. Such notice shall be effective for the ensuing six month semester of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
that calendar year. Failure to give such notice shall be conclusively deemed to<br /><br />
indicate the eleelion by the Government not to take in kind.<br /><br />
11.3	 Any sale by the Contractor of any part of the Govemment's share of crude oil<br /><br />
produelion shall not be for a term expiring more than six (6) months after the date<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the Government so consents. the Government shall not exercise its rights to<br /><br />
receive crude oil in kind pursuant to paragraph 11.2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.4	 Any sale by the Contractor of any part of its share of the crude oil produced and<br /><br />
saved from the contract area shall not be for a term expiring more than twelve<br /><br />
(12) months after the date of execution of the sales contract without the<br /><br />
Govemment's written consent. If the Government so consents, the Government<br /><br />
shall not exercise its rights under paragraph 11.7 to require the Contractor to<br /><br />
satisfy	 the internal consumption requirements of Belize from crude oil which is<br /><br />
subject to such contract.<br /><br />

11.5	 Crude oil which the Govemment has elected to take in kind shall be delivered by<br /><br />
the Contractor, free of cost to the Govemment, at regularty spaced intervals at<br /><br />
the delivery point or to the Government's storage facilities in the field, or both, at<br /><br />
the option of the Govemment. The Govemment shall provide at such delivery<br /><br />
points, at its sole expense, all storage, transportation and other facilities<br /><br />
necessary to receive such crude oil, provided, however, that if the Government<br /><br />
requests, the Contractor shall provide adequate storage facilities at such places,<br /><br />
free of charge, at the risk of the Govemment, for a quantity of the Govemment's<br /><br />
crude oil not exceeding one hundred thousand (100,000) barrels for each field. If<br /><br />
storage exceeds one hundred thousand (100,000) barrels per field at any time,<br /><br />
the Govemment shall pay to the Contractor a reasonable storage charge for such<br /><br />
excess.<br /><br />
11.6	 If the Govemment elects to meet all or part of the requirements of the domestic<br /><br />
market of Belize from crude oil production in Belize, it shall use its share of<br /><br />
production from all crude oil production in Belize to do so. If in any year there is<br /><br />
domestic demand in excess of the Government's share of such production, the<br /><br />
Government may require the Contractor to sell crude oil in Belize on a pro rata<br /><br />
basis with other producers in Belize, according to the quantity of crude oil<br /><br />
production of each producer in each year. The Government shall give the<br /><br />
Contractor at least three (3) months notice in advance of such requirement and<br /><br />
the term of supply will be on an annual basis. The price for such sales shall be<br /><br />
the price as calculated pursuant to paragraph 10.2 above.<br /><br />
