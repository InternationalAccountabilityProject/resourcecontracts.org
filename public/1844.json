The Exploration Period of 9 years is divided into 3 consecutive phases of 4, 3 and 2 years respectively. In Phase 1, Kosmos' Minimum Work Obligations are to: reprocess all 2D seismic data across Block 42; conduct 2D seismic survey of at least 1400 km and 3D seismic survey of at least 500 km; conduct geological analysis and evaluation of Contract Area data supplied to Kosmos as detailed in art. 21.2. In each of Phases 2 and 3, Kosmos has a Minimum Work Obligation to drill at least 1 well and conduct geological analysis and evaluation of Contract Area data. At the end of phases 1 and 2, Kosmos has the option of withdrawing from the Contract and must report its election to Staatsolie at least 60 days prior to the end of the phase. The estimated cost for Minimum Work Obligation will be: $5 Million in Phase 1, $85 Million in Phase 2 and $100 Million in Phase 3. Kosmos must notify Staatsolie within 60 days of completion of its Minimum Work Obligations and Staatsolie must confirm receipt of notice within 30 days. If Staatsolie does not provide written dispute regarding completion within 30 days of Kosmos' notification, the Minimum Work Obligation is deemed complete. If Staatsolie does dispute Kosmos' completion notification, it must provided detailed written objection which if the parties are unable to reach amicable resolution may be referred to dispute resolution as detailed in art. 41.  Work in excess of the Minimum Work Obligation is carried forward and credited against Minimum Work Obligations in subsequent phases. If Minimum Work Obligations are not complete at the end of a phase, Kosmos (or its parent) shall pay Staatsolie the difference between: (i) the estimated cost of the Minimum Work Obligation for the Phase and (ii) Kosmos' exploration expenditures up to the date Staatsolie received notice of Kosmos' withdrawal. --Art. 3.2, art. 5",
