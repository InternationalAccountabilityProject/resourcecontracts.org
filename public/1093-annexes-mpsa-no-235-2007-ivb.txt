        The climate sustains lush and diversified fauna. The high relief of Berong is            <br /><br /><br />
        mostly covered with dense forest growth of commercial grade hardwoods and                <br /><br /><br />
        softwoods. Secondary growth in the timbered area is extremely dense consisting           <br /><br /><br />
        of bamboo, thomed bushes and a wide variety of vines. The laterite bearing areas         <br /><br /><br />
        are noticeably covered with dense but stunted growth hardwoods.                          <br /><br /><br />

        forestland. The nature of the soil being iron-rich lateritic, is not conducive for       <br /><br /><br />

6.0 Description of Exploration Work Program:                                                     <br /><br /><br />
Laterite deposits exploration in Central Palawan dates back to mid-1967, pioneered by the        <br /><br /><br />
exploration group of A. Soriano y Cia, the forerunner of ANSCOR. Extensive exploration           <br /><br /><br />
works were done in Central Palawan until 1989 where test pitting delineated extensive            <br /><br /><br />
nickel laterite/saprolite resources in Long Point, Moorsom, Berong and Tagkawayan                <br /><br /><br />
areas. Test pitting at Berong included 2,574 test pits, of which 158 were at 300 m spacing,      <br /><br /><br />
993 were at 50 meter spacing and 804 were at 25 meter spacing.                                   <br /><br /><br />
A review of test pitting results and assays at Berong from more closely-spaced test pits (at     <br /><br /><br />
50 m spacing or better), a calculated what was called “proven reserve” of 5.4 million            <br /><br /><br />
tones grading 1.26% Ni and 0.16% Co in laterite and 12.2 million tones in saprolite              <br /><br /><br />
grading 1.68% Ni and 0.046% Co. The currently accepted terminology would be                      <br /><br /><br />
“indicated mineral resources” for this mineralization.                                           <br /><br /><br />
The amended exploration work program is focused now in exploring and developing the              <br /><br /><br />
property and synthesized into a commercial mining operation.                                     <br /><br /><br />

The contract area is known to contain nickel and cobalt mineralization in the form                            <br /><br /><br />
of laterite and saprolite. The nickel in the laterite is associated with hydrated iron                        <br /><br /><br />
oxides made up essentially of goethite.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
Gamierite also occurs in the contract area within and below the laterite mantle. It                           <br /><br /><br />
correlates well with abrupt increase in the nickel content of the laterite.                                   <br /><br /><br />

 of tropical soils (residual) overlying iron-rich lateritic material/saprolite                    <br /><br /><br />
 which in turn overlies the bedrock. The geological mapping conducted by                          <br /><br /><br />
 previous workers indicates primary intrusive (ultramafic) or ophiolite rock                      <br /><br /><br />
 (basalt, gabbro, peridotite and dunite) towards the central portion of the                       <br /><br /><br />
 island and in the vicinity of the Project Area (Figure 2). These types of                        <br /><br /><br />
 ophiolitic rock formations are expected to be quite competent unless                             <br /><br /><br />
 highly weathered in situ.                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
 Towards the coastal regions, published geological mapping identifies                             <br /><br /><br />
 older metasedimentary rocks consist of chert, quartzite, schist with quartz                      <br /><br /><br />
 lens intrusion.                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 The coastal plains downstream from the uplands are expected to be                                <br /><br /><br />
 overlain by alluvium, comprising mainly silts, sands, gravels and cobbles.                       <br /><br /><br />
 The thickness of the alluvium appears to be substantially greater beneath                        <br /><br /><br />
 the coastal lowlands to the south of Berong River but no drilling data is                        <br /><br /><br />
 presently available.                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
 4.4.2    Mineralization: Morphology of Nickeliferous Laterite                                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 Nickeliferous laterite is the end product of the tropical weathering of                          <br /><br /><br />
 ultramafic rocks, mainly the olivine bearing dunite and harzburgite. The                         <br /><br /><br />
 mineral olivine is the principal progenitor of nickel where the metal                            <br /><br /><br />
 occurs only as a minor constituent in the crystal lattice.                                       <br /><br /><br />

               Typical weathering characterized by high humidity and temperature               <br /><br /><br />
               breaks down the complex mineralogical structures of the ultramafic rocks        <br /><br /><br />
               into their elemental components. Consequently, new minerals and                 <br /><br /><br />
               chemical complexes are formed which are stable in the oxygenated                <br /><br /><br />
               environment e.g. iron oxides, aluminium oxides and clay minerals.               <br /><br /><br />
               Unstable species such as silica and magnesia are leached out from the           <br /><br /><br />
               system. Minor elements such as nickel and cobalt are incorporated with          <br /><br /><br />
               the stable species and together become enriched in the residuum.                <br /><br /><br />
               As the weathering process progresses downward, the redistribution of the        <br /><br /><br />
               liberated rock components produces compositional layering as shown on           <br /><br /><br />
               the idealized vertical profile. The distinctive reddish-brown to yellow         <br /><br /><br />
               brown limonitic upper layers constitute the true laterite overlying the pale,   <br /><br /><br />
               greenish-grey, highly weathered ultramafic rock (called saprolite) that         <br /><br /><br />
               grades down to the parent unweathered rocks.                                    <br /><br /><br />
               Mature laterite deposits normally exhibit distinct to subtle layers             <br /><br /><br />
               distinguishable by colour variations as well as the presence of common          <br /><br /><br />
               minerals such as chromite and magnetite.                                        <br /><br /><br />
               Significant accumulations of laterites to tens of meters occur in places        <br /><br /><br />

               subsequent accumulation is therefore governed by a favourable                   <br /><br /><br />

 In general, the Philippines is located along the Circum-Pacific Seismic Belt where            <br /><br /><br />
 more than 80% of the world’s earthquakes occur. Philippine seismicity is mainly               <br /><br /><br />
 related to the crustal underthrusting along several subduction zones and partly to            <br /><br /><br />
 strike-slip movement along the transcurrent faults. Earthquakes are generally                 <br /><br /><br />
 shallow near the ocean trenches and progressively go deeper landward to a                     <br /><br /><br />
 maximum of 700 km in depth.                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
 The Philippine Seismic Zone Map (Figure 3) is presented on the next page                      <br /><br /><br />
 showing the relationship of seismicity to the subduction zones. The National                  <br /><br /><br />
 Structural Code classifies Palawan as Zone II. The available earthquake records               <br /><br /><br />
 indicate that Palawan Island is a relatively “quieter” zone of seismic activity               <br /><br /><br />
 compared to the rest of the Philippines, and there has been no recent documented              <br /><br /><br />
 seismic activity on the island.                                                               <br /><br /><br />

 the insect larvae, a chironomid, Camptocladius byssinus, was the most                             <br /><br /><br />

 Aquatic insects, particularly the larval forms, are excellent overall                             <br /><br /><br />
 indicators of aquatic environmental conditions. For instance, the order                           <br /><br /><br />
 Diptera (midges) is generally known to be tolerant of higher pollution as                         <br /><br /><br />
 they occupy the full spectrum of habitats and conditions in streams and                           <br /><br /><br />
 lakes. The large numbers of the chironomid Camptocladius byssinus                                 <br /><br /><br />
 indicate an environment under some level of pollution mainly at the                               <br /><br /><br />
 downstream section of the Berong River. Only chironomid dipterans                                 <br /><br /><br />

                     inhabitants are a mixture of settlers (mostly from the Ilonggo-speaking                      <br /><br /><br />

                     (80% of households) in Quezon town. Barangay Berong, in turn, has                            <br /><br /><br />

                     below the subsistence threshold level at 97%. This observation is                            <br /><br /><br />
                     confirmed in BNC-initiated socio-economic surveys, which revealed                            <br /><br /><br />

                     associated with the Tagbanuas. For example, the survey reveals that                          <br /><br /><br />
                     the average monthly cash income of Tagbanua households is less than                          <br /><br /><br />
                     half of settler counterparts. In other words, settler households tend to                     <br /><br /><br />
                     be better, twice over in income than households of indigenous                                <br /><br /><br />

 exploration group of A. Soriano y Cia, the forerunner of ANSCOR. Extensive exploration                                  <br /><br /><br />
 works were done in Central Palawan until 1989 where test pitting delineated extensive                                   <br /><br /><br />
 nickel laterite/saprolite resources in Long Point, Moorsom, Berong and Tagkawayan                                       <br /><br /><br />
 areas. Test pitting at Berong included 2,574 test pits, of which 158 were at 300 m spacing,                             <br /><br /><br />
 993 were at 50 meter spacing and 804 were at 25 meter spacing.                                                          <br /><br /><br />

               12.1.1.7 Construction of Campsites                                                   <br /><br /><br />
               The exploration team constructed a house at the edge of the                          <br /><br /><br />
               Project Area. Minor clearing is needed for camp construction.                        <br /><br /><br />
               12.2 Hydrology and Water Quality                                                     <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
               12.2.1    Potential generation of acid mine drainage                                 <br /><br /><br />
               The generation of acid mine drainage occurs when sulfide deposits are                <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
               oxidized by the action of water and air that produces acidic run-off. Since          <br /><br /><br />
               the exploration work is targeting lateritic deposit, no substantial acid mine        <br /><br /><br />
               drainage is expected because the soils are extensively naturally weathered.          <br /><br /><br />
               12.2.2    Siltation and Pollution of Surface Waters                                  <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
               It is expected that minor siltation and pollution of surface waters may              <br /><br /><br />
               occur especially when constructing access roads, drill sites and sumps for           <br /><br /><br />
               the drilling operations. Maintenance activity shall be carried out regularly         <br /><br /><br />
               particularly in handling, control and/or proper disposal of hazardous                <br /><br /><br />
               materials (fuel and lubricants), drill muds and industrial refuse.                   <br /><br /><br />
               12.2.3    Changes in Water Availability and Quality and Drainage Pattern Due         <br /><br /><br />
               to Construction of Water Storage Areas, etc.                                         <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
               Water availability and drainage pattern will not be affected by the                  <br /><br /><br />
               exploration activities. There will be no massive clearing of vegetation to           <br /><br /><br />
               be undertaken in the Project Area. Small patches of shrubs and grass                 <br /><br /><br />
               cover will be uprooted during construction of access roads and drill sites,          <br /><br /><br />
               if necessary, but will be replanted after usage.                                     <br /><br /><br />
               The Berong and Aramaywan Rivers and their tributaries provide the                    <br /><br /><br />
               drainage to the Project Area. The quality of water will not be affected by           <br /><br /><br />
               the above mentioned activity because strategically located sumps and                 <br /><br /><br />
               dams will be installed to eliminate siltation of drainage channels.                  <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 12.3 Potential Effects on the Ecology                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 The effects of the exploration activities on ecology, as a whole, are insignificant                <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 and temporary. There may be some clearing and uprooting of shrubs and bushes                       <br /><br /><br />
 during the site preparation for test pits and drill sites. Such will be temporary ,                <br /><br /><br />
 will be back-filled and reforested to restore to near original condition.                          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 12.4 Potential Effects on the Socio-Economic Environment                                           <br /><br /><br />
 Base line data on the existing socio-economic status in the area have already been                 <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 established and were fully discussed in the project’s EIS. The studies included                    <br /><br /><br />
 the culture and tradition of indigenous communities in the region.                                 <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 However, the usual impacts of exploration are positive and are based on:                           <br /><br /><br />

13.0 Environmental Management Measures                                                  <br /><br /><br />
13.1    Progressive rehabilitation/restoration of areas subject of exploration          <br /><br /><br />
disturbance and related activities by reforestation or by undertaking civil             <br /><br /><br />
structure programs such as rip-rap, retaining walls, etc., to prevent erosion           <br /><br /><br />
and siltation.                                                                          <br /><br /><br />
13.1.1 Revegetation                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
All disturbed areas will be assisted to regenerate or be revegetated upon               <br /><br /><br />
completion of use. Vegetation established should be in harmony with the                 <br /><br /><br />
surrounding vegetation and local species will be cultivated in a nursery for            <br /><br /><br />
supply of replanting stock.                                                             <br /><br /><br />
13.2    Management of stockpile of excavated and removed earth, if any, to prevent      <br /><br /><br />
dust and siltation problems (e.g., revegetation of disposal areas) and reduce           <br /><br /><br />
the impact of topographical changes.                                                    <br /><br /><br />
Any land disturbed during the exploration activity will be revegetated to allow         <br /><br /><br />
regenerating similar to the adjacent land. Revegetation of disturbed areas will be      <br /><br /><br />
done upon completion of use.                                                            <br /><br /><br />
All test pits dug will be back-filled covered by the same soil material taken from      <br /><br /><br />
it after completion of the exploration program. This will prevent living creatures      <br /><br /><br />
from falling into the pit. If the pits need to be maintained for future re-sampling,    <br /><br /><br />
re-mapping or any other necessary studies, the pits will be fenced off to avoid         <br /><br /><br />
accidents to human and animals alike.                                                   <br /><br /><br />
13.3    Maintenance of Roads                                                            <br /><br /><br />
Existing roads will be used whenever possible. New road/track access (if                <br /><br /><br />
construction is required) will be kept to a minimum. Maintenance activity on the        <br /><br /><br />
roads will be carried out. Any spillage of hazardous materials like oil, fuel, drill    <br /><br /><br />
muds and industrial refuse on the road shall be collected for proper disposal off       <br /><br /><br />
site.                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
13.4    Solid Waste Disposal                                                            <br /><br /><br />
An existing base camp will be utilized for employee's accommodation. Solid              <br /><br /><br />
waste generated from the camp will be disposed properly by implementing waste           <br /><br /><br />
segregation scheme. Proper sewerage system will be employed to handle human             <br /><br /><br />

 The pits will be covered with soil when full. Non-biodegradable waste shall be         <br /><br /><br />
 brought out of the site for disposal at the Municipality’s designated dumpsite.        <br /><br /><br />
 13.5    Handling of Toxic and Hazardous Materials, if any, Including an Emergency      <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                        <br /><br /><br />

 Maintenance activity should be carried out such that spillage of hazardous             <br /><br /><br />
 materials like oil, fuel, drill muds and industrial refuse shall be collected for      <br /><br /><br />
 proper disposal off site.                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 13.6    Accommodation of Other Economic Activities in the Area.                        <br /><br /><br />
 Economic development programs in the community will be encouraged to the               <br /><br /><br />
 extent of providing assistance to locals in developing livelihood projects that will   <br /><br /><br />
 both benefit the community and the project proponent. If drilling commences, the       <br /><br /><br />
 fabrication of core drill boxes using indigenous materials will be funded by the       <br /><br /><br />
 Project Proponent as one type of community livelihood project.                         <br /><br /><br />
 13.7    Alternative Plan if Special Habitat of Flora and Fauna Are Affected.           <br /><br /><br />
 Preservation plans and measures of identified endangered species will be done in       <br /><br /><br />
 coordination with the proper government agencies like the DENR-PAWB,                   <br /><br /><br />
 DENR-CENRO, etc.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />

 Including Compensation Measures, If Necessary.                                         <br /><br /><br />
 A periodic educational and information campaign shall be undertaken to                 <br /><br /><br />
 inform the affected communities, particularly the Indigenous Peoples,                  <br /><br /><br />
 regarding the progress of the exploration program. Landowners, if any,                 <br /><br /><br />
 will be compensated for any land use or disturbance like drilling (they are            <br /><br /><br />
 given the option to work for the company during a particular activity on               <br /><br /><br />
 their land.)                                                                           <br /><br /><br />
 The company will closely coordinate with the LGU of Quezon, PCSD,                      <br /><br /><br />
