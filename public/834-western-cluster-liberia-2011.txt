and Section 5.1(b) is delivered to the Minister on or before the expiration     <br /><br /><br />
of the Exploration Period of the Exploration License, then such                 <br /><br /><br />
Exploration License shall automatically terminate without requirement of        <br /><br /><br />
action by the Minister or the Government. For the avoidance of doubt, the       <br /><br /><br />
termination of any single Exploration License shall not affect the              <br /><br /><br />
Company’s right to carry on Exploration and Operations in connection            <br /><br /><br />
with the remaining Exploration Areas or Production Areas, as the case           <br /><br /><br />
may be. that are not covered by the Exploration License so terminated. If       <br /><br /><br />
all of the Exploration Licenses have been terminated pursuant to this           <br /><br /><br />
Section 5.1, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate without          <br /><br /><br />
requirement of action by the Minister or the Government.                        <br /><br /><br />
Each Proposed Production Area (i) shall consist of such part of the             <br /><br /><br />
Exploration Area as in the light of Internationa! Mining Standards is           <br /><br /><br />
reasonable, taking into account the extent and nature of the Iron Ore or        <br /><br /><br />
other Mineral constituting Mineral Resources, for the mining and recovery       <br /><br /><br />
of such Mineral Resources, including the Retained Production Areas, and         <br /><br /><br />
(ii) shall form a compact block as much as possible, with the borders           <br /><br /><br />
aligned to the true north-south and east-west. A Proposed Production Area       <br /><br /><br />
may not include Land (i) located within the boundaries of any cities,           <br /><br /><br />
commonwealth districts, municipal districts, cemeteries, transportation or      <br /><br /><br />
communication facilities, aqueducts, military base, port, Poro or Sande         <br /><br /><br />
grounds, and other grounds reserved for public purposes, except with the        <br /><br /><br />
consent of the officials authorized to administer or control the affairs of     <br /><br /><br />

as may be prescribed for the protection of surface users; (ii) the use of      <br /><br /><br />
which for Mining operations would violate Section 10.1 of the Mining           <br /><br /><br />
Law; or (iii) as otherwise reasonably agreed by the parties. A Proposed        <br /><br /><br />
Production Area may not include surface areas other than the surface           <br /><br /><br />
above the Iron Ore constituting Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources       <br /><br /><br />
and any additional Land reasonably required for the extraction from the        <br /><br /><br />
earth of such resources. If other land is required to facilitate the           <br /><br /><br />
processing of extracted Iron Ore, the disposition of waste materials or        <br /><br /><br />
other activities not constituting actual extraction, the Company may           <br /><br /><br />
acquire that land as provided in Section 7,3.                                  <br /><br /><br />
(c)    The Company shall submit to the Government, within 60 days following    <br /><br /><br />
the notice given under Section 5.1(a), detailed maps for each Proposed         <br /><br /><br />
Production Area covered by such notice, based on actual surveys using the      <br /><br /><br />
most current technology, that, with respect to a Proposed Production Area,     <br /><br /><br />
set forth the boundaries and coordinates of the area containing the deposits   <br /><br /><br />
from which Iron Ore is expected to be Mined. The maps shall be of such         <br /><br /><br />
scale and contain such detail, including geographical and topographical        <br /><br /><br />
information, (x) as may reasonably be necessary to identify accurately the     <br /><br /><br />
boundaries of the Iron Ore constituting Indicated and Inferred Mineral         <br /><br /><br />
Resources within such Proposed Production Area and (y) as may otherwise        <br /><br /><br />
reasonably be required by the Liberian Geological Survey for the mapping       <br /><br /><br />
.....    of such Proposed Production Area.                                     <br /><br /><br />
(d)    If the Company wishes to carry out additional Exploration within a      <br /><br /><br />
Proposed Production Area it may do so, provided that the work is covered       <br /><br /><br />
by an exploration work program that has been approved under the terms of       <br /><br /><br />
the Exploration Regulations. No budget or annual expenditure                   <br /><br /><br />
requirements apply to such work, but all other provisions of the               <br /><br /><br />
Exploration Regulations as to the manner of carrying out such work and as      <br /><br /><br />
to reporting the results of such work remain applicable.                       <br /><br /><br />

been cured to the reasonable satisfaction of, or waived by, the               <br /><br /><br />
Minister), and (y) the Company is prepared to develop the Mine,               <br /><br /><br />
Mining Plant and Infrastructure in the manner set forth in the                <br /><br /><br />
Feasibility Report (other than as may reasonably be required to               <br /><br /><br />
respond to facts and circumstances not known to the Company at                <br /><br /><br />
the time the Feasibility Report was Filed), and setting forth the             <br /><br /><br />
manner in which the Company proposes to finance the construction              <br /><br /><br />

not timely file.the maps required by Section 5.1(c) or does not timely file   <br /><br /><br />
the Feasibility Report and related materials as provided in this Section      <br /><br /><br />
5.2(a) and in Section 5.2(b).                                                 <br /><br /><br />
The Feasibility Report required by Section 5.2(a) shall be accompanied        <br /><br /><br />
by evidence of (he payment by the Company of the processing fee               <br /><br /><br />

If the Company proposes to produce Products from two or more separate         <br /><br /><br />
sites using similar extraction techniques and shared processing or            <br /><br /><br />
beneficiation facilities, a single Feasibility Report shall be required and a <br /><br /><br />
single Mining License shall be issued covering all such sites, subject to     <br /><br /><br />
the approval of the Minister of Finance for the treatment of such             <br /><br /><br />
operations and facilities as a single “mining project” under the Revenue      <br /><br /><br />
Code. If the Company proposes to use materially different extraction          <br /><br /><br />
techniques or substantially independent processing or beneficiation           <br /><br /><br />
facilities for separate mining sites, separate Mining Licenses and            <br /><br /><br />
Feasibility Reports shall be required for each site. Notwithstanding the      <br /><br /><br />
foregoing, nothing in this section 5.2 (c) shall require the approval of the  <br /><br /><br />
Minister of Finance for the treatment of any operations and facilities as a   <br /><br /><br />
single “mining project” where such operations and facilities are treated      <br /><br /><br />
as a single “mining project” pursuant to Section 5.2(d).                      <br /><br /><br />
Provided that the Company is using “shared infrastructure facilities” for     <br /><br /><br />
their operations, all operations covered and facilities shared by one or      <br /><br /><br />
more Mining Licenses granted in respect of the MDA shall be treated as        <br /><br /><br />
﻿ • ..ingle ‘ mining pi - >jcc: tor the purposes of the Revenue Code. As           <br /><br /><br />
 used herein, the Company shah be deemed to be using “shared                      <br /><br /><br />
 infrastructure facilities” for operations covered by more than one Mining        <br /><br /><br />
 License if such operations under the applicable Mining Licenses share            <br /><br /><br />
 the use of significant components of the Infrastructure, including shared        <br /><br /><br />
 use of rail, port, or processing plant Infrastructure.                           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 (e) If multiple Mining Licenses are required by Section 5.2(c), and the          <br /><br /><br />
 Company is not using shared infrastructure facilities for their operations,      <br /><br /><br />
 the Ministry will notify the Ministry of Finance of the applications of the      <br /><br /><br />
 Company, and the Minister of Finance is entitled to impose such                  <br /><br /><br />
 conditions upon such Mining Licenses as the Minister of Finance                  <br /><br /><br />
 reasonably deems necessary to comply with Revenue Code requirements              <br /><br /><br />
 of separating the costs and expenses of separate “mining projects”. The          <br /><br /><br />
 Minister of Finance reserves the right to require that a separate company        <br /><br /><br />
 be formed to hold each Mining License and related assets if it determines        <br /><br /><br />
 that to be the most appropriate means of separating the costs and                <br /><br /><br />
 expenses of separate “mining projects”.                                          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

Completion.                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
(a)    With respect to each proposed Mine, within 180 days of the scheduled      <br /><br /><br />
completion date thereof set forth in the Development Plan (subject to delay      <br /><br /><br />
on account of force majeurc), the Company shall demonstrate, through             <br /><br /><br />
performance of the proposed capacity demonstration testing program sol           <br /><br /><br />
forth in the Feasibility Study, that the Mine and all related Mining Plant,      <br /><br /><br />
Infrastructure and equipment have substantially the operating capacities set     <br /><br /><br />
forth in the Development Plan. As noted in Section 5.6(a), required              <br /><br /><br />
extended capacity demonstration covering major components of the Mine,           <br /><br /><br />
Mining Plant and Infrastructure may be conducted separately. Thus, if the        <br /><br /><br />
Feasibility Report and the Development Plan call for a two-stage                 <br /><br /><br />
development, with the initial stage being completion of a Mine, with the         <br /><br /><br />
initial Iron Ore processing facilities and railroad and port facilities tailored <br /><br /><br />
to the capacity of that Mine, followed by a second stage encompassing the        <br /><br /><br />
development of a second (or expanded) Mine and upgrade of the Iron Ore           <br /><br /><br />
processing facilities, railroad and port, each capacity demonstration test for   <br /><br /><br />
the first stage Mine, Mining Plant, Infrastructure and equipment shall be        <br /><br /><br />
completed within 180 days of the stage one scheduled completion date for         <br /><br /><br />
the components covered by that test, and each capacity demonstration test        <br /><br /><br />
for the second stage shall be completed within 180 days of the stage two         <br /><br /><br />
scheduled completion date for the components covered by that test.               <br /><br /><br />
(b)    The Company shall give the Ministry notice of, and the opportunity to     <br /><br /><br />
have representatives witness, ail testing required by the Development Plan       <br /><br /><br />
and shall evidence the satisfaction of each component of the required            <br /><br /><br />
capacity demonstrations by the timely delivery to the Minister of a              <br /><br /><br />
certificate of the Feasibility Consultant to the effect that the Company has     <br /><br /><br />
successfully completed such component of the capacity demonstration              <br /><br /><br />
program and has demonstrated the capacities required by such component           <br /><br /><br />
﻿(selling out the requirements and time period covered by the                    <br /><br /><br />
demonstrations and certifying specifically as to the actual results of the      <br /><br /><br />
demonstrations).                                                                <br /><br /><br />
(c) The Company shall pay minimum Royalties under this Agreement based          <br /><br /><br />
on the greater of actual Iron Ore shipments and assumed shipments equal         <br /><br /><br />
to 80% of design capacity as set forth in ihe approved Feasibility Report       <br /><br /><br />
from the outside day set forth in the first sentence of Section 6.2(a) for the  <br /><br /><br />
capacity demonstrations required by Section 5.6(a)(ix) until the date on        <br /><br /><br />
which such capacity demonstrations have been certified as required by this      <br /><br /><br />
Section 6.2. So long as the Company complies with the preceding                 <br /><br /><br />
sentence there are no other consequences for the failure of the Company to      <br /><br /><br />
satisfy the capacity demonstration requirements.                                <br /><br /><br />

(a) The Company will work towards and assist the Government in achieving            <br /><br /><br />
.the policy of the establishment or expansion of downstream metals                  <br /><br /><br />
processing facilities in Liberia in relation to pelletization or other further      <br /><br /><br />
beneficiation, refining and/or metals manufacturing and fabricating (to the         <br /><br /><br />
extent not already carried out by the Company pursuant to an approved               <br /><br /><br />
Feasibility Report) if, in light of recognized economic, technical and              <br /><br /><br />
scientific standards, the Iron Ore mined by the Company is amenable to              <br /><br /><br />
such additional activities and provided it is economically and practically          <br /><br /><br />
feasible to do so.                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
(k) At any time if the Company wishes to establish its own beneficiation,           <br /><br /><br />
pelletisation, refining or manufacturing facilities in Liberia, it may do so        <br /><br /><br />
pursuant to applicable Law, provided that any such facilities shall be              <br /><br /><br />
deemed additional Mining Plant to be incorporated in an amended                     <br /><br /><br />

feasibility study for the establishment in Liberia of a facility for the next       <br /><br /><br />
value added step in the transformation of Iron Ore into steel. “Value               <br /><br /><br />
added” means at a minimum both an increase in value ami an increase in              <br /><br /><br />
purity (grade) of the Product(s) of the Company’s Mine(s). If at the time           <br /><br /><br />
of the study the parties cannot agree on the appropriate next value                 <br /><br /><br />
addition step or steps, the parties will select an international expert in          <br /><br /><br />
iron and steel production to define the appropriate focus of the pre¬               <br /><br /><br />
feasibility study, with the costs of such expert to be shared equally by the        <br /><br /><br />
Government and the Company.                                                         <br /><br /><br />

entitled, working in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Works           <br /><br /><br />
(MOPW), to develop new roads and/or rehabilitate existing roads from its     <br /><br /><br />
mining sites to the Port, along the corridor designated in Exhibit 10B       <br /><br /><br />
hereto (which exhibit shall be prepared by the MOPW and attached to this     <br /><br /><br />
Agreement as an exhibit when it has been approved by the MOPW), as           <br /><br /><br />
may be reasonably required by the Company, subject to compliance with        <br /><br /><br />
applicable Laws, including the receipt of all necessary approvals and        <br /><br /><br />
permits, in connection with such development or rehabilitation. As a         <br /><br /><br />
condition to the use by the Company of new or existing roads to transport    <br /><br /><br />
Iron Ore to the Port, the Company shall conduct a short-form feasibility     <br /><br /><br />
study in accordance with terms of reference and other criteria specified by  <br /><br /><br />
the Government. Subject to approval by the Government of such                <br /><br /><br />
feasibility study, for a period of three (3) years following the approval of <br /><br /><br />
such feasibility study, the Company shall be allowed to transport Iron Ore   <br /><br /><br />
to the Port via such roads by trucks in the manner specified in and in       <br /><br /><br />
accordance with such feasibility study. As soon as the Railroad becomes      <br /><br /><br />
operational and can be used to transport the iron Ore to the Port, the       <br /><br /><br />
Company shall cease transporting the Iron Ore by trucks and shall only       <br /><br /><br />
transport it by the Railroad. The Company shall be responsible, at the       <br /><br /><br />
direction of the MOPW, for performing and paying for repair of any           <br /><br /><br />
damages and abnormal wear to roads and other infrastructure caused by its    <br /><br /><br />
use of public roads to transport Iron Ore. The Government shall retain title <br /><br /><br />
to any such roads constructed by the Company.                                <br /><br /><br />

Freeport of Monrovia cannot reasonably support the Iron Ore exporting        <br /><br /><br />
volume anticipated for the Company’s Operations throughout the term of       <br /><br /><br />
this Agreement after opportunities for expansion of the Freeport of          <br /><br /><br />
Monrovia have been exhausted, for the construction by the Company or         <br /><br /><br />
another entity that is mutually acceptable to the Company and the            <br /><br /><br />
Government of a new port or jetty (and related logistic areas) as required   <br /><br /><br />
to support its operations which shall be suitable and at a reasonable        <br /><br /><br />
distance from the Company’s mining sites. The Government shall provide       <br /><br /><br />
Marine Services and retain legal title to the leased areas of the Port and   <br /><br /><br />

while the Company shall have priority rights to possession and use of such   <br /><br /><br />
assets subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including      <br /><br /><br />
those with respect to the rights of third parties to utilize such assets     <br /><br /><br />
described in Section 6.7(d). Immediately upon the expiration of the Term     <br /><br /><br />
or any extensions thereof or earlier termination of this Agreement, all      <br /><br /><br />
rights of possession, control, and use shall revert to the Government. For   <br /><br /><br />
the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall at no time be exempt from          <br /><br /><br />
complying with all applicable Laws, including in particular all Laws with    <br /><br /><br />
respect to environmental contamination and remediation, in respect of its    <br /><br /><br />

﻿ror.idbL; rioiKc to the Company, authorize third    use of excess                   <br /><br /><br />
capacity of the Port, provided that the Company or the Government                   <br /><br /><br />
confirms that excess capacity exists and third party use of such excess             <br /><br /><br />
capacity does not unreasonably interfere with the efficient and economic            <br /><br /><br />
conduct of the Operations. The technical and commercial terms for such              <br /><br /><br />
third party use of the excess capacity shall be mutually agreed to in good          <br /><br /><br />
faith among the Government, the Company, and such third parties in                  <br /><br /><br />
accordance with acceptable international industrial standards. A formula            <br /><br /><br />
to share the revenue fees from such third-party use shall be agreed upon in         <br /><br /><br />
good faith between the Government and the Company. Such third party                 <br /><br /><br />
access and use shall be at no cost to the Company, and all related costs            <br /><br /><br />
shall be borne by the third party. The Company is not authorized to                 <br /><br /><br />

the LMC Pier during the “Construction Phase” (as such term is defined in            <br /><br /><br />
Section 1.01 and Appendix 4 of the Freeport Concession Agreement) as                <br /><br /><br />
set forth in Sections 4.04 and 7.06 of the Freeport Concession Agreement.           <br /><br /><br />
The Company shall use its best efforts to reach a separate written                  <br /><br /><br />
agreement with APMT as to mutual use of and access to the LMC Pier                  <br /><br /><br />
during the “Construction Phase” (as such term is defined in Section 1.01            <br /><br /><br />
and Appendix 4 of the Freeport Concession Agreement), or until such                 <br /><br /><br />
earlier time as APMT no longer has need to use the LMC Pier. Any such               <br /><br /><br />
agreement with APMT shall, to the extent possible, minimize any material            <br /><br /><br />
adverse effects on the ability of. APMT to perform its operations or                <br /><br /><br />
complete construction as contemplated by the Freeport Concession                    <br /><br /><br />

move bulk cargo, the Company shall permit such usage subject to the                 <br /><br /><br />
negotiation by the Company and the Government or such third party of                <br /><br /><br />
commercially reasonable rates for such usage. The costs of all required             <br /><br /><br />
additions to rolling stock and motive power to accommodate such usage               <br /><br /><br />
shall be borne by the Government or such third party', as applicable. If            <br /><br /><br />
accommodation of the requested additional usage would materially                    <br /><br /><br />
﻿adversely oifed the ability ol'lhe Company to move iron Ore to the Port or           <br /><br /><br />
handle Iron Ore trains at the Port, the Government or such third party shall         <br /><br /><br />
bear the cost of the additional investment needed to enhance the Railroad            <br /><br /><br />
to avoid such material adverse effect.                                               <br /><br /><br />
(g)    If the Government or one or more third parties wish to use the Railroad to    <br /><br /><br />
carry bulk cargo, the Company may continue to operate the Railroad itself            <br /><br /><br />
and carry out the operation of all trains on the Railroad, or the Company            <br /><br /><br />
may transfer operational responsibility for the Railroad to an operating             <br /><br /><br />
company owned by the Company and each other entity that has                          <br /><br /><br />
contributed to the capital investment (exclusive of motive power and                 <br /><br /><br />

      each Movable asset contained on such list. Movable assets identified in             <br /><br /><br />
      clause (i) of this Section 26.2(a) may be grouped for valuation purposes by         <br /><br /><br />
      generic type of asset and physical location, so that, for example, all              <br /><br /><br />
      Movable assets in a particular heavy equipment maintenance shop might               <br /><br /><br />

      “dragline and shovel parts and supplies” and “maintenance equipment”,               <br /><br /><br />
      but such grouping for valuation purposes docs not excuse the Company                <br /><br /><br />
﻿from the duty to describe such Movable assets in reasonable detail and the           <br /><br /><br />
Government may request that the price for specified items included on the            <br /><br /><br />
Property List be broken out from such aggregate valuation. The Property              <br /><br /><br />

located on Government Land), and any Movable assets which the                        <br /><br /><br />

This section comprises a summary of the exploration / PFS work programme envisaged by                 <br /><br /><br />
the Company. It is intended to illustrate works planned and should not be interpreted as              <br /><br /><br />
exhaustive or comprehensive.                                                                          <br /><br /><br />
1.1 Description of Exploration Activities Planned:                                                    <br /><br /><br />
The exploration work programme described in this section 1 comprises one key component                <br /><br /><br />
of a Pre-Feasibility Study on the Western Cluster iron ore project, leading to the generation         <br /><br /><br />
of a CRIRSCO-compliant Indicated Resource estimate.                                                   <br /><br /><br />
The PFS report for the Bomi and Mano River Deposits will be completed in the 1st phase and            <br /><br /><br />
a copy will be provided to the government no later than the second anniversary of the                 <br /><br /><br />
Effective Date, while the PFS for the Bea Mountain Deposits will be completed and a copy              <br /><br /><br />
provided to the Government no later than the third anniversary of the effective date. PFS             <br /><br /><br />
studies typically allow the project owner to evaluate and select the most economically and            <br /><br /><br />
technically viable option for project development, with 5-15% of engineering completed,               <br /><br /><br />
project specific cost estimates with an accuracy of ±20% and 15-20% Contingency. A                    <br /><br /><br />
detailed description of the scope of work for the generation of the resource estimate and for         <br /><br /><br />
the remainder of the PFS is presented at section 2.                                                   <br /><br /><br />

2. Scope of Work for PFS, Including Evaluation of processing, transportation and               <br /><br /><br />
export of iron ore from free port of Monrovia                                                  <br /><br /><br />
Company intends to evaluate the Western Cluster iron ore project in two stages:                <br /><br /><br />
i)    A Prefeasibility Study (PFS) which shall satisfy the requirements of this Agreement, and <br /><br /><br />
during which all alternative project concepts are assessed in sufficient thoroughness that     <br /><br /><br />
company can commit to a single project option that provides a viable, low risk business case,  <br /><br /><br />
for which further information would need to be gathered and assessed during a DFS.             <br /><br /><br />
ii)    A Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) which shall satisfy the requirements of this       <br /><br /><br />
Agreement, and during which the project is assessed in sufficient thoroughness that company    <br /><br /><br />
could subsequently commit to the project, subject to it meeting company’s investment and       <br /><br /><br />
other criteria. This DFS should be completed to the standard expected by international         <br /><br /><br />
financial institutions and their technical advisers.                                           <br /><br /><br />
In this section is described a typical PFS scope of work for an iron ore project in Liberia,   <br /><br /><br />
which is likely to be applied to the Western Cluster iron ore project. This description is not <br /><br /><br />
﻿presented as being cither exhaustive in scope or complete in its detail. It should also be read      <br /><br /><br />
in conjunction with section 1 above, which outlines the exploration works planned by                 <br /><br /><br />
company to generate data for a CRIRSCO-compliant indicated mineral resource estimate,                <br /><br /><br />
which is a key component of the PFS.                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
2.1    Scope of Pre Feasibility Study                                                                <br /><br /><br />
The manner of execution of the pre feasibility and feasibility stages of a project and their         <br /><br /><br />
scope extent can have a profound impact on the successful outcome of the project,                    <br /><br /><br />
Adequate investment in these phases is necessary to ensure success. A PFS typically                  <br /><br /><br />
addresses the following factors relating to the development of a mining Project i.e. i) strategy     <br /><br /><br />
and market analysis, ii) assessment of the likely technical and Economic viability of a set of       <br /><br /><br />
alternative mining, process, location, capacity and project configuration alternatives to            <br /><br /><br />
determine the preferred alternative for a DFS, iii) determination of the material risks, key         <br /><br /><br />
value drivers and risk/reward profile, iv) a description of the alternatives and final               <br /><br /><br />
recommendation, and v) development of a work plan, schedule, cost, resources and services            <br /><br /><br />
requirements necessary to undertake project development through the feasibility study to             <br /><br /><br />
implementation. The PFS report will typically contain the chapters described in the following        <br /><br /><br />
sections plus an executive summary that clearly summarises the content of the study report in        <br /><br /><br />
a concise manner and presents the project strategy and recommended project configuration to          <br /><br /><br />
be studied further in the DFS stage.                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
2.2    Market Analysis                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
The objective of this work is to support Company’s PFS with an overview of the current and           <br /><br /><br />
projected global iron ore industry - its products, suppliers, customers and cost drivers and         <br /><br /><br />
the positioning of Western Cluster iron ore products in that competitive .environment. This          <br /><br /><br />
overview will include i) industry competitors, ii) market overview and iii) industry cost            <br /><br /><br />
drivers. The data presented will be drawn together and some concluding remarks offered               <br /><br /><br />
which detail both the historical and future attractiveness of the iron ore industry with             <br /><br /><br />
particular focus on the dynamics of the Atlantic Basin. A marketing and pricing strategy for         <br /><br /><br />
the Western Cluster iron ore products will be presented.                                             <br /><br /><br />
2.3    Geology and Mineral Resources                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
Company will continue to load and maintain a comprehensive electronic database that                  <br /><br /><br />
contains records of numerous attributes of geological samples, as well as results of tests to        <br /><br /><br />
establish the quality (accuracy and precision) of the geological data, and metadata recording        <br /><br /><br />
test methods, batch numbers, limits of detection, etc. The contents of the geological database       <br /><br /><br />
will be reviewed against original survey records, geological logs, and laboratory reports to         <br /><br /><br />
establish the reliability of the information within the database. The geological data will then      <br /><br /><br />
be interpreted and the sequence subdivided into rock units that are meaningful to mining and/        <br /><br /><br />
or mineral processing, and are as mineralogically and grade homogenous as possible. The              <br /><br /><br />
spatial distribution of these rock units will be interpreted, and samples assigned to these units.   <br /><br /><br />
The data from samples within each unit would then be assessed to establish the characteristics       <br /><br /><br />
of the unit, and the distance over which grades are statistically related within each unit (i.e.     <br /><br /><br />
geostatistics).                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
A digital cellular resource model will be created that contains estimates of rock type, grades       <br /><br /><br />
of mineralisation, and density of all rocks, for all rock units in the proposed volume to be         <br /><br /><br />
mined. This resource model will be the basis for estimates of Mineral Resources, and mine            <br /><br /><br />
design leading to estimates of Mineral Reserves. The estimates of Mineral Resources will be          <br /><br /><br />
classified according to definitions in the CRIRSCO reporting template.                               <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
 ''N                                                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
﻿ 2.4 Mining                                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 The PFS will investigate and report on a number of alternative scenarios to generate               <br /><br /><br />
 preliminary mine development plans to exploit the Western Cluster iron ore resource. The           <br /><br /><br />
 aim is to narrow down the process and productivity alternatives into a single business case.       <br /><br /><br />
 The level of detail required in the study must be sufficient to ensure the alternatives are        <br /><br /><br />
 correctly ranked and the one selected scenario will deliver the best possible outcome.             <br /><br /><br />
 The mine planning activities undertaken as part of the PFS will include provision of i) an         <br /><br /><br />
 overall description of the site layout, ii) a summary description of the key issues in describing  <br /><br /><br />
 the geological resource, including a description of tire geological block model, material          <br /><br /><br />
 characteristics and resource estimate, iii) the key geotechnical parameters and hydro              <br /><br /><br />
 geological considerations including wall stability, surface and groundwater conditions etc. iv)    <br /><br /><br />
 an understanding of the main environmental and cultural considerations, and v) a summary           <br /><br /><br />
 description of the assumptions used to generate a mine design to a high level of confidence        <br /><br /><br />
 (basis of design document), including the main economic criteria to be applied to the project,     <br /><br /><br />
 process recovery and marketing. The mining methods being considered will be then be                <br /><br /><br />
 discussed and defined, The first task in the execution stage of the PFS will be to generate a      <br /><br /><br />
 mineable resource model, taking into account such factors as cut-off grade, ore dilution and       <br /><br /><br />
 ore recovery. This model will be used as the basis for the pit optimisation strategic study. The   <br /><br /><br />
 assessment of the model and project requirements will assist in the definition of the mine         <br /><br /><br />
 production rate for each of the alternative options. The preliminary definition of ore and         <br /><br /><br />
 waste will follow. Based on reference to physical and economic parameters, a high level pit        <br /><br /><br />
 optimisation assessment will be undertaken. Once the optimum pit shells (including cut-back        <br /><br /><br />
 sequence) have been selected, a strategic approach to pit development will follow. An              <br /><br /><br />
 indicative pit design with mineral inventory statement will be created, Scheduling of the mine     <br /><br /><br />
 will provide a practical mine production sequence for the development of the deposit. The          <br /><br /><br />
 PFS will also investigate the waste and overburden removal strategy and stockpile and dump         <br /><br /><br />
 designs. The task then is to investigate the material handling alternatives to establish truck     <br /><br /><br />
 fleet or other material handling configurations. The operating and capital costs will then be      <br /><br /><br />
 estimated and will include high level manning and infrastructure requirements. A summary           <br /><br /><br />
 list of the mine equipment requirements will be made for each alternative, to suit the             <br /><br /><br />
 production constraints and mining method.                                                          <br /><br /><br />
 The alternative scenarios will then be tabulated and assessed with trade-off studies to arrive at  <br /><br /><br />
 a single “go forward” recommendation from the study. Technical risks associated with the           <br /><br /><br />
 mining aspects of the operation will then be discussed, A future work Program will then be         <br /><br /><br />
 defined to further evaluate the recommended alternative.                                           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
2.5 Mineral Processing                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
The PFS will investigate and report on the various alternatives considered and the decision         <br /><br /><br />
making process applied to determine the single, “go forward”, DFS case. The level of detail         <br /><br /><br />
and depth of study required must be sufficient to ensure that the selected DFS case will lead       <br /><br /><br />
to the most valuable outcome for Company giving full consideration of the risk vs. reward           <br /><br /><br />
context.                                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
A number of flow sheet options will be developed for the PFS. The study will examine all of         <br /><br /><br />
these options and any others that might arise in sufficient detail to enable a decision to be       <br /><br /><br />
made as to which should become the base case for the DFS. In doing so the following factors,        <br /><br /><br />
amongst others, will be considered; ore characteristics, test work results, environmental           <br /><br /><br />
impacts, capital and operating costs.                                                               <br /><br /><br />
 In the initial stage of the PFS the process design team will liaise with geologists and mining     <br /><br /><br />
 engineers to develop a preliminary product grade model to be used in pit optimisation              <br /><br /><br />
 exercises. Using the preliminary basis for design document prepared from the metallurgical         <br /><br /><br />
﻿test work programme as a starling point, the process design will be developed to provide for      <br /><br /><br />
each option, preliminary; design criteria, flow diagrams, mass balance, equipment sc! ns,         <br /><br /><br />
description and costs. The prediction and control of final product quality is a key element of    <br /><br /><br />
the design which involves close cooperation between mining and process engine'; -. The            <br /><br /><br />
planning of mine schedules, crushing campaigns, mine stockpiles and port stockpiles will be       <br /><br /><br />
conducted as an iterative exercise. The PFS report will contain a description of the              <br /><br /><br />
development of the final recommended flow sheet clearly demonstrating how the flo\. sheet         <br /><br /><br />
was derived from metallurgical test work data, experience at other mines and financial            <br /><br /><br />
evaluation.                                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
A review of available information will be undertaken by the PFS engineering conlnctor to          <br /><br /><br />
identify key site information including i) geological setting, ii) climatic setting, iii)         <br /><br /><br />
Hydrological setting, iv) topographic data, and v) local and regional infrastructure. The         <br /><br /><br />
results of the review will be referenced in conjunction with project requiremt. as ,md            <br /><br /><br />
constraints identified by company and the PFS engineering contractor to identify a preferred      <br /><br /><br />
Plant location and site layout.                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
A preliminary geotechnical investigation will be carried out to assist in the selec ion of        <br /><br /><br />
suitable locations for plant and infrastructure facilities and to provide preliminary data for    <br /><br /><br />
foundation and structural design,                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
Based on the process mass balances equipment selections and sizing will be determined for         <br /><br /><br />
each option and a mechanical layout prepared. Preliminary 3D models will be dev-.; -ped           <br /><br /><br />
including mechanical equipment layout and arrangement, structural elements and piping.            <br /><br /><br />
Material quantities derived from these models and from preliminary engineering designs will       <br /><br /><br />
be used in capital cost estimating. Preliminary power generation, distribution and control        <br /><br /><br />
designs will be prepared. The plant operating, manning and control philosophies will be           <br /><br /><br />
agreed which provide input to the capital and operating cost estimates.                           <br /><br /><br />
2.6 Railroad Infrastructure:                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
Rail road infrastructure, specifically road and rail access to the project site is a key          <br /><br /><br />
component of the project and will require assessment during the PFS. Work will include            <br /><br /><br />
surveying and mapping, geological and geotechnical, and bathymetry and coastal engineering.       <br /><br /><br />
Preliminary environmental and social impact statements.                                           <br /><br /><br />
All options for the ore transport from plant to port will be explored. The PFS engineering and    <br /><br /><br />
cost estimates will be developed to the extent that a single preferred option can be identified.  <br /><br /><br />
The PFS scope of work for the railway will include i) a desktop review of existing                <br /><br /><br />
documentation and identification of route selection constraints including any cadastral,          <br /><br /><br />
geotechnical, hydrological, community and environmental issues, ii) the assessment and            <br /><br /><br />
selection of preferred routes, including survey and measurement where necessary, iii)             <br /><br /><br />
conceptual civil design for the preferred routes, typical formation designs, hydrological         <br /><br /><br />

yards and loading/unloading facilities and signalling, communications and control systems,        <br /><br /><br />
and vii) preliminary assessment of operations and maintenance requirements.                       <br /><br /><br />
The PFS scope of work for the port facility will include i) a review' of existing hydrological,   <br /><br /><br />
geological data and facilities available at the Monrovia Port iii) a review of the inlet channel  <br /><br /><br />
and a preliminary estimate of dredging requirements, iv) an optimised vessel size using the       <br /><br /><br />
port, and v) a preliminary design of the quays and jetty. Also the land area required for         <br /><br /><br />
handling, storage and ship loading facilities as required to support planned volumes of export.   <br /><br /><br />
﻿The PFS scope of work for site infrastructure engineering will include evaluation of i)water        <br /><br /><br />
supply, storage and reticulation, ii) sewage collection and treatment, iii) a site layout plan, iv) <br /><br /><br />
site earthworks and drainage, vi) tailings storage facility, vii) accommodation, viii)              <br /><br /><br />
industrial buildings, ix) power supply.                                                             <br /><br /><br />
2.7    Human Resources                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
The PFS will include an examination, at a high level, of the Human Resources (HR) issues            <br /><br /><br />
associated with the operational philosophy and management strategies identified for the             <br /><br /><br />
project. Issues to be addressed include organisational philosophy and model, cultural fit,          <br /><br /><br />
skills requirements, employee relations, recruitment and training and the statutory                 <br /><br /><br />
environment. Cost estimates for initial recruitment and training and ongoing HR related             <br /><br /><br />
activities will be prepared and included in the financial evaluations.                              <br /><br /><br />
2.8    Project Execution                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
The PFS will develop and describe a recommended project execution approach; it should               <br /><br /><br />
describe the alternatives considered and clearly explain why the recommended approach has           <br /><br /><br />
been selected. The preliminary project execution plan will address project scope, design            <br /><br /><br />
criteria, product specifications, quality controls and key safety, health, environmental and        <br /><br /><br />
security issues. A facility and package work breakdown structure will be developed as a basis       <br /><br /><br />
for engineering, estimating and cost control. A recommendation will be made on the                  <br /><br /><br />
approach to engineering and the standards to be applied. Execution methodologies and                <br /><br /><br />
contracting strategies will be examined and a preferred selection made which will form the          <br /><br /><br />
basis of the PFS and subsequent DFS. This will include procurement and contracting                  <br /><br /><br />
strategies for execution, equipment and consumables. A high level project development               <br /><br /><br />
schedule showing major DFS, engineering, construction, commissioning, start-up and ramp             <br /><br /><br />
up activities will be developed.                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
2.9    Operations Management                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
The PFS will address the establishment, commissioning, start up and operating needs of the          <br /><br /><br />
project in terms of the operating philosophy, owner or contractor, organisation and                 <br /><br /><br />
consequent labour, industrial relations and logistical requirements. Specific issues to be          <br /><br /><br />
addressed include organisational structure, resources required and source/conditions of             <br /><br /><br />
employment, accommodation, transport logistics and administration.                                  <br /><br /><br />
2.10    Information Management                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
During the PFS stage the information management and technology requirements of the                  <br /><br /><br />
project during both the execution and operating phases will need to be addressed.                   <br /><br /><br />
Preliminary plans and systems will be developed for the capture, sharing and transfer, back¬        <br /><br /><br />
up and security of data, information and knowledge.                                                 <br /><br /><br />
2.11    Health, Safety', Environment and Community                                                  <br /><br /><br />
For a PFS the role of the environmental and social impact team members is to better define i)       <br /><br /><br />
the environmental legislation and international guidelines the project will need to comply          <br /><br /><br />
with, ii) the environmental and social footprint for the project, iii) the key environmental and    <br /><br /><br />
social risks, and iv) finally to communicate the findings and recommendations for                   <br /><br /><br />
management measures to the project engineering design team. This will allow environmental           <br /><br /><br />
and social issues to be identified early and incorporated into environmental and social design      <br /><br /><br />
criteria and environmental and social management plans for the project.                             <br /><br /><br />
At the PFS stage it will be important to gain a thorough understanding of the legislative           <br /><br /><br />
framework as it applies to environmental and social aspects of major projects such as this.         <br /><br /><br />
﻿This will enable .‘itraiegies'plans lo be developed and implemented with respect to gaining        <br /><br /><br />
access and tenure to the required deposits and land and achieving government approval for          <br /><br /><br />
the project. In addition to meeting the environmental legislation requirements of the              <br /><br /><br />
Government of Liberia, it is considered best practice to also match the guidelines issued by       <br /><br /><br />
international agencies, in particular the World Bank’s (WB) Equator Principles and the             <br /><br /><br />
International Finance Corporation’s (1FC) Performance Standards, The 1FC requirements              <br /><br /><br />
must be complied with if finance is sought from an Equator Principles financial institution.       <br /><br /><br />
The PFS stage of a project is when information and data relating to the environmental              <br /><br /><br />
and social footprint of the project is collected. This information will be collected through       <br /><br /><br />
initial baseline studies, as well as through ongoing environmental monitoring of the project       <br /><br /><br />
activities, over the duration of the exploration phase of works. In order to fully assess the      <br /><br /><br />
environmental impacts of the project will be necessary to have data available that represents      <br /><br /><br />
the environmental baseline prior to commencement of development activities associated with         <br /><br /><br />
the project. It is anticipated that there is minimal environmental or biodiversity information     <br /><br /><br />
currently available at the required level of detail for the areas that fall within the project     <br /><br /><br />
footprint. will therefore be necessary to engage suitably qualified professionals to               <br /><br /><br />
undertake baseline studies. It will be important to commence these studies at an early stage in    <br /><br /><br />
the project lifecycle to allow sufficient time to collect data in both wet and dry seasons where   <br /><br /><br />
relevant. It will also be important to have the information available prior to the project design  <br /><br /><br />
being fixed because late design changes to mitigate environmental or social impacts can add        <br /><br /><br />
unnecessary cost and result in delays.                                                             <br /><br /><br />
The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Scoping Study will define the                <br /><br /><br />
baseline data required but it is envisaged that the following surveys/studies will be required     <br /><br /><br />
i) a review of the project areas with respect to protected areas, ii) vegetation and fauna         <br /><br /><br />
surveys, of the areas impacted by the project, iii)’background air quality survey, iv) surface     <br /><br /><br />
and groundwater studies, v) climate and noise surveys and vi) a marine survey at for the port.     <br /><br /><br />
In order to fully assess the social impact of the project on human communities likely to be        <br /><br /><br />
affected by the project, it will be necessary to collect baseline data in the following areas i)   <br /><br /><br />
social footprint of the project, ii) social and administrative structures within the region, iii)  <br /><br /><br />
demographic study, iv) education and health statistics, v) land use and tenure, vi) livelihood     <br /><br /><br />
activities & employment opportunities, vii) cultural heritage, public attitudes and perceptions    <br /><br /><br />
and infrastructure and public services. At the PFS stage the social professionals on the project   <br /><br /><br />
team will also commence the compilation of a stakeholder register. The stakeholders will           <br /><br /><br />
include government agencies, non-government organisations (NGO's) and key members of               <br /><br /><br />
the local communities. In addition a consultation strategy and a stakeholder engagement plan       <br /><br /><br />
will be developed and implementation of the consultation plan will also commence at this           <br /><br /><br />
stage. The information collected as a result of the studies outlined above will be collated,       <br /><br /><br />
summarised and presented as a report, or Project Brief, prepared pursuant to section 8 of the      <br /><br /><br />
Environment Protection Law. The Project Brief will enable a preliminary assessment of              <br /><br /><br />
potential environmental and social impacts to be conducted. The project Brief will also be         <br /><br /><br />
used in later stages of the project such as the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment         <br /><br /><br />
process and in the preparation of environmental and social management plans. Preliminary           <br /><br /><br />
Environmental and Social Design Criteria (ESDC) will be prepared for the project. The              <br /><br /><br />
ESDC will be based on Liberian legislative requirements. World Bank guidelines, World              <br /><br /><br />
Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, best practice guidelines and other appropriate               <br /><br /><br />
standards and limits together with company’s environmental and social objectives. Social           <br /><br /><br />
criteria will include the findings of the study of people’s perceptions and values. The criteria   <br /><br /><br />
will cover all aspects of the project. The ESDC is a document that will be used by the design      <br /><br /><br />
team lo ensure the project achieves the required level of performance with respect to              <br /><br /><br />
environmental and social impacts. In order to achieve development approval from the                <br /><br /><br />

2.13    Operating C#st Estimates                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
The operating cost estimates prepared for each project alternative at the PFS level will             <br /><br /><br />
typically have an accuracy range of ±25%, sufficient for ranking, rejection and selection of         <br /><br /><br />
alternatives. The estimates for consumables, labour, spares, administration, etc. will be            <br /><br /><br />

2.14    Ownership, Legal and Contractual                                                             <br /><br /><br />
This chapter of the PFS will address issues relating to ownership of the resource, royalties,        <br /><br /><br />
ownership of land and surface rights and the status of any negotiations pertaining thereto. It       <br /><br /><br />
will also address sovereign risk, the legal a^d regulatory systems applicable and taxation. At       <br /><br /><br />
the PFS stage the intended contractual strategies for sales and marketing, labour, major inputs      <br /><br /><br />
(electricity, water, etc.) and intellectual properly will be developed.                              <br /><br /><br />
2.15 Financial Evaluations                                                                           <br /><br /><br />
A complete financial evaluation of the selected alternative only will be presented in the PFS        <br /><br /><br />
report. It will be structured so as to address company's investment criteria and hurdles and         <br /><br /><br />
may be carried out by company or by the PFS contractor. The economic analysis for a major            <br /><br /><br />
project such as Western Cluster is intended to capture all of the key aspects of the preliminary     <br /><br /><br />
work that has been completed (engineering, market study, etc.) to develop potential outcomes         <br /><br /><br />
that can be used to evaluate potential opportunities and risks. During the PFS, a number of          <br /><br /><br />
options will be evaluated at a sufficient level of detail to select a preferred alternative for the  <br /><br /><br />
subsequent DFS. The economic analysis at this stage of development will be budgetary, to             <br /><br /><br />
help i) determine the validity of the business case, ii) select the best project option, iii) set    <br /><br /><br />
project objectives, including target cost and schedule, iv) decide on whether to proceed to a        <br /><br /><br />
DFS (“go or no-go decision point”), and v) define the scope and work plan for a DFS.                 <br /><br /><br />
Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a valuation method used to estimate the                       <br /><br /><br />
attractiveness of an investment opportunity using future free cash flow projections and              <br /><br /><br />
discounting them (using the weighted average cost of capital) to arrive at a present value,          <br /><br /><br />
﻿which is used to evaluate the potential for investment. If the value arrived at through DCF          <br /><br /><br />
analysis is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity may be a good one.       <br /><br /><br />
A DCF model will be developed for Western Cluster, including the following key inputs i)             <br /><br /><br />
revenues and production rate will be based on projected throughput and iron ore prices taken         <br /><br /><br />
from the preliminary market study, ii) capital and operating cost estimates, iii) a preliminary      <br /><br /><br />
estimate of working capital requirements, iv) a proposed capital structure and proposed              <br /><br /><br />
financing, discussed and agreed with Company’s shareholders to determine the appropriate             <br /><br /><br />
cost of capital (preliminary at this stage), v) an allowance for taxes based on local regulations,   <br /><br /><br />
vi) foreign exchange rate assumptions taken from consensus forecasts, and vii) a list of risk        <br /><br /><br />
items not included in the capital cost estimate will be prepared, and an allowance made for          <br /><br /><br />
risk management and mitigation (based on experience and benchmarking).                               <br /><br /><br />
The financial model wiil be used to evaluate, for each option being considered, i) project           <br /><br /><br />
internal rate of return (IRR), ii) net present value (NPV), iii) payback period, and iv)             <br /><br /><br />
sensitivity of NPV to variations to major input parameters, including product price, capital         <br /><br /><br />
cost, major operating cost inputs (diesel, labour, etc.), foreign exchange rate, and other           <br /><br /><br />
relevant variables. The results wiil be used to help determine the viability of the project, areas   <br /><br /><br />
of potential risk and opportunity and the best project option for the subsequent DFS.                <br /><br /><br />
2.16 Work Plan                                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
As part of the PFS a work plan for the further development of the project will be prepared           <br /><br /><br />
which will include i) activities for commencing the DFS, ii) DFS activities, iii) pre-project        <br /><br /><br />
commitments required, iv) a detailed DFS schedule, v) a preliminary project schedule, and vi)        <br /><br /><br />
a DFS cost estimate and implementation plan etc.                                                     <br /><br /><br />

entered into an APA complies hilly with its terms and conditions, the Ministry of Finance will not contest the               <br /><br /><br />
application of the TPM to the .subject matter of the APA.                                                                    <br /><br /><br />

the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the               <br /><br /><br />
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest          <br /><br /><br />

each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of             <br /><br /><br />
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.                                  <br /><br /><br />

SECTION 730. SURTAX ON INCOME FROM HIGH-YIELD PROJECTS                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
(a)    Purpose. This section applies to determine whether a mining project is sufficiently high-yield to be subject to   <br /><br /><br />
surtax and, i F so, the amount of tax.                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
(b)    Definition of High-Yield. A mining project is considered high-yield and thus subject to surtax when the           <br /><br /><br />
project’s pre-tax rale of return on total investment is greater than 22.5 percent, the threshold rate of return for      <br /><br /><br />
application of this Section.                                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
(c)    Method to Calculate Yield. A mining project's accumulated negative net cash flow shall be determined by           <br /><br /><br />
applying an annual accumulation factor of 1.225 to negative net cash Row carried forward from a prior tax                <br /><br /><br />
period. At the close of each tax period, accumulated negative net cash flow earned forward from the prior                <br /><br /><br />
period shall be increased by current negative net cash flow or offset by current positive net cash flow. A project       <br /><br /><br />
is not high-yield and subject to surtax unless its accumulated net cash flow at the close of a period is positive.       <br /><br /><br />
(d)    Surtax Rate. Positive net accumulated cash flow at the close of a tax period is taxable at a rate of 20 percent,  <br /><br /><br />
and the amount of this liability is deductible from gross income for the tax period in accordance with Section           <br /><br /><br />
705(b).                                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
(e)    Re-Set Accumulation to Zero. Following a tax period for which tax is due under tiiis section, a mining project's  <br /><br /><br />
accumulated negative cash flow is re-set to zero and (he method of subsection (d) is re-applied using zero as the        <br /><br /><br />
starting point for the succeeding lax period.                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
(I) Steps to Calculate Yield. Beginning with the first tax period in which a mining project has a Class A mining         <br /><br /><br />
license and has begun construction, the following steps are used to calculate yield in accordance with subsection        <br /><br /><br />
(c).                                                                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
(1)    Cost. State the expenditures, as specified in Section 731, for the tax period. This is the project's cost         <br /><br /><br />
through the dose of the period. Go to Step 2.                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
(2)    Revenues. State the project's revenues, as specified in Section 732, for the tax period, including revenues,      <br /><br /><br />
if any, from the exploration period as defined in Section 700. This amount is the project's revenues                     <br /><br /><br />
through the close of the period. Go to Step 3.                                                                           <br /><br /><br />
(3)    Test Net Cash Flow.                                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
(A)    Determine net cash flow. Subtract from revenues the amount of cost to arrive at net cash flow (R • C =            <br /><br /><br />
NCF).                                                                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
(B)    Net cash flow zero or negative. If net cash flow is zero or negative, the project is not yet a high-yield         <br /><br /><br />
project and the surtax does not apply. Multiply the negative net cash flow by 1.225 to arrive at the                     <br /><br /><br />
project's accumulated negative net cash flow to be carried to the next lax period. Go to Step 4.                         <br /><br /><br />
﻿(C) Net is positive. If riet cash flow is positive, tax is determined under subsection (d), and this amount is        <br /><br /><br />
deductible in determining taxable income under Section 703. Accumulated negative net cash flow is                     <br /><br /><br />
te-set to zero in accordance with subsection (e), Go to Step 4.                                                       <br /><br /><br />
