understood that as regards to the Existing Infrastructures and the Additional Infrastructures and<br /><br />
Installations used in common, the following priority will apply:<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
first, to CBG in accordance with article 8 of the Concession Agreement, and also to its<br /><br />
bauxite activities in relation to a CBG Refinery (as defined hereunder);<br /><br />
10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
second, to GAC SA within the scope of the transportation of its intrants and of the export<br /><br />
of its alumina production for the entire duration of the Project.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of the rules above, “CBG Refinery” means any alumina refinery owned by, and under<br /><br />
complete control of, CBG.<br /><br />
Moreover:<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If, as a result of the extensions of CBG’s activities, including without limitation the<br /><br />
construction of a CBG Refinery, CBG’s capacity needs would increase beyond (i) the<br /><br />
Attributed Capacity as of the Effective Date, which is, for the purpose of this Infrastructure<br /><br />
Agreement, as set forth in section 2 of Annex 3 I and (ii) after the investment of GAC SA<br /><br />
as contemplated in section 3 of Annex 3 I, the capacity allocated to it pursuant to such<br /><br />
section 3, CBG shall have the obligation to create the additional capacity required by such<br /><br />
extensions and to bear the costs of the infrastructure built to that effect.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
GAC SA shall have the obligation to create any additional capacity above the Attributed<br /><br />
Capacity as of the Effective Date required as a result of GAC SA’s activities’, including<br /><br />
without limitation the Project and any extensions thereof, and to bear the costs of the<br /><br />
infrastructure built to that effect. In this respect, after the investment of GAC SA as<br /><br />
contemplated in section 3 of Annex 3 I, GAC SA’s allocated capacity is as set forth in such<br /><br />
section 3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the above, if, as a result of CBG’s activities, CBG’s capacity needs would<br /><br />
decrease below the Attributed Capacity as of the Effective Date as set out above, CBG<br /><br />
shall have the right to make available its remaining capacity to a third party User, in<br /><br />
agreement with ANAIM, in which case, such third party User shall not benefit from CBG’s<br /><br />
first priority.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
These provisions do not affect those specifically provided for the New Commercial Dock.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The rules regarding day-to-day use of the Existing Infrastructure and Additional<br /><br />
Infrastructures and Installations are defined in Articles 8 and 10 of this Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that capacity on the Existing Infrastructure and Additional Infrastructures and<br /><br />
Installations used in common has to be rationed due to the necessity to undertake<br /><br />
maintenance, effect repairs, or respond to some other system constraint that may occur<br /><br />
from time to time, such rationing for each User shall be made pro-rata based upon the<br /><br />
programme agreed upon pursuant to the provisions of Articles 8.3 and 10.2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.3 It is agreed that the capacity that may be made available to third parties contemplated in<br /><br />
paragraph 4.2 above shall not limit the capacity already made available to GAC SA or to CBG or to<br /><br />
another user. It is agreed that all costs generated by the work for the creation of additional capacity to<br /><br />
accommodate the needs of such third parties and by the use by these third parties shall be paid by<br /><br />
such third parties or by the State.<br /><br />
4.4 Taking into account the demographic pressure in the industrial zone of Kamsar, any connection<br /><br />
to the Main Railway Line which would cause the railway line to be doubled in the town zones must be<br /><br />
protected by any appropriate means for the safety of the population.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All stations and crossing points shall also be protected by enclosures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6 GAC SA's rolling stock that will be used on the Main Railway Line shall have technical<br /><br />
characteristics that are compatible with those of the rolling stock currently used by CBG and shall be<br /><br />
compliant with technical specifications of the Main Railway Line.<br /><br />
4.7 In addition, if GAC SA desires to operate its rolling stock or entrust the operation of its rolling<br /><br />
stock to a Direct Sub-Contractor other than CBG, a special agreement shall be established between the<br /><br />
Concessionaire, GAC SA and/or such Direct Sub-Contractor, as the case may be, which the State<br /><br />
guarantees.<br /><br />
In such event, GAC SA or its Direct Sub-Contractor’s train drivers shall be trained and certified by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire in accordance with the standards developed by the Concessionaire in compliance with<br /><br />
the railway operating rules and shall comply with the operating instructions provided by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire.<br /><br />
The Concessionaire may, in conjunction with GAC SA, inspect the rolling stock and/or audit its<br /><br />
maintenance to determine compliance with the Rules of the Art and to attempt to prevent damage to the<br /><br />
Main Railway Line. Such inspection/audits will not unreasonably disrupt the operations of GAC SA,<br /><br />
which ANAIM guarantees. All inspection and audit reports will be shared between the Parties.<br /><br />

SA as reflected in the programme adopted by the Technical Committee, will update and republish the<br /><br />
weekly and daily shipping programmes.<br /><br />
Any modification to the republished programme shall be made by consensus with the relevant User, it<br /><br />
being specified that this consensus rule does not apply to emergency situations and out-of-course<br /><br />
events. For the purposes of this Article, “out-of-course events” shall mean any event happening on the<br /><br />
Channel and Additional Infrastructures and Installations related to it, which is unforeseen and beyond<br /><br />
the reasonable control of the Concessionaire. In such instance, ANAIM and the State shall ensure that<br /><br />
the Concessionaire makes then its commercially reasonable efforts to inform and consult with the<br /><br />
affected User(s). ANAIM and the State shall ensure that the Concessionaire uses its commercially<br /><br />
reasonable efforts to minimize the disruption suffered with respect to each such event and restore the<br /><br />
normal service pattern as quickly as possible.<br /><br />
In addition, for the purposes of monitoring and daily management, in line with the best interests of GAC<br /><br />
SA, the State and ANAIM shall ensure that the Concessionaire:<br /><br />
19<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
maintains a permanent communication between the Concessionaire’s control facility and<br /><br />
GAC SA’s control facility. The mode of such communication shall be agreed by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire and GAC SA in accordance with the Rules of the Art; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
uses reasonable efforts to put into place for GAC SA a right of access to visit the<br /><br />
Concessionaire’s control facilities at any time.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 11: IMPROVEMENT OF MARITIME SIGNALING<br /><br />
GAC SA will transmit to ANAIM, which transmit to the Concessionaire, a draft programme for the<br /><br />
improvement of the maritime signaling system describing GAC SA’s needs regarding the movements of<br /><br />
ships of GAC SA in the port of Kamsar.<br /><br />
ANAIM will ensure that the Concessionaire submits its technical report to the Technical Committee for<br /><br />
adoption within three (3) months of its communication. In this respect, ANAIM undertake not to withhold<br /><br />
their consent to GAC SA’s program without a legitimate motivation, duly justified from a technical and/or<br /><br />
financial point of view, nor to subject their consent to conditions which are not duly justified from a<br /><br />
technical and/or financial point of view.<br /><br />
After adoption, these construction plans shall constitute Annex 3 C, which shall be an integral part of<br /><br />
this Agreement.<br /><br />
The new equipments must be compatible with those of the existing system.<br /><br />
This improvement plan and its implementation shall be financed by the escrow account in place for the<br /><br />
maintenance of the Existing Infrastructures of the Kamsar Port (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is<br /><br />
different from the Escrow Account contemplated herein).<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 21 and 25, ANAIM and the State shall ensure that these<br /><br />
improvement and completion plans shall be correctly implemented by the Concessionaire.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 12: FRENCH DOCK<br /><br />
The State grants to GAC SA the right to use the French Dock provided that such use will respect the<br /><br />

PRICING AND ROYALTIES - RIGHTS OF USE<br /><br />
ARTICLE 18: TARIFF<br /><br />
18.1 Rights of Use:<br /><br />
The tariff to be paid by GAC SA for the access to and the use of the Main Railway Line and the<br /><br />
Additional Infrastructures and Installations related to it (including the Rail Signaling and<br /><br />
Communications) to be applied to GAC SA by the State shall be calculated on the basis of the principle<br /><br />
of proportion of the quantities transported as well as the length of the section of the Main Railway Line<br /><br />
effectively used by GAC SA, in relation to the royalty effectively paid by CBG under the Concession<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Agreement (such royalty may potentially be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of such<br /><br />
Concession Agreement).<br /><br />
18.2 Track Service Charge:<br /><br />
GAC SA shall pay a pro rata allocation of the Track Service Charge (as defined below), which pro rata<br /><br />
allocation shall be calculated on the basis of the principle of proportion of the quantities transported as<br /><br />
well as the length of the section of the Main Railway Line and the Additional Infrastructures and<br /><br />
Installations related to it effectively used by GAC SA.<br /><br />
The quantities transported will be measured as follows:<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In gross tonne-kilometres for all costs related to the track and roadway of the Main Railway<br /><br />
Line;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
•<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In train-kilometres for all costs related to Rail Signaling and Communications and train<br /><br />
control.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Track Service Charges” shall mean the charge comprised of:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the direct cost of maintenance, repair and operation of the Main Railway Line and the<br /><br />
Additional Infrastructures and Installations related to it; plus;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the sum of depreciation and financing costs associated with the assets used in the<br /><br />
provision of these services; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a management fee derived by way of a composite overhead ratio comprising a hierarchy<br /><br />
of the various overhead ratios all developed by dividing each overhead category by the<br /><br />
costs of the related direct activities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The direct cost of maintenance, repair and operations of the Main Railway Line and the Additional<br /><br />
Infrastructures and Installations related to it will comprise but not be limited to the cost of:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
maintenance and repair of the Main Railway Line and the Additional Infrastructures<br /><br />
and Installations related to it ;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
train control and incident management;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
inspection, safety and security;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any tax or other duty currently or in the future imposed upon Concessionaire by the<br /><br />
State in connection with the operation, repair and maintenance of the Main Railway<br /><br />
Line and the Additional Infrastructures and Installations related to them (including the<br /><br />
Rail Signaling and Communications), but expressly excluding the costs of CBG’s train<br /><br />
operations and the royalty paid by CBG under the Concession Agreement as well as<br /><br />
any tax, fee, royalty or other charge currently or in the future imposed upon<br /><br />
Concessionaire by the State in connection with the access or use of the Main Railway<br /><br />

maintenance and repairs of the work equipment (rolling stock dedicated to track<br /><br />
maintenance and repair), roadway machines and other ancillary equipment;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vi)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
an appropriate hire charge in relation to the revenue rolling stock which is used in the<br /><br />
maintenance and repair activities; and<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the costs of material and infrastructure works which during the term of this Agreement<br /><br />
are charged to capital but are not captured under Article 18.3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties acknowledge the complexities associated with railway costing and in this regard agree that<br /><br />
where:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
costs are directly incurred, or assets directly used, in the performance of services<br /><br />
and/or other activities related to the maintenance, repair and operations of the Main<br /><br />
Railway Line and the Additional Infrastructures and Installations related to it (the<br /><br />
“Services”), those costs and assets should be directly identified and assigned;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
costs are incurred, or assets are used, in common with respect to the Services, and<br /><br />
where there is a causal relationship between the resources used and the Services,<br /><br />
these costs shall be attributed on a reasonable basis of cost causality; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
assets, costs, and investments are used jointly for the provision of the Services, and<br /><br />
where there is no direct causal relationship between the resources used and the<br /><br />
Services, these costs shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Consistent with these principles, CBG will within two years of the execution of this Agreement prepare a<br /><br />
commercially reasonable costing manual which will include:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a chart of accounts identifying the direct costs, attributed costs and allocated costs,<br /><br />
along with the basis for their identification, attribution and allocation; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a register of assets to be used in the provision of the Services and their values.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The costing manual will be subject to the review and approval of GAC SA; provided that such approval<br /><br />
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Such costing manual shall also be subject<br /><br />
to further revision from time to time in accordance with the preceding process.<br /><br />
The costing manual will present the methods to be used in calculating the management fee. The<br /><br />
Parties may, however, agree on an allocation factor to be used for this purpose in lieu of the application<br /><br />
of the methods presented in the manual.<br /><br />
18.3 GAC SA shall pay a pro rata allocation for the Major Works Charges (as defined below) which<br /><br />
pro rata allocation shall be calculated in the manner set forth in Section 18.2.<br /><br />
For the purpose of this clause, “Major Works Charges” means the costs associated with the major<br /><br />
repair or renewal works relating to the Main Railway Line and the Additional Infrastructures and<br /><br />
Installations related to it (including the Rail Signaling and Communications) identified and agreed to in<br /><br />
the five year rolling plan prepared by the Concessionaire and approved by the Technical Committee.<br /><br />
For the purpose of the above provisions, the Concessionaire shall put in place a cost accounting<br /><br />
system based on the principles outlined for the costing manual in Article 18.2. GAC SA shall have<br /><br />
access to the accounting and financial elements of the Concessionaire related to the costs of<br /><br />
maintenance and major works for the purposes of confirmation and control. GAC SA shall have the<br /><br />
right to have these documents audited, at its own expense, by any certified accountant of its choice,<br /><br />
provided (i) any recipient of such documents and information shall execute a reasonably acceptable<br /><br />
confidentiality agreement; and (ii) a copy of such report(s) shall be provided to the Concessionaire.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Infrastructures, port Additional Infrastructures and Installations (Alumina Dock, Channel, port<br /><br />
installations, including the Lay-down Zone and the New Commercial Dock).<br /><br />
The State has implemented an additional safety charge (ISPS) for any ship accessing or leaving the<br /><br />
Kamsar port; such charge will apply to all ships and its amount will be equivalent to the amount applied<br /><br />
in other ports of the type of Kamsar internationally.<br /><br />
18.7 The acceptation by GAC SA of the bearing of part of the costs related to the major woks pursuant<br /><br />
to Article 18.3 above is only valid for the duration of the Concession Agreement and as long as the<br /><br />
amount of the tariff for the access and use referred to in Article 18.1 remains unchanged. Should any of<br /><br />
these conditions not be any longer met, and in particular, in case of modification of the financial<br /><br />
conditions of the Concession Agreement or the execution of any agreement replacing the Concession<br /><br />
Agreement and having an impact on the tariff paid by GAC SA, the Parties shall meet to discuss the<br /><br />
evolution of the financial modalities of this Infrastructure Agreement, taking into consideration, in<br /><br />
particular, the amounts borne by GAC SA in relation to previous major works. Within this framework, a<br /><br />
new financing mechanism for major works may be put in place, providing for the financing of major<br /><br />
works by the users and the Concessionaire and the repayment of the debt by deduction from the tariff.<br /><br />
26<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The previous tariff shall remain applicable as long as the Parties will not have determined the new<br /><br />
applicable conditions. The State and ANAIM confirm that GAC SA shall be involved in the process of<br /><br />
modification of the Concession Agreement and/or the execution of an agreement with a Successor<br /><br />
Beneficiary.<br /><br />

as GAC SA will so request.<br /><br />
20.3 In case of early termination of the Concession Agreement for whatever reason or its expiration,<br /><br />
the State, GAC SA and CBG will meet to establish a new model for the operation of infrastructures<br /><br />
<br /><br />
28<br /><br />
<br /><br />
which will include an efficient independent professional concessionaire which have all necessary<br /><br />
technical skills to complete its assignment successfully.<br /><br />
In case of early termination of the Concession Agreement for whatever reason or its expiration, the<br /><br />
State guarantees that the Successor Beneficiary shall be bound by the rights granted to GAC SA and<br /><br />
GAC Ltd under the Operations Agreement.<br /><br />
In any case, the State confirms that in all circumstances it guarantees to GAC SA the access to Existing<br /><br />
Infrastructures and to Additional Infrastructures and Installations in accordance with the provisions of<br /><br />
the Basic Agreement.<br /><br />
20.4 In the case of a contradiction between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Basic<br /><br />
Agreement, the latter will prevail. In the case of a contradiction between the provisions of this<br /><br />
Agreement and those of the Operations Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail. This<br /><br />
Infrastructure Agreement does not create any right in favour of CBG, the Concessionaire or any other<br /><br />
Successor Beneficiary, and none of them may rely on it.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 21: GUARANTEE<br /><br />
If for any reason beyond its control, GAC SA is not able to obtain, through ANAIM, any Authorization<br /><br />
whatsoever or the approval of a third party within the deadlines and under the conditions validly or<br /><br />
contractually required, or it is not able to put in place a programme provided for herein within the<br /><br />
required deadlines, or does not have access to the Existing Infrastructures or to the Additional<br /><br />
Infrastructures and Installations or to the Channel on terms enabling it to carry out its activities as set<br /><br />
out in the Basic Agreement, GAC SA shall be entitled to request that ANAIM, by written notification,<br /><br />
remedy the situation in question.<br /><br />
It is specified that the development plan of the Project and the Project Activities within the framework of<br /><br />
the Basic Agreement, at the date of signature hereof, assumes for the first phase that the volume of<br /><br />
production (and of Intrants necessary to assure such production) to transport can reach, after<br /><br />
debottlenecking and optimization, up to 4 million tones of alumina per annum, with possible expansion<br /><br />
in latter stages for additional amounts. The right of access and use guaranteed by the State to GAC SA<br /><br />
under the Basic Agreement and this Infrastructure Agreement shall at all times be at a level which<br /><br />
corresponds to this assumption.<br /><br />
In the event that, for any reason, the situation referred in first paragraph of this Article is not definitively<br /><br />
remedied by ANAIM within a period of thirty (30) days following this notification, ANAIM itself shall<br /><br />
enforce without delay the contractual provisions set out to this effect in the Concession Agreement, and<br /><br />
undertake any other action available under the law against the third parties involved, including the<br /><br />
Concessionaire, so that the said situation is settled definitively and that the guaranties granted by the<br /><br />
State to GAC SA within the Basic Agreement are fully respected.<br /><br />
In the case of a disagreement of GAC SA with the Technical Committee or with the State and/or the<br /><br />
Concessionaire concerning the issues relating to the access, the use or the status or the maintenance<br /><br />
of the Existing Infrastructures, of the Additional Infrastructures and Installations and of the Channel.<br /><br />
ANAIM itself will apply without delay the contractual provisions provided to this effect in the Concession<br /><br />
Agreement as well as any other means or actions vis-à-vis concerned third parties (including the<br /><br />
Concessionaire) opened by the law so that such situations be definitively settled and the guaranties<br /><br />
given by the State to GAC SA in the Basic Agreement be fully respected. The disagreements between<br /><br />
<br /><br />
29<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the State and GAC SA shall be subject to the dispute resolution mechanism provided to this effect in<br /><br />
the Basic Agreement.<br /><br />
The State guarantees GAC SA and commits to indemnify GAC SA for any direct and indirect damages<br /><br />
and to reimburse GAC SA for any loss, expense and cost that it might bear or incur as a result of such<br /><br />
situations. This commitment shall not affect the obligations of the State relating to indemnification or<br /><br />
other rights to the benefit of GAC SA pursuant to the Basic Agreement.<br /><br />
Without prejudice of the right to the State to engage the liability of GAC SA and/or GAC Ltd for the noncompliance with its obligation under the Basic Agreement and/or this Infrastructure Agreement in the<br /><br />
conditions provided for in these agreements, it is understood that the State is not exonerated from its<br /><br />
obligations and undertakings vis-à-vis GAC SA under the Basic Agreement, this Infrastructure<br /><br />
Agreement and the Operations Agreement, including:<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
for the reason of the existence of the Concession Agreement (as well as the basic agreement of<br /><br />
Harvey Alumina Company, as modified) and/or its various provisions and/or references to it (under this<br /><br />
Infrastructure Agreement and/or Operations Agreement), and/or;<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for the reason of:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The participation of GAC SA to the Operations Agreement; and/or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The obligations provided therein for the benefit or against the Concessionaire and/or the<br /><br />
Technical Committee.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions herein do not affect the rights of GAC SA vis-à-vis the State to obtain reparation of all<br /><br />
direct or indirect damages and reimbursement of all losses, costs and expenses which GAC SA would<br /><br />
be subjected to as a result of the conditions of access, use and maintenance affecting the Existing<br /><br />
Infrastructure or the Additional Infrastructures and Installations or the risks of GAC SA to its Direct SubContractors or its clients, of direct or indirect damages losses or additional costs.<br /><br />
Can be enforceable against GAC SA so as to limit the State liability under the Basic Agreement and this<br /><br />
Infrastructure Agreement, only a judgment or arbitral award settling a dispute arising out of the<br /><br />
Operations Agreement and which is in connection with a provision of the Operations Agreement which<br /><br />
has a link with this Infrastructure Agreement.<br /><br />
The provisions of the Concession Agreement do not create obligations for GAC SA outside those<br /><br />
provided for in the agreements between GAC SA and the State.<br /><br />
GAC SA undertakes to comply with its obligations with respect to and under the terms and conditions of<br /><br />
the Operations Agreement. In the event of any contradiction between the provisions of the Operations<br /><br />
Agreement and those of the Infrastructure Agreement, the latter shall prevail.<br /><br />
ANAIM shall take at all times all necessary measures to ensure that GAC SA can access and use the<br /><br />
Existing Infrastructures and the Additional Infrastructures and Installations and the Channel (including<br /><br />
the construction operations and the works related to the Additional Infrastructures and Installations) in<br /><br />
compliance with the provisions of the Basic Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
30<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If ANAIM cannot remedy the difficulties or the adverse conditions of access or operation or<br /><br />
maintenance affecting GAC SA concerning the Existing Infrastructures and the Additional<br /><br />
Infrastructures and Installations and/or the Channel, including in case of strikes of ANAIM or<br /><br />
Concessionaire staff or of situations affecting the normal or efficient operation of such Infrastructures or<br /><br />
in the case of Anomalies affecting the normal course and the security of the transports, ANAIM commits<br /><br />
to appoint without delay any third party professionals of its choice, having the required competence and<br /><br />
experience, whether temporarily or definitively, and at its own cost, in order to ensure a normal and<br /><br />
efficient access, use and maintenance by GAC SA and its Direct Sub-Contractors. If a third party<br /><br />
professional would not be appointed under these conditions, GAC SA will have the right to assure, until<br /><br />
the situation is reestablished, its own needs on transportation, through use of the Existing<br /><br />
Infrastructures, the Additional Infrastructures and Installations and/or the Channel or otherwise, at its<br /><br />
choice, either directly or by a third party professional appointed by GAC SA for this purpose, at its<br /><br />
choice. GAC SA shall have the same right in case of termination or expiry of the Concession<br /><br />
Agreement (Article 20.3 above).<br /><br />
In this regard, GAC SA’s inability to gain access to a utilization which is required for the Project shall be<br /><br />
considered as an inability for GAC SA to access the infrastructures, which shall be considered<br /><br />
according to, and for the purposes of, the Basic Agreement, to be caused by the State.<br /><br />
The State acknowledges that within the context of their financings, GAC SA and/or GAC Ltd shall have<br /><br />
to grant, in accordance with the Basic Agreement, rights to the Lenders, under which the Lenders may<br /><br />
directly or indirectly replace GAC SA and/or GAC Ltd in their rights and obligations under the Basic<br /><br />
Agreement. In this case, the State guarantees GAC SA that it shall ensure that the successor shall<br /><br />
benefit from the rights and obligations resulting from this Infrastructure Agreement and the Operations<br /><br />
Agreement, in accordance with the Basic Agreement.<br /><br />
The State guarantees to GAC SA and GAC Ltd the continuity of the rights and guarantees which are<br /><br />
granted to them under this Infrastructure Agreement and this, in particular, for the whole duration of the<br /><br />
Project and notwithstanding any mutation which could occur in CBG.<br /><br />
On its side, GAC SA undertakes vis-à-vis the State and ANAIM to comply with the obligations and fulfil<br /><br />
the guarantees for which it is responsible under this Infrastructure Agreement. GAC SA shall be liable<br /><br />
for the breach of its undertakings under the conditions provided in Article 17 here above. In particular,<br /><br />
GAC SA undertakes to comply with the Rules of the Art (including the safety and environmental<br /><br />
applicable rules) during the carrying out of the works planed in this Infrastructure Agreement, what the<br /><br />
State and ANAIM recognize and accept.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 22: DURATION<br /><br />
This Infrastructure Agreement is entered into for a duration starting on the Effective Date. In accordance<br /><br />
with article 11.1 of the Basic Agreement pursuant to which the State guarantees to GAC SA a right of<br /><br />
access and use of the Existing Infrastructure (including the Channel) for the whole duration of the Basic<br /><br />
Agreement as defined in article 34.2.1 of the Basic Agreement, this Infrastructure Agreement shall<br /><br />
remain in force with full effect for a duration equivalent to that of the Basic Agreement, whoever may be<br /><br />
the Concessionaire of the Common Infrastructures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
31<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 23: ASSIGNMENT, SUBSTITUTION, NEW PARTY<br /><br />
GAC SA may assign, transfer, pledge or alienate, and transfer by any other means, its rights and<br /><br />
obligations under this Infrastructure Agreement to any Affiliated Company and to any entity for the<br /><br />
benefit of any Lender.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 24: SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES, APPLICABLE LAW, PAYMENT,<br /><br />
INTERESTS<br /><br />
It is noted that the provisions of the Basic Agreement for the settlement of disputes, regarding the<br /><br />
applicable law, “payment” (conditions of implementation of the decisions) of the payable interests, are<br /><br />

immunity right for itself and its properties for the purposes of any final decision or judgement to be taken<br /><br />
in this regard.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 25: INDEMNIFICATION<br /><br />
25.1 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 21 above, the State guarantees GAC SA against all<br /><br />
direct and indirect damages, and shall indemnify it against all direct or indirect damage, loss, cost and<br /><br />
expense sustained or incurred by GAC SA in the event of a breach by ANAIM or by the State of the<br /><br />
provisions of this Infrastructure Agreement or in the event of an impossibility or delay incurred by GAC<br /><br />
SA in the setting-up of the work of design, construction, development or other actions set out by this<br /><br />
Agreement or provided in the Basic Agreement and its annexes and by this Agreement.<br /><br />
It shall be the responsibility of ANAIM or the State to initiate legal action against any third party which<br /><br />
might be liable in whole or in part for the situations giving entitlement to these indemnifications and<br /><br />
repayments to the benefit of GAC SA.<br /><br />
25.2 ANAIM and the State undertake to fully collaborate with GAC SA and to provide to it all<br /><br />
necessary assistance in the event of a claim by the Concessionaire or by any third party against GAC<br /><br />
SA as a result of the implementation and application of this Infrastructure Agreement in accordance<br /><br />
with its terms. Any cost, expense, charge, penalty and other expense incurred by GAC SA in this<br /><br />
respect shall be borne and/or reimbursed by ANAIM and/or the State.<br /><br />
The provisions of this Infrastructure Agreement shall not affect or limit in any way the provisions relating<br /><br />
to indemnification set out in the Basic Agreement for the benefit of GAC SA or those of article 19.1 of<br /><br />
the Basic Agreement (in its language provided by Amendment n°1).<br /><br />
ARTICLE 26: FORCE MAJEURE<br /><br />
The provisions of article 38 of the Basic Agreement shall apply as of right to the Parties in respect of<br /><br />
Force Majeure under this Infrastructure Agreement.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 27: NON WAIVER<br /><br />
Unless expressly waived in writing, the fact that one Party does not exercise in whole or in part the<br /><br />
rights which are conferred on it by this Infrastructure Agreement shall not constitute in any case an<br /><br />
abandonment of the rights which it has not exercised.<br /><br />

Channel improvements<br /><br />
To allow the increase in the sea traffic in the Port of Kamsar related to the Project, no deepening or<br /><br />
widening work will be necessary in the Channel. The Channel is currently maintained to – 9.0 m.<br /><br />
For safe operation of the GAC SA Alumina Dock it be will be necessary to create by dredging a turning<br /><br />
basin opposite the GAC SA quay that will allow CBG empty ships to wait at anchor safely clear of the<br /><br />
GAC SA Alumina Dock without causing any restriction to the GAC SA shipping operation and viceversa. Any future extensions related to the Project shall require a detailed study of the Parties and the<br /><br />
approval of the Technical Committee.<br /><br />
Any material dredged will be deposited in disposal sites approved by the Management of the Kamsar<br /><br />
Port.<br /><br />

Annex 3 H – Capacity allocation principles<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A capacity assessment using a proven methodology will be undertaken to determine<br /><br />
"absolute daily capacity" (“Capacity”).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any portion of Capacity allocated to a user (“User”) will be nominated “Allocated<br /><br />
Capacity”. A portion of Capacity which is not used will be nominated “Unallocated<br /><br />
Capacity”.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Concessionaire must make a register of the Allocated Capacity and the Unallocated<br /><br />
Capacity (the “Capacity Register”), keep it current and publish it at least twice per year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a User wants to be allocated a portion of Capacity, it makes a request to the<br /><br />
Concessionaire, which allocates the Capacity on a “first come, first served” basis.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Unallocated Capacity is sufficient for the User requirements, the User will be allocated<br /><br />
such Capacity and will pay for that Allocated Capacity.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Once Capacity is allocated, and as long as the use of the Capacity is being paid, the<br /><br />
capacity will remain allocated for the entire duration of a User’s project.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Should there be insufficient, Unallocated Capacity to accommodate the User requirements,<br /><br />
he or the State will fund the necessary works to create additional Capacity (“Additional<br /><br />
Capacity”) and he will be allocated sufficient of this for his requirements. He will pay for that<br /><br />
Additional Capacity and the charge will take account of the manner in which the Additional<br /><br />
Capacity has been funded, whether by the State or by the User.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Additional Capacity allocated to the User will be nominated as Allocated Capacity and<br /><br />
recorded as such in the Capacity Register.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any Additional Capacity not used by the User will be nominated as Unallocated Capacity<br /><br />
and recorded as such in the Capacity Register.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any Unallocated Capacity can be accessed by the Concessionaire on an ad-hoc basis for<br /><br />
the benefit of all Users.<br /><br />
