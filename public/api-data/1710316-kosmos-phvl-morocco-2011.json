Of note, where hydrocarbons are discovered in the last year of the Second Extension Period, the parties may jointly apply for an exceptional period as provided by local law. In the Initial Period, the Contractor Group must conduct minimum exploration with an estimated value of $4 Million including: a post-mortem study of previous wells drilled in the area and of acquisition and processing parameters of available 3D Seismic of the Area of Interest; update the geological model; acquire, process and interpret 500 km2 3D Seismic; reinterpret available 2D and 2D Seismic data; post-processing seismic special studies; risk and rank prospects; and economic evaluation. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the Initial Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the First Extension Period. In the First Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $40 Million, the Contractor Group must engage in well planning and drill an exploration well either with a minimum depth of 2500 meters below seabed or to the cretaceous objective, whichever is penetrated first. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the First Extension Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the Second Extension Period. In the Second Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $40 Million, the Contractor Group must conduct a post mortem study of the well drilled in the First Extension Period; specially recalibrate available 3D seismic based on well results; drill an exploration to the lower cretaceous or a minimum depth of 2500 meters below seabed, whichever is penetrated first. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the Second Extension Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration. To guarantee the Minimum Exploration Work Program, the Contractor Group must pay $2 Million bank guarantee no later than the signature of this agreement;  this bank guarantee will be reduced to $1,000,000 upon the Contractor Group providing field tapes and data in support; the bank guarantee will again be reduced by a further $500,000 upon provision of the 3D seismic data; and the final $500,000 will be returned upon the Contractor Group's provision of all reports relating to the work conducted in the Initial Period. Each time the Contractor Group enters an Extension Period, it must a $5 Million guarantee and provide a drilling contract for the committed well. Failure to provide a drilling contract increases the Contractor Group's bank guarantee to $12 Million.--Art. 3.3, art. 3.4., art. 4",
