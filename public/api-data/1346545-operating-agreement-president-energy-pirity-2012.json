                "content":"Where a dispute arises Pirity and President, the disputing party must notify the other party of the dispute and proceed to negotions between the Senior Executive of both parties. Where Pirity and President are unable to resolve a dispute by negotiation as set out in Art. 18.2(B), then the dispute will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by 3 arbitrators unless the parties to the dispute agree to a sole arbitrator within 30 days of filing for arbitration. Where there are 2 parties to the dispute, they will each appoint one arbitrator within 30 days. Within a further 30 days, the two appointed arbitrators will appoint a third arbitrator. If the parties or arbitrators fail to make these appointments, then an arbitrator will be appointed by the ICC Arbitral Institution. If there are more than two parties to the dispute, then, within 30 days of filing for arbitration, all claimants must jointly appoint one arbitrator and all respondents must do the same. As with a two party dispute, these two appointed arbitrators must then select a third arbitrator within a further 30 days. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English and the the costs of arbitration will be paid as provided in the award. The arbitration will take place anywhere in Bogota, Colombia, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If the parties initiate multiple arbitration proceedings that are related to common questions of law and that could result in conflicting awards or obligations, all these common proceedings may be consolidated into a single arbitral proceeding. --Art. 18.2",

The Non-Operator may audit Joint Account and records of the Operator relating to acounting for any calendar year within the 24 month period (following the end of said calendar year).  The cost of the audit must be paid by the party requesting the audit. Where the Operator is required by law or the Contract to employ a public accounting firm to audit, the cost of the audit shall be charged to the Joint Account and a copy of the final audit shall be provided to each Party. Where there are two or more Non-Operators conducting an audit, they must make reasonable effort to conduct joint or simultaneous audits. The Non-Operator may request information from the Operator within 30 days prior to the commencement of the audit. At the end of the audit, the Party conducting the audit must prepare and distribute a written report to the Operator and all the Parties who participated in the audit as soon as possible (and within 90 days of the conclusion of the audit). The Opertor must then make reasonable effort to respond to the report within a further 90 days of the receipt of the report. Non-Operators have the right to conduct further investigation if they consider the report or the reply to require further investigation (even if the 24 month period has expired). The further investigation must commence within 30 days and be concluded within 60 days after the receipt of the report or reply.    --Exhibit A (Art. 1.8)",
