                "content":"Any dispute between the Liberian government and LIBINC Oil Palm Inc. arising out of or in relation to the contract will be settled by binding arbitration, unless specifically provided elsewhere in the contract for resolution by submission to an expert. The arbitration will be under the rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) effective on the date the contract comes into force. There will be three arbitrators. Arbitration proceedings will be held in English, in Washington, D.C. or such other place the parties mutually agree, subject to the approval of the Center and arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal will determine how the costs of the proceedings (costs and fees incurred and imposed by the Centre and the arbitrators) are assessed between the two parties. Each party will pay for its own costs and attorney fees. Any procedural issue that can't be determined under the rules of ICSID will be determined under the governing law. The arbitrators, by majority vote, render a written decision and publicly state it within 3 months after the hearing has concluded. Any monetary award will be payable in dollars through a bank designated by the recipient and any award to LIBINC Oil Palm Inc. will not be subject to taxes and duties. Neither party will have liability for consequential damages or exemplary or punitive damages. Interest will be applied at a rate of LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus one percentage point from the date of the award until satisfaction. If LIBOR is no longer reported, then another agreed substitute rate should be applied. If the decision of the arbitral tribunal is adverse to either party, the tribunal, in its discretion, may allow a grace period to cure defect or default, up to 180 days from the time that payment would have been required. The Liberian government waives any defense related to sovereign immunity. The right to refer a claim or dispute to arbitration will not be affected by the fact that either party has received partial compensation from another person for a loss or injury related to the claim or dispute. That person may participate in the proceedings. The award may contain orders such as specific performance, setoff, other equitable relief or monetary damage. The parties will take all actions necessary to completely fulfill the award, which is binding and enforceable against them. The consent to jurisdiction of ICSID will equally bind any successors or successors-in-interest to each party. Should ICSID be replaced by or functions transferred to another international organization, the parties will have the right to submit any dispute to that body for settlement. If ICSID ceases to exist without replacement, the parties may submit disputes to other centers mutually agreed upon. At all times, the right to arbitration is fully binding on both parties. LIBINC Oil Palm Inc. is authorized to continue operations consistent with the terms of the contract during the pendency of a decision of a referee or arbitral tribunal. At the request of either party and subject to approval by the other party, any matter can instead be referred to a single referee appointed by the Secretary General of ICSID. Referring the matter to a single referee does not apply to disputes arising out of provisions of the contract related to the grant of rights, conduct of operations, income taxation, surface rental, payments to Liberian government, financial reporting and currency; records, reports and inspection; termination; disposition of assets; governing law; periodic review and survival and severability provisions; unless the parties agree the dispute is not material. The decision of the referee will be final and binding unless appealed by either party to arbitrators who will examine the decision only as to manifest error of law, findings of fact not supported by credible evidence, and abuse of authority, misconduct or other unauthorized act by the referee.--Art. 24.1, 24.4 and 1.6\n",
