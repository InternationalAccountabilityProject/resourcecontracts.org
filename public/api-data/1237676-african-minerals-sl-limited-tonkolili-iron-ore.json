An annual allowance equal to 20% of the USD cost of qualifying capital expenditure will be deductible in determining taxable income in each subsequent year until the full cost has been deducted. Where an asset that falls within the definition of qualifying capital expenditure is scrapped, destroyed or sold for less than the balance obtained by deducting the total allowances previously granted in respect of the asset from the cost thereof, then this balance will be fully deductible as a scrapping allowance against taxable income in the year in which the disposal, destruction or sale occurs. The cost of restoring qualifying capital expenditure will be considered a repair of the asset and allowable in full as a deduction against taxable income in the year during which the cost was incurred, provided that the restoration does not increase the productive capacity of the asset. African Minerals and its subsidiaries can choose to defer claiming deductions for their qualifying or deductible expenditures (in full or in part) and claim the relevant allowances in subsequent years; Treatment of Losses for Income Tax Purposes: Assessable losses incurred by African Minerals and its subsidiaries can be carried forward for offset against taxable income in the 10 years subsequent to the year in which the loss was incurred, and there is no limitation on the amount of losses that can be used to offset against taxable income in any year; Specific Deductions for Income Tax Purposes: African Minerals and its subsidiaries can claim deductions against taxable income in an amount equal to 100% of the cost of certain items of environmental, social and educational expenditure listed in Art. 19(g)(i). Deductions related to interest expense incurred in respect of the Company's debt obligations is subject to Section 35 of the Income Tax Act 2000. Certain costs related to acquiring licences, removing waste, community improvements, and employee air ticket fares are also fully deductible in the year incurred. Dividends, interest and fees paid from one resident company of the African Minerals Group to another are not deductible or assessable. Where assets that are included in the definition of qualifying capital expenditure are transferred between companies within the Group, the value at which they are transferred shall be deemed to be their adjusted cost base;  Taxable income and income tax payable by African Minerals and its subsidiaries will be assessed and payable in USD. --Arts. 19 (e-g, i) \n",
