For the first quarter from production of the first tonne of hydrocarbon, Factor R will be considered to be less than or equal to 1.

Tax on Profit Oil: Petrochad must pay tax on Profit Oil in cash or in kind. Chad must notify Petrochad ofa method of payment no less than 90 days before the production of the first tonne of hydrocarbon; the method of payment will remain in effect unless Chad changes it, with 180 days notice to Petrochad.
