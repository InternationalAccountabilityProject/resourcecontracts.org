It will start the construction no later than 84 months after the first commercial shipping. If the state does not elect to do so, the mine project company must designate one or more third parties approved by the state to build, own and/or operate a beneficiation power station capable in quantity and quality to supply enough power for the beneficiation operations.\n\nThe railway and mineral terminal must allow transportation of the sales products, other ores and other iron ore from within the territory of the state (as long as the transportation, by nature, has no adverse effects on the collection, unloading, storage, loading and shipment of the sale products and other ores and transportation of the goods, Nabeba goods and any other goods agreed upon). The railway will not transport passengers or equipment, materials, and other goods not intended for the project or Nabeba except in the cases provided. The railway must be initially built to handle 35 million tonnes of ore in a calendar year.\nHowever, the railway and mineral terminal must be suited to eventually handle the design capacity of the agreements without materially adversely impacting initial capacity and extension capacity (which add up to the design capacity), or technical aspects of the railway haulage services and mineral terminal services up to the design capacity. The state may at its discretion choose by the date of entry into force to fund the costs required to build out the foundation for a dual track design. In such event, the state, Cam Iron, the Railway project company and the mineral terminal project company will agree to modify the convention and agreements to the extent necessary. The parties may enter into discussion for Cam Iron or its subsidiaries to fund a portion of the costs in exchange for additional expansion capacity.\nThe railway project company must maintain and keep the railway facilities in sound working order and in accordance with the convention and operating standards and conduct all the works necessary and all the repairs of any damages that occur, in compliance with the railway agreement.\n\nThe mineral terminal must allow the collection, unloading, storage and loading and shipment of the sales products, other ores and other iron ore within the territory of the state (as long as these activities, by nature, have no adverse effects on the collection, unloading, storage, loading and shipment of the sale products and other ores, and of the goods, Nabeba goods and any other goods agreed upon). The mineral terminal must also allow the conduct of blending operations; the initial lease for the mineral terminal area may upon agreement include the land necessary to reach design capacity. Specifications will be given to the project company by the state and after review, both will agree on specifications to be recorded in the mineral terminal agreement. Cam Iron, or the Mineral Terminal project company, as applicable, will operate the mineral terminal to handle initial capacity and expansion capacity up to design capacity, and incorporate technical aspects of  the mineral terminal services being provided to any party up to design capacity. The mineral terminal project company must also operate the mineral terminal to provide any expansion capacity that may be built and provide adequate working capital to finance its operations related to expansion capacity. The mineral terminal project company will maintain and keep the facilities in sound working order and in accordance with this convention and operating standards, and conduct all the works necessary and all the repairs of any damages that could occur in compliance with the agreement.\nA hydrocarbon facility must be established by the mineral terminal project company directly or by its contractor in the mineral terminal, suitable for the import, storage and distribution of hydrocarbon products. \n\nThe Project Roads shall be built specifically to allow for the construction and maintenance vehicles of a Project Company and its Contractors and Subcontractors to use the Project Roads during the construction of the Mainline Railway and Initial Spur Lines. Within the 3 year period after project commissioning, the project companies will:\n- provide a metallic surfacing on the project road adjacent to the railway from Lolabe to the intersection of an existing unpaved state road near Endenge,\n- provide a metallic surfacing for the existing road form where it connects to the project road adjacent to the railway to Mbelem to where it intersects with the existing state road from Sangmelima to Ouesso,\n- connect with the existing road from Sangmelima to Ouesso until the road intersects with the project road adjacent to the railway and\n- provide a metallic surface to the final portion o fthe project road adjacent to the railway from the intersection with the existing road from Sangmelima to Ouesso to Mbarga.

If the dispute was not resolved by amicable settlement, a party may only raise the claim under the dispute resolution provisions of the ICSID convention. Arbitration and ICSID claims are exclusive from one another (no parallel, successive, or duplicate actions are admitted from the same alleged acts)\nThe parties will seek an amicable settlement of any dispute and try to negotiate an amicable resolution, but are under no obligation to agree on a settlement. If the dispute has not been resolved within 60 days of the dispute notification (or any other period agreed upon by the parties), any party may initiate an amicable resolution procedure. The companies and the government must continue the performance of the contractual operations and obligations during any dispute, except when a specific operation or obligation cannot be undertaken or completed without the resolution.\nIn a technical dispute, the parties must submit the matter to a confidential, administered expertise proceedings in English and French, under the Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce (or the contract, where different). The dispute will be heard by an impartial and independent expert with recognized, professional, and relevant experience (unless agreed otherwise in writing) and the parties will bear the costs equally. The party submitting a resolution request to the ICC must propose an expert; the responding parties must agree to the appointment under 90 days or nominate another expert. If the parties have not reached an agreement within 90 days (or another term agreed upon in writing), the ICC International Centre for Expertise will appoint the expert. The expert will deliver the draft report of the findings within 90 days (unless agreed otherwise). The parties have 10 days to comment, after which the expert has 10 days to deliver the decision. The decision will be binding on the parties unless and until it is revised in an amicable settlement or arbitral award. It will be final unless party notifies its dissatisfaction within 30 days. Otherwise, of if the expert does not hand in the decision on time, the dispute will be referred to arbitration. If a party fails to comply, the failure may be referred to arbitration.\nAny unresolved dispute not excluded will be settled confidentially under the rules of arbitration of the ICC (and the contract, where different) in Paris, and in both French and English. The dispute will be heard by 3 impartial and independent arbitrators. Each side will nominate one arbitrator (if necessary, several parties jointly). To the maximum extent permitted by law, the state on the one hand and the project parties on the other shall retain their respective abilities to nominate one arbitrator each. If an arbitrator fails to be appointed within 90 days of commencement of arbitration, or if the two arbitrators, once appointed, fail to appoint the third within 30 days, the ICC will make the appointment. No remedy proceedings before Cameroonian jurisdictions (unless specifically agreed in writing or required under international norms) will be required for arbitration. The arbitration award will be final and binding. The parties will bear their own costs and share equally the costs of the panel.--Art. 56",
