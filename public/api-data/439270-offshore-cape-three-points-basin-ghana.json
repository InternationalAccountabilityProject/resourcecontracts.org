The AOE is a multi-tier, rate-of-return-based mechanism, which captures a share of net cash flows that exceed stipulated thresholds. Net cash flow for the AOE for any month is calculated as total revenues received after payment of royalties (the contractor\u2019s cost oil plus share of profit oil), less income taxes and allowable costs (excluding interest payments), and subtracting cumulative negative net cash flows in the preceding month (which are adjusted based on a stipulated real rate of return). \n\nFor each tier of the AOE formula, the state collects a share of the cumulative positive net cash flow, with any resulting payments then subtracted for purposes of the net cash flow calculation in the next tier of the AOE. This share is collected only once the threshold Rate of Return (RoR) of each tier is reached.\n\nThe tiers start at a threshold of a real RoR of 12.5% and from one tier to the other there is an increment of 5% in the RoR, reaching a threshold RoR of 27.5% for the fourth account. The State\u2019s AOE for the First Account is 10% of the positive net cash flow, for the second account 12% , for the their account 16%, and finally 20% for the fourth account.\n\nNo AOE is collected below a threshold RoR of 12.5%.--Art. 10.2\n",
