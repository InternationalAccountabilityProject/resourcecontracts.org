The parties agree that the contract and the concessionaire's operations constitute an \u201cinvestment\u201d by reason of the expenditure of a considerable amount in the Republic and any dispute subject to these provisions is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment. Either party to such dispute may institute arbitration proceedings by giving notice to the other and to the Secretary-General of the Centre, including a statement of the issues in dispute.\nNotwithstanding the incorporation in the Republic of any of the concessionaire's successors or assignees, or of any of its other affiliates, all such entities will be treated for purposes of arbitration as nationals of the United Kingdom for purposes of the Convention and of this agreement, except if the concessionaire and any other such entity elects to be treated instead as a national of any other state of which, under the Convention, international law or the law of such state or country, it is a national.\nAny arbitration tribunal constituted pursuant to this contract will consist of 1 arbitrator to be appointed by the Government, 1 by the concessionaire and 1, the president of the tribunal and a citizen neither of the Republic nor of Cyprus (or any other state of which a party is a national) to be appointed by the Secretary-General of the Centre. No arbitrator will have an interest in the matters in dispute, or in the parties.\nAs a request of a party, any matter otherwise subject to arbitration under the agreement may instead by referred for resolution to a single referee appointed by the Secretary-General of the Centre, or of any successor entity, except for any dispute arising out of articles 3, 6 and 29 of the agreement, which must be referred to arbitrators unless the parties agree that any such dispute is not material, in which event it may be referred to the referee for decision at the option of either party. The decision of the referee will be rendered pursuant to article 31.6 of the contract (except as regards the requirement for a decision by majority vote) and will be final and binding unless appealed by any party to arbitrators, who must examine the referee's decision only as to manifest errors of law, findings of fact that are not supported by any credible evidence, and abuse of authority, misconduct or other unauthorized act by the referee.\nArbitration proceedings will be held in Brussels, Belgium or such other place as the parties agree and will be in English. The arbitration tribunal will assess and distribute the costs. Any procedural issues that cannot be determined under the arbitral rules of the Centre will be determined pursuant to applicable law.\nThe arbitrators will by majority vote render a written award stating reasons. Any monetary award must be assessed and payable in dollars (at prevailing market rate of exchange if the award involved an obligation in another currency) through a bank designated by the recipient. In the case of an award to the concessionaire, the award will be exempt from any taxes and duties. Each party must bear its own costs and attorney fees. Neither party to the proceedings will have any liability for either consequential damages (except for purposes of set off) or exemplary or punitive damages. Interest at a rate not to exceed the London Interbank Offering Rate existing at the time of such award, plus 1%, multiplied by the amount of the award, will be assessed from the date of any monetary award until its satisfaction. If LIBOR should cease to be reported, then the rate to be applied shall be another substitute rate agreed to by a majority of the tribunal. If the tribunal's award is adverse to the concessionaire, the arbitration tribunal may specify a reasonable period of grace to cure any defect or default on the part of the concessionaire, provided that such period not exceed 180 days for the making of any payment by such award.\nThe Government waives irrevocably, unreservedly and unconditionally all claims to sovereign immunity from the arbitrator's jurisdiction, and from the enforcement of any arbitral award rendered by a tribunal constituted pursuant to the agreement, including from service of process and from the jurisdiction of any court in any state, country or nation.\nThe right to refer a claim or dispute to arbitration will not be affected by the fact that a claimant or respondent has received full or partial compensation from another person for a loss or injury that is the object of the claim or dispute, and any other such person may participate in such proceedings by right of subrogation.\nThe consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre will equally bind any successor of or successors-in-interest to either party. Should the Centre be replaced by, or its functions be substantially conferred upon or be transferred to, any new international body of a similar type and competence, the parties will have the right to submit any dispute to such body for settlement by arbitration.--31",
