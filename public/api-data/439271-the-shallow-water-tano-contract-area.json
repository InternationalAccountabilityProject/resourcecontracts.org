Net cash flow for the AOE for any month is calculated as total revenues received after payment of royalties (the contractor\u2019s cost oil plus share of profit oil), less income taxes and allowable costs (excluding interest payments), and subtracting cumulative negative net cash flows in the preceding month (which are adjusted based on a stipulated real rate of return). \nFor each tier of the AOE formula, the state collects a share of the cumulative positive net cash flow, with any resulting payments then subtracted for purposes of the net cash flow calculation in the next tier of the AOE. This share is collected only once the  threshold Rate of Return (RoR) of each tier is reached.\nThe tiers start at a threshold of a real RoR of 18% and from one tier to the next there is an increment of 5% in the RoR, reaching a threshold RoR of 33%% for the fourth account. The State\u2019s AOE for the First Account (ie first tier) is 10% of the positive net cash flow, for the Second Account (ie second tier) is 15% , for the Third Account (ie third tier) is 20%, and finally, for the Fourth Account (fourth tier) is 25%.\nNo AOE is collected below a threshold RoR of 18%\n\n--Section 10.2\"\n",
