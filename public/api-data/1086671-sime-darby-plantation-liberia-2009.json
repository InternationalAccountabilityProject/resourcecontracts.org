Each member will have one vote and the chairperson will only use his vote in the event of a tie. The chairperson will issue a notice and agenda for the first meeting, which will be held no later than 3 weeks after the winding up commission is established. After, periodic meetings should be held at least once each calendar month. Sime Darby Plantation should present to the winding up commission a detailed status report on operations so that the commission can recommend steps to the Liberian government to preserve the viability of the enterprise, employment in the area, and the centers of population. At the request of the Liberian government, the winding up commission will establish plans for full or partial cessation of operations, including the disposition of assets and their demolition or removal. At the request of either party, any meeting of the winding up commission may be held outside of Liberia and the requesting party will be responsible for the travel costs of the participants. Sime Darby Plantation may choose not to participate on the  winding up commission, in which event its only obligations are to provide a detailed status report on operations.--Art. 26.5\n",

                "content":"Immovable assets: Upon termination of the contract, all permanent non-movable tangible assets of Sime Darby Plantation (including rubber trees and oil palms) in the concession area will become property of the Liberian government without charge. If Sime Darby Plantation terminates the contract due to the Liberian government's failure to comply with its obligations, the above-mentioned assets are to be bought by the Liberian government at their fair market value. Such fair market value will be agreed to by parties, and if not so agreed within 28 days of the contract's termination, either party may give notice of intention to refer the matter to an independent valuer, who will be jointly appointed by both parties. If not appointed within 10 days of such notice, either party can request that the independent valuer be appointed by the International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the provisions for appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce. Movable Assets:  If Sime Darby Plantation wishes to sell any of its movable assets located in Liberia, the Liberian government will enjoy priority to purchase them at a fair market price, paid in dollars. If the Liberian government does not use this option within 60 days of being informed of the sale, Sime Darby Plantation may sell the asset to any other person, including the Liberian government or its affiliate, for any price it can obtain or remove the assets from Liberia. The proceeds of such sale will go to Sime Darby Plantation, subject to taxes or duties. If the Liberian government purchases any asset, it shall pay the purchase price within 60 days of the price being agreed upon, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Liberian government can provide notice to Sime Darby Plantation within one year of termination of the contract and require reasonable disposal or removal of movable assets, including unusable assets, remaining within the concession area. If Sime Darby Plantation does not reasonably dispose of or remove assets within a reasonable period, the Liberian government may complete the disposal or removal at the expense of Sime Darby Plantation, but Sime Darby Plantation is entitled to any income received from salvage of those assets.--Art. 27\n",

                "content":"Any dispute between the Liberian government and Sime Darby Plantation arising out of or in relation to the contract shall be settled by binding arbitration, unless specifically provided elsewhere in the contract for resolution by submission to an expert. The arbitration shall be under the rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) effective on the date the contract comes into force. In the event of conflict between ICSID rules and the contract, the contract prevails. Either party to the contract may institute arbitration proceedings by giving notice to the other party and the Secretary General of ICSID. Each party appoints one arbitrator, and the Secretary General of ICSID will appoint a third arbitrator who is neither a citizen of Liberia or Malaysia and will serve as president of the arbitral tribunal. All arbitrators will be qualified to serve as arbitrators in the matter submitted and none will have an interest in the matter. Arbitration proceedings will be held in English, in Washington, D.C. or such other place the parties mutually agree, subject to the approval of the Centre and arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal will determine how the costs of the proceedings (costs and fees incurred and imposed by the Centre and the arbitrators) are assessed between the two parties. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorney fees. Any procedural issue that can't be determined under the rules of ICSID will be determined under the governing law. The arbitrators, by majority vote, render a written decision and publicly state it within 3 months after the hearing has concluded. Any monetary award shall be payable in dollars through a bank designated by the recipient and any award to Sime Darby Plantation will not be subject to taxes and duties. Neither party shall have liability for consequential damages or exemplary or punitive damages. Interest shall be applied at a rate of LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus one percentage point from the date of the award until satisfaction. If LIBOR is no longer reported, then another agreed substitute rate should be applied. If the decision of the arbitral tribunal is adverse to either party, the tribunal, in its discretion, may allow a grace period to cure defect or default, up to 180 days from the time that payment would have been required. The Liberian government waives any defense related to sovereign immunity. The right to refer a claim or dispute to arbitration will not be affected by the fact that either party has received partial compensation from another person for a loss or injury related to the claim or dispute. That person may participate in the proceedings. The award may contain orders such as specific performance, setoff, other equitable relief or monetary damage. The parties shall take all actions necessary to completely fulfill the award which is binding and enforceable against them. The consent to jurisdiction of ICSID shall equally bind any successors or successors-in-interest to each party. Should ICSID be replaced by or functions transferred to another international organization, the parties will have the right to submit any dispute to that body for settlement. If ICSID ceases to exist without replacement, the parties may submit disputes to other centers mutually agreed upon. At all times, the right to arbitration is fully binding on both parties. Sime Darby Plantation is authorized to continue operations consistent with the terms of the contract during the pendency of a decision of a referee or arbitral tribunal. At the request of either party and subject to approval by the other party, any matter can instead be referred to a single referee appointed by the Secretary General of ICSID. Referring the matter to a single referee does not apply to disputes arising out of provisions of the contract related to the grant of rights, conduct of operations, income taxation, surface rental, payments to Liberian government, financial reporting and currency; records, reports and inspection; termination; disposition of assets; governing law; periodic review and survival and severability provisions; unless the parties agree the dispute is not material. The decision of the referee will be final and binding unless appealed by either party to arbitrators who shall examine the decision only as to manifest error of law, findings of fact not supported by credible evidence, and abuse of authority, misconduct or other unauthorized act by the referee. --Art.28\n",
