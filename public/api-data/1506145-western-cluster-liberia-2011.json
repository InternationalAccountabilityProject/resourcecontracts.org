The company must conduct its operations in accordance with applicable law, World Bank/IFC Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines for Mining, IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, the approved EMP and the contract. In any event, it must take appropriate preventive measures to protect all streams and water bodies within or bordering Liberia, all dry land surfaces, and the atmosphere from pollution, contamination or damage resulting from operations. If operations violate the requirements or have material adverse impact on the environment, the company must restore the environment as much as possible to its original and natural state (or remediate the negative impact where restauration is impractical) and take preventive measures to avoid further deterioration of the environment. Restauration and remediation do not require the company to cease operating so long as the company is diligent in undertaking those tasks. The company will not be liable for any negative environmental impact within the exploration, production, or otherwise operating areas existing before the beginning of exploration or operations, or resulting from the acts or omissions by third parties before operations or exploration.\n\nThe company must deliver an environmental report to the Minister within 60 days of the anniversary of the grant of the mining license including an assessment of the production areas under the license and any other area where the company conducts operations. The company must deliver every two years and on the last day of the mining term an environmental audit and assessment of the production areas under the license and any other areas where the company operates, performed or supervised by an  environmental consultant who is a registered engineer or scientist with 10 years' experience in environmental compliance assessments and audits, not regularly employed by the company, and agreed upon by the Minister. The audit and assessment must determine whether operations in the period are conducted in conformity with the requirements. They must also assess the status of the company's provision for restauration or remediation, as well as any changes in the balance of their dedicated accounts.\n\nThe Social Impact Assessment must set forth the potential adverse impact of the construction and operation of each mine, and the related mining plant and infrastructure on the individuals and communities resident in and around:\n- each proposed production area, mining plant or infrastructure;\n- areas affected by the processing or transport of product using infrastructure or facilities provided by the company, or equipment provided by the company, the government, or third parties.\nThe Social Action Plan must foresee reasonable measures, in light of the costs involved, for the mitigation of the adverse impact as well as make provision for the continuing economic and social visibility of centers of population that have formed and may form as a result of operations.\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report and the Environmental Management Plan (EIA and EMP) must comply with EPA requirements. The EIA must at at least identify pre-existing environmental conditions and foresee the potential adverse impact of the construction and operation of the mining plant. The infrastructure of the feasibility report must take into account all activities or improvements to be undertaken by the company. The EMP must at least set forth detailed plans consistent with the EIA for the mitigation of environmental harm attributed to the implementation of the development plan and operations, and the restoration or remediation of the environment to the extent affected. It must in any event comply with applicable EPA requirements.\nThe EMP must include a closure management plan and a closure management budget designed to ensure that upon closure:\n- no proposed mining plant and infrastructure presents any health or safety issues (including provision for the control of acid drainage and long-term environmental hazards) and\n- each proposed production area and the surroundings of any mining plant or infrastructure is restored to productive use or reforested, or where restoration is impractical, suitably remediated.\nThe closure management plan must include a list and assessment of risk and any uncertainties associated with the preferred closure option, address the social aspects of closure and rehabilitation, and provide a process for participation by the community and other stakeholders in closure management and monitoring. The closure management budget must provide a realistic initial estimate of the closure cost, broken down by principal activities. Notwithstanding any other applicable provision, the Government acknowledges that the Bomi and Mano river deposits have been mined in the past by third parties; this contract will not impose on the company, its shareholders, affiliates or subcontractors any closure or responsibilities regarding work performed by third parties.\nThe EMP must explain how the company will finance the environmental restoration and remediation obligations. The company will, at its election:\n- agree in writing with the Government to a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d funding scheme or\n- provide financial obligations in a letter of credit reasonably acceptable to the minister of finance and the minister, issued on behalf of the company from a third party financial institution with a long-term credit rating of at least A from at least two internationally recognized credit-rating agencies and providing for redetermination of closure costs at least once every 3 years and corresponding adjustments in the amount of the letter of credit, in amount reasonably acceptable by the minister of finance and the minister.\nThe company must hold public hearings on the SIA and the SAP at least in Monrovia, in the country seat of each proposed production area or railroad, port, power plant or road is located or to be located. The feasibility report will include a statement of the means taken to publicize the hearings, an indication of the number of persons who attended, and if known of the names of the organizations they represent, a summary of the issues raised and a discussion of the actions taken by the company in response to the hearings. The ministry may impose by regulation additional standards consistent with accepted practice in OECD counties for the location, notification, and conduct of the hearings, and may establish generally applicable requirements for third party review of the SIA and the SAP comparable to the technical review of the development plan and operations plan undertaken by the feasibility consultant.--5.7, 5.8, 13.1, 13.2,  13.5, 13.6",

The company must have the approval of the Minister to make material changes to and amend the plans, and if applicable, the report and related plans, reports and studies.\nThe company must cause all mines, mining plant, infrastructure and equipment constructed, renovated or acquired to be maintained throughout the term in a safe and sound condition in accordance with International mining standards and the requirements of insurers.\n\nThe company must provide in its feasibility report for the installation of one or more power plants to meet its reasonable needs for conducting operations in Liberia and to construct necessary infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Minister. It may not be approved unless sized to utilize optimally the hydropower resources involved, as determined by the Minister after consultation with internationally recognized hydropower consultants. Such a power plant will be designed to generate electric energy in excess to supply third party users within a 10 km radius, 24/7 in accordance with demand, within a margin of 10% of the energy required for operations. The company may charge third parties at market price but will provide electric power free of charge to Government agencies within the radius. The Government will take charge of the interconnection and distribution. The power plant must be designed and constructed to be expandable on a commercially feasible basis to have twice the generating capacity needed for operations.\n\nThe company will build a 2-lane asphalt-paved all-weather road from Tubmanburg to Mano River (Kongo) for general public use with capacity for heavy traffic. The company must begin preliminary work on the road within 2 years of the effective date; the Ministry will have developed by then the standards for the design, construction and paving. Construction must begin within a year of the Government's approval of the feasibility study. An internationally recognized engineering consulting firm must certify the road is complete and conforms with agreed standards.\nThe development plan must provide for the construction by the company (or another entity agreed upon by the parties) of a railroad from the mines to the portion of the port designated and marked on Exhibit 10A, with the capacity to move from the mines to the port on a continuing basis the maximum sustained output of products contemplated by the feasibility report. The railroad must be expandable on a commercially feasible basis to carry on a continuing basis twice as much traffic, but the company will not be obligated to build the additional capacity. The Government or any third party may elect to have the capacity expanded to meet its requirements at its own cost. The company may elect to itself carry out or contract for the additional work, to be completed within a reasonable period of time (assuming funding is timely). If it does not, the company must approve the expansion designs and work plans if they do not unreasonably interfere with operations. The Government will retain title to the fixed assets of the railroad.\nThe company will be entitled, working in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) to develop new roads and/or rehabilitate existing roads from its mining sites to the port (see Exhibit 10B) as reasonably required, after conducting a short-form feasibility study, and in conformity with the applicable laws. The company will be responsible, at the direction of MOPW, for performing and paying for repair of any damages and abnormal wear to roads and other infrastructure caused by its use of public roads to transport ore. The government will retain title to any such roads constructed by the company.\n\nThe Development plan must provide for the rehabilitation of the port by the company, and, if the parties agree and the feasibility report concludes that the Freeport of Monrovia, even after expansion, cannot support the exporting volume anticipated for the operations, for the construction by the company (or another entity agreed upon by the parties) of a new port or jetty and related logistic areas at a reasonable distance from the mining sites.--6.1(a), 6.3(c), 6.6, 6.7 (a) to (c) and (I), 19.3",

If either appointment fails within 45 business days (or the third, within 20 business days) of being called for, either party may apply to the LCIA court to appoint the missing arbitrator. The arbitration will be seated in London, England and conducted in English. The parties agree to submit irrevocably to the jurisdiction of the English courts for enforcing this agreement to arbitrate.\nIf the parties agree to the resolution by a single arbitrator, they will promptly appoint such an arbitrator by agreement. In the absence of agreement, the LCIA court will appoint the arbitrator. The arbitration decision will be final and binding unless appealed by any party to a full panel of arbitrators, who must examine it as to manifest error of law, findings of fact unsupported by any credible evidence, and abuse of authority, misconduct, or other unauthorized act by the arbitrator.\nNo concurrent arbitration proceedings will be permitted and all matters related to a dispute will be decided in a single proceeding.\nAny arbitration decision will be public, and any monetary award to be assessed and payable in dollars.
