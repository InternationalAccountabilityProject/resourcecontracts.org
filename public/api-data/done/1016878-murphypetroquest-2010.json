The Fund can be established at any time during the final 10 years of operations for a particular area. Once established, Murphy must make regular contributions to the Fund based on an estimation of decommissioning and restoration costs. If the Government takes over production operations from Murphy, then the Fund must be paid to the Government (who must then be considered liable for future decommissioning of the site). If the Fund is not sufficient to cover all decommissioning costs, Murphy must pay the additional costs. If the Fund exceeds what is needed, then the surplus must be transferred to the Government. All contributions to the Fund will be considered petroleum costs and are therefore recoverable under Art. 25 (re cost oil and gas).--Arts. 38.1, 38.2, 38.4, 38.5, 38.6",
