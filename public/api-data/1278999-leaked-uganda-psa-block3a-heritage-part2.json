The impact studies must also include measures and methods for minimising environmental damage and restoring the contract area (to be determined in consultation with the Minister of Energy and Mineral Development under Art. 25.7); The Minister will decide the timing of the impact studies; The studies must be updated and submitted to the Minister with each application for a subsequent production licence, with each application for a renewal of the exploration licence, and not less than 3 months prior to the termination of the exploration licence; The studies must contain proposed guidelines to avoid damage to the environment. Suggested guidelines are listed in Art. 25.11; In addition to the impact studies, the Licensee must include in each Work Programme and Budget (submitted under Art. 6) an environmental impact statement relating both to the work that will be undertaken under the Work Programme and the work previously undertaken under the preceding Work Programme. The Licensee must also report to the Advisory Committee how environmental matters are being addressed with respect to the environmental impact statement; The Licensee must ensure that completed environmental impact studies are made available to its employees and sublicensees so that they know of the measures and methods for environmental protection to be used in carrying out petroleum operations; Before carrying out any drilling, the Licensee must prepare and submit for review by the Minister an oil spill and fire contingency plan. Note that part of Art. 25.10 (concerning submission of impact studies to the Minister) is missing. --Arts. 25.8, 25.9, 25.10, 25.11, 25.12, 25.13(b), 25.14 ",
