In the First Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $40 Million, Kosmos must drill 1 exploration well to test the target strata of the lower cretaceous. In the Second Extension Period \u2013 Phase 1, at an estimated cost of $80 Million, Kosmos must drill 2 exploration or appraisal wells to test or appraise the target cretaceous strata.
