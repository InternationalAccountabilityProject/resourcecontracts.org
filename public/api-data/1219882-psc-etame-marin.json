The wells will be drilled to a minimum depth of 2,500m or until the Gamba geological formation is penetrated for at least 50m if it extends beyond its contractual depth. If the formation has not been encountered at 2,500m, the parties will meet to examine continuing the well.\nDrilling will be stopped at a lesser depth if the stoppage is justified because:\n- the Gamba formation is encountered before (the parties should meet to examine continuing the well)\n- basement is encountered before;\n- continuation of drilling presents an obvious hazard because of abnormal formation pressure;\n- rock formations encountered are too hard for it to be practical to continue drilling with standard equipment;\n- hydrocarbon-bearing formations are encountered that must be protected before penetration by setting casing.\nIf the drilling is stopped for any of these reasons, the well will be considered drilled to the contractual depth if the contractor timely presents its reasons to the administration and they are accepted as justified.\n\nThe contractor is required to meet its work commitments for an exploration period even if it entails exceeding the estimated amount. If the contractor meets the work commitments for a lesser amount, it is considered to have met the commitments. If all the delimited area is relinquished (cf. Article 6) or an exploration period is over and the contractor's work commitments have not been met, the contractor is required to pay to the state within 30 days of the effective date of relinquishment, a compensation equal to the cost of the exploration commitments not met or work not done at that date.\n\nThe contractor must furnish all funds necessary for the performanceof the petroleum operations defined in the annual work program, and will perform the operartions by using either its own materials, equipment and supplies or those acquired or rented to this effect, subject to the provisions of article 10.3.\nThe contractor must take all measures to ensure protection of the aquifers encountered while drilling (through proper cementing of the casing of the wells) and when abandoning uproductive wells by applying cement plugs to isolate the formations under pressure from other reservoir horizons and from the surface. It must also carry out the tests necessary to determine the value of the hydrocarbon shows encountered while drilling and the exploitability of any fields discovered.\n\nUpon obtaining an exclusive exploitation authorization, the contractor agrees to proceed with diligence to drill the necessary development wells with such intervals between wells as to guarantee maximum economy recovery for the parties, of the hydrocarbons contained in the field. Except for duly evidenced unusual circumstances, the contractor must start these development operations no later than 6 months after acceptance good practices in the hydrocarbon industry. The contractor must proceed as soon as technically feasible with enhanced recovery program studies for the field and to implement at the appropriate time this process if under acceptable economic conditions, it can lead to an improvement in the rate of recovery of the hydrocarbons of the field. The contractor is required to implement every recommendation by the administration on the subject of conservation of the fields and to comply with regulations regarding pollution and safety of persons and property.\nThe contractor must annually produce from each field quantities of hydrocarbons in accordance with generally accepted international hydrocarbon industry practices, in particular in applying the standards for conservation of the fields making optimal recovery possible in normal economic conditions.--Art.  1.3, 4, 7, 8.1 to 8.3, 21",

Each company must deliver to the person responsible for the departments in charge of hydrocarbons, no later than April 30 every year, a copy of the tax return. The tax administration, after examining the documents, will issue to each one of the companies forming the contractor the originals of the tax statements and all other documents certifying that it has met its fiscal obligations, subject to the administration's rights to audit and recovery set forth by the regulations in force.\nThe contractor will also keep a Petroleum cost account in which to enter all the recovreable expenses as they are actually incurred and the recovered amounts of the petroleum costs as this recovery takes place, as well as the receipts and proceeds of any nature to reduce or deduct form the costs, as they are collected. The account must be subdivided into subaccounts showing:\n- exploration expenses;\n- appraisal expenses;\n- development expenses;\n- exploitation expenses.\nIn order to be considered petroleum costs, the expenses must be strictly necessary for the requirement of the operations and must meet the criteria state in the accounting agreement. Expenses in connection with non-deductible costs, of a sumptuary or exaggerated nature, gratuities not authorized by the regulations, and in general all the expenses not required for proper management of the petroleum operations are not recoverable and must not be debited. At any time, the balance of the petroleum costs account must show the amount not yet recovered by the contractor. The practical methods for application of these provisions are defined in the accounting agreement 'Attachment II of the contract).\n\nThe state, in its capacity as a contracting party, and the entities forming the contractor may undertake, at their cost, through experts of their choice or their own employees, all the accounting, financial or technical examinations, verifications and audits they deem necessary or useful for their information on the management and development of the contractor's activities, on the technical methods employed an don the petroleum costs, as well as in the exercise of their right to examine, check and audit the activities and the corresponding petroleum costs within a period of 2 years after the end of the exploration periods.\nA certified copy of the reports and conclusions following these examinations, verifications and audits must obligatorily be delivered to the administration when these are conducted by the companies forming the contractor. The operator or the companies forming the contractor must inform the administration of the follow-ups. Without any examinations, verifications and audits within the required periods, no adjustment may be made later. The administration may also conduct at any time examinations, verifications and audits through experts of its choice or its own employees.\nThe contractor must deliver to the administration, not later than April 30 of each year, a detailed report on its activities of the preceding calendar year. This report will include specifically, in addition to technical data, a detailed account of the petroleum costs pertaining to that calendar year, in accordance with the accounting agreement. The files, as well as the pertinent and necessary records, accounting and technical documents and vouchers will be available to interested parties and presented at their request or requisition. The contractor will bear the related expenses incurred by the administration.\nUnder the prescription periods, the administration may request in writing all information, jusitfications and clarifications as well as any documents, reports, studies and accounting, financial, legal and technical records it deems necessary or useful for its information on the management and development of the contractor's activities and on the petroleum costs.\nIf the administration considers that the reports, files, documents and accounting records contain errors, inaccuracies, gaps or missing elements or that the contractor has made a mistake or committed an irregularity, and if it considers that corrections, adjustments, amendments or modifications should be made, the administration will notify the contractor in writing. The contractor will have 30 days from receipt to make the necessary adjustments or present its comments, to which the administration will answer in writing. For differences of a technical nature, and prior to the arbitration procedure, the parties may resort to the opinion of an expert selected through joint agreement.--Art.  19.4, 26.4 to 26.6, 29.9 +Attachment II, 48",

All the provisions of the contract will be applicable (after all necessary adjustments), including the recovery of petroleum costs, the remaining production sharing regulation, the bonuses, and the royalties and taxes. Other specific benefits may be granted. When it is necessary to determine the equivalence between natural gas and crude oil, it is agreed that 165 cubic meters of natural gas equal 1 barrel of crude oil.\nIf the contractor does not consider the natural gas discovered to be commercial, it forfeits every right to the discovery. The state is entitled to exploit the discovery on its own without paying any indemnity to the contractor.\nAny quantity of unmarketed associated gas, apart from the quantities used for the petroleum operations, will be utilized to improve the crude petroleum recovery rate through reinjection. Flaring will be limited to the bare minimum. If the government wishes to use the associated natural gas produced and not marketed or used, the parties will decide by mutual agreement on any additional technical actions necessary for shipment and use. --Art. 30",
