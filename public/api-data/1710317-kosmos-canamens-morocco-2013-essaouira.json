Of note, where hydrocarbons are discovered in the last year of the Second Extension Period, the parties may jointly apply for an exceptional period as provided by local law. In the Initial Period, the Contractor Group must conduct minimum exploration with an estimated value of $7 Million including: a reinterpretation of all existing 2D Seismic in the Area of Interest; develop cretaceous and Jurassic reservoir models and integrate with onshore geological work; evaluate Jurassic and cretaceous source rock and model thermal maturity; describe structural and depositional model for the basin; decide on the location of the 3D Seismic; acquire, process and interpret 1000 km2 3D Seismic and subsequent integration with block-wide interpretation; conduct geophysical studies including AVO analysis over key prospects; and risk and rank prospects. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the Initial Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the First Extension Period. In the First Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $30 Million, the Contractor Group must drill and evaluate results of an exploration well either with a minimum depth of 2500 meters below seabed or to the cretaceous objective, whichever is penetrated first. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the First Extension Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the Second Extension Period. In the Second Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $60 Million, the Contractor Group must drill and evaluate results of an exploration well either with a minimum depth of 2500 meters below seabed or to the cretaceous objective, whichever is penetrated first. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the Second Extension Period or subject to making payment, the Contractor Group must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration. To guarantee the Minimum Exploration Work Program, the Contractor Group must pay $2 Million bank guarantee no later than the signature of this agreement;  this bank guarantee will be reduced to $1,000,000 upon the Contractor Group providing field tapes and data in support of its 3D Seismic of 1000 km2; the bank guarantee will again be reduced by a further $500,000 upon provision of the 3D seismic data; and the final $500,000 will be returned upon the Contractor Group's provision of all reports relating to the work conducted in the Initial Period. Each time the Contractor Group enters an Extension Period, it must a $5 Million guarantee and provide a drilling contract for the committed well.
