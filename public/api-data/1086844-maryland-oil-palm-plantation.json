If an event of force majeure existed continuously for 1 year or more in respect to MOPP's right to terminate, or 4 years in respect to the Liberian government's right to terminate, and which in each case prevents production or other activities of MOPP, the party shall have the right to terminate the contract without further obligations or cost (aside from those accrued prior to the force majeure) by notice not less than 60 days prior to termination. Force majeure will mean: (i) wars or other public hostilities (also including terrorist acts, serious threats against any MOPP employee, asset, or infrastructure, (ii) trade or commercial or other restrictions imposed by any sovereign or other outside force (eg. revolutions, riots, blockades) that are continuous for 120 days or more, or other industrial, labor or employee-employer disputes that are continuous for 120 days or more, (iii) acts of God, or other destructive accidents (fires, explosions, etc.) or natural disasters, provided any such cause was not within the reasonable control of the party invoking its rights under this section and could not have been avoided or overcome by such party through the exercise of reasonable investigation or care.--Art. 23.1, 23.2, 23.3\n",

                "content":"The contract will terminate at the end of its term or terminate earlier by the mutual agreement of the parties. MOPP has the right to terminate the contract without cause one year after giving notice to the Liberian government, or if the Liberian government fails to comply with any material obligations under the contract. Any such termination shall be subject to MOPP's obligations under this contract that accrued prior to the date of termination. In case of a proposed termination based on a failure by the Liberian government to comply with any material obligation, MOPP shall provide notice to the Liberian government of its intention to terminate and if the failure is not cured within 60 days after such notice, or any longer period specified in the notice by MOPP in its reasonable discretion, then this contract will be terminated. Subject to MOPP's right to cure and the provisions of the contract, the Liberian government has the right to terminate the contract if one of the following 'events of default' occurs: (a) MOPP fails to comply with any material obligation under the contract, including constructing an oil palm processing mill by the ninth year after the date the contract comes into force; (b) MOPP voluntarily makes an assignment of most or all of its assets for the benefit of creditors, files an application to any tribunal for the appointment of a trustee or receiver for most or all of its assets, begins any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement or insolvency proceedings in any jurisdiction, or any proceedings are begun against MOPP that are not dismissed within 90 days, or if any order is entered appointing any trustee or receiver or adjudicating MOPP bankrupt or insolvent, or approving the petition in any such proceeding to permit such order to remain in effect for more than 90 days; (c) MOPP ceases minimum production for more than 1 year, unless the Liberian government consents to such cessation, or it results from force majeure, or it results from any act of prevention or material breach by the Liberian government of its obligations, (d) a condition of force majeure exists for more than 4 years. MOPP's failure to develop the concession area according to the development plan will not constitute an event of default, and the Liberian government's sole remedy will be to repossess the undeveloped land.  In the case of an event of default, the Liberian government will provide notice to MOPP of the alleged occurrence of the event and will offer MOPP a fair opportunity to consult with the Liberian government to resolve the matter. If, after a reasonable period of consultation, the Liberian government is of the opinion that the matter cannot be resolved, it may send a notice of intent to terminate the contract. If the event of default is not cured within 60 days after said notice of intent to terminate is sent (or some longer period at the Liberian government's discretion), then the contract is terminated. If the event of default is a delay in the implementation of the oil palm processing mill, the period to cure will be extended an additional 120 days provided that such a delay was not in the reasonable control of MOPP. If MOPP disputes whether or not there has been an event of default, and if MOPP refers the dispute to arbitration within 90 days of receiving the notice to terminate, then the termination will not take effect until the finality of an arbitration award upholding the Liberian government's right to terminate. Upon termination, parties will set up a winding-up commission that will consist of the Liberian Minister of Agriculture of Liberia as chairperson and 2 additional members, one appointed by each party. The chairman will issue a notice and agenda for the first meeting of the commission, which will be no later than 3 weeks after its establishment.  Thereafter, the commission will meet at least once/month.  MOPP will present to the commission a report on the status of its operations under the contract so that the commission can recommend to the Liberian government steps it might take to preserve the viability of the enterprise, employment in the area and centers of population.  At request of the Liberian government, the commission will establish plans for the cessation of operations including the disposition of assets and their demolition and/or removal.  At the request of either party, any meeting of the commission shall be held outside Liberia, and the requesting party will be responsible for travel costs.  MOPP may elect not to participate in the commission, in which event its obligations will be limited to providing the information required.  The termination rights are in addition to, not in derogation of, any remedial rights to damages either party may have.   --Art. 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.6\n",

Arbitration will be administered by the London Court of International Arbitration ('LCIA'). Arbitration will be the parties' exclusive remedy for any breach of or dispute arising under the contract. Either party may institute arbitration proceedings by giving notice to the other party and to the LCIA registrar, including a statement of the issues in dispute. Parties will not initiate arbitration unless it has (a) issued a letter to the other party noting that it is considering taking a dispute to arbitration, and (b) the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 120 days after the date of such letter. There will be 3 arbitrators. The seat of arbitration will be London, and proceedings will be conducted in English. MOPP will be considered a foreign investor and an Ivoirian national for the purposes of any court proceedings or arbitration. Parties agree to submit irrevocably to the jurisdiction of the English courts for the purpose of enforcing this contract to arbitrate. Each party is to appoint 1 arbitrator and the 2 arbitrators so appointed are then to appointed a third within 20 business days after the appointment of the second, then either party may apply to LCIA to appoint the remaining arbitrator. Decisions of arbitrators will be made public. Monetary awards will be in US Dollars. Arbitrators may not award specific performance against the Liberian government. Neither party will have liability for consequential damages (except for loss of profits from operation of the concession area or for the purposes of set-off) or exemplary or punitive damages unless provided for herein. Costs and fees incurred or imposed by LCIA will be assessed between the parties as decided by the tribunal. The Liberian government waives sovereign immunity in relation to any dispute related to the contract. The right to refer a claim to arbitration will not be affected by the fact that a party has received partial compensation from another for a loss that is the object of the claim, and such other person may participate in such proceedings by right of subrogation. Consent to arbitration before the LCIA will bind any successors-in-interest or successors to each party of the contract. Should LCIA be replaced by another similar international body, the parties will have the right to submit disputes to that party. Should the LCIA cease to exist without replacement, either party may submit disputes arising out of the contract to such other international center for arbitration as the parties agree upon.  MOPP may continue its operations during the pendency of any decision of a referee or arbitral tribunal under this section. A shareholder of MOPP (the single person which has direct control of MOPP) is entitled to be a party and to make claims in its own name in any arbitration under this contract. Any award to such shareholder will be limited by the amount that MOPP could claim for breach of the contract.  MOPP appoints such shareholder to act on its behalf with respect to all matters pursuant to the resolution of the dispute. The shareholder may transfer control of MOPP, in which case the new shareholder will enter into a deed of adherence to this contract, and MOPP and the Liberian government acknowledge that the new shareholder's entry into such deed will constitute a written arbitration contract between the new shareholder, MOPP and the Liberian government.--Art. 26\n",
