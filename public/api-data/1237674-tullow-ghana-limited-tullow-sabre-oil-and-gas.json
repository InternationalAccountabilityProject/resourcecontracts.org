                "content":"The Government is entitled to a portion of Tullow, Sabre and Kosmos' share of crude oil (\"additional oil entitlement\" or \"AOE\") on the basis of the after-tax inflation-adjusted rate of return (\u201cRoR\u201d) that the Contractor has achieved with respect to the relevant development and production area. The Government can  choose to receive the AOE in cash or in crude oil. If the AOE is taken in cash, the Contractor will pay the value equivalent to the Government's share of crude oil at the adjusted market price for the relevant period (determined in accordance with Art. 11.7). The AOE is a multi-tier, rate-of-return-based mechanism, which captures a share of net cash flows that exceed stipulated thresholds. Net cash flow for the AOE for any quarter is calculated as total revenues received after payment of royalties, less income taxes and allowable costs for the relevant quarter (excluding interest payments). For each tier of the AOE formula, the Government collects a share of the cumulative positive net cash flow, with any resulting payments then subtracted for the purposes of net cash flow calculation in the next tier of AOE. This share is collected only once the threshold rate of return of each tier is reached. The threshold for the first tier is 19%, for the second tier is 20%, for the third tier is 25%, for the fourth tier is 30% and for the fifth is 40%. The Government's AOE for the First Account (i.e. first tier) is 5% of the positive net cash flow, for the Second Account (i.e. second tier) is 10%, for the Third Account (i.e. third tier) is 15%, for the Fourth Account (i.e. fourth tier) is 20%, and for the Fifth Account (i.e. fifth tier) is 25%. No AOE is collected below a threshold rate of return of 19%.--Arts. 10.1(b), 10.2, Annex 3 \n",
