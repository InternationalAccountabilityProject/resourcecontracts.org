Of note, where hydrocarbons are discovered in the last year of the Second Extension Period, the parties may jointly apply for an exceptional period as provided by local law. In the Initial Priod, Kosmos must conduct minimum exploration valued a minimum of $4 Million including: a 1200 km2 3D Siemic survey, interpretation and integration with block wide interpretation; conduct geophysical studies including AVO analysis over key prospects; and risk and rank prospects. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the Initial Period or subject to making payment, Kosmos must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the First Extension Period. In the First Extension Period, at an estimated cost of $30 Million, Kosmos must drill and evaluate results of an exploration well either with a minimum depth of 2750 meters below seabed or to the cretaceous objective, whichever is penetratated first. Either after completing its Minimum Work Obligation in the First Extension Period or subject to making payment, Kosmos must notify ONHYM whether it plans to abandon exploration or if it plans to enter the Second Extension Period.

To guarantee the Minimum Exploration Work Program, Kosmos must pay $2 Million bank guarantee no later than the signature of this agreement;  this bank guarantee will be reduced to $500,000 upon Kosmos providing field tapes and data in support of its 3D Siesmic of 1200 km2; the bank guarantee will again be reduced by a further $250,000 upon provision of the 3D seismic data; and the final $250,000 will be returned upon Kosmos' provision of all reports relating to the work conducted in the Initial Period. Each time Kosmos enters an Extension Period, it must a $5 Million guarantee and provide a drilling contract for the committed well. Failure to provide a drilling contract increases the Kosmos' bank guarantee to $12 Million. --Art. 3.3, art. 3.4., art. 4",
