The value of Petroleum referred to in Articles 9 and 11 shall, to the extent such    <br /><br /><br />
Petroleum consists of Crude Oil, be determined at the end of each calendar month     <br /><br /><br />
commencing with the calendar month in which Commercial Production of Crude           <br /><br /><br />
Oil begins. To the extent such Petroleum consists of Natural Gas it shall be         <br /><br /><br />
determined at the end of each calendar month commencing with the calendar            <br /><br /><br />
month in which commercial delivery at the Delivery Point begins.                     <br /><br /><br />
A value for each separate export grade of Crude Oil will be:                         <br /><br /><br />

being the prices FOB within the meaning defined in Incoterms 2000, at                <br /><br /><br />
which such Crude Oil has been sold by the Concessionaire during that                 <br /><br /><br />

(b)    If the Concessionaire sells the Crude Oil to a third party on terms different <br /><br /><br />
from FOB (as per Incoterms 2000), then for the purpose of this EPC, a                <br /><br /><br />
calculated net-back FOB price shall be applied. The net-back FOB price               <br /><br /><br />
shall be established by deducting from the price agreed the actual and direct        <br /><br /><br />
costs incurred by the Concessionaire in fulfilling the obligations under their       <br /><br /><br />
sales contract additional to those obligations included under a FOB contract.        <br /><br /><br />

factors together:                                                                    <br /><br /><br />

question for the period in question. The weighted average will be                    <br /><br /><br />
based on the days in each calendar month when a closing price is                     <br /><br /><br />

question to be determined by reference to the quality of the Crude Oil             <br /><br /><br />

 under Article 10.2 (c), in order to determine the premium or discount referred to <br /><br /><br />
therein the following procedures shall be undertaken:                              <br /><br /><br />

a)    The estimates of: (i) the recoverable reserves and the projected production schedule     <br /><br /><br />
and (ii) total decommissioning costs for the Concessionaire proposed                           <br /><br /><br />
decommissioning solution as well as reasonable alternative decommissioning                     <br /><br /><br />
solutions shall be submitted for MIREM approval. The M1REM shall based on the                  <br /><br /><br />
proposals from the Concessionaire select a preliminary decommissioning solution                <br /><br /><br />
to form the basis for the calculation of decommissioning costs to be covered by a              <br /><br /><br />
Decommissioning Fund created for the purpose of covering such decommissioning                  <br /><br /><br />

b)    In any calendar year in which the Concessionaire did not submit to MIREM a               <br /><br /><br />
revised Decommissioning Plan or the total estimated decommissioning cost,                      <br /><br /><br />
Concessionaire shall update the value of the latest total estimated decommissioning            <br /><br /><br />
cost preliminary approved by MIREM in order to account for the escalation of such              <br /><br /><br />
approved estimated decommissioning costs in the period between the calendar year               <br /><br /><br />
in which such costs were estimated and the then current calendar year. For this                <br /><br /><br />
purpose, and for each calendar year, the applicable annual US Dollar escalation                <br /><br /><br />
index shall be based on the Producers Price Index for the Drilling of Oil and Gas              <br /><br /><br />
