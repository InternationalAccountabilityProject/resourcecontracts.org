The prospect area is characterized by moderate to rolling                      <br /><br /><br />
topography with conspicuous domal/conical promontories, flanked by             <br /><br /><br />
relatively flat terrain. Rugged topography with sharp ridges is noted          <br /><br /><br />
in the prospect area.                                                          <br /><br /><br />

The prospect area is bounded by the Panique River in the                     <br /><br /><br />
northernmost portion and by the Lanang River at the central portion          <br /><br /><br />
of the exploration area. Both rivers drained westward and towards            <br /><br /><br />
the Port Barrera Cove.                                                       <br /><br /><br />
4.4    Vegetation -                                                          <br /><br /><br />
The area lias limited forest trees. Cogon grass flourish and                 <br /><br /><br />
coconut trees abound with wild ipil-ipil trees. Wild bananas are             <br /><br /><br />
thriving best along creeks.                                                  <br /><br /><br />
The area is generally covered with cogon grass and shrubs                    <br /><br /><br />
suited for grazing. Mangroves and swampy areas are found in the              <br /><br /><br />
northwestern portion of the mining claims along the coastal areas.           <br /><br /><br />
The hills and valleys are practically barren except for corn farmlands       <br /><br /><br />
and vegetative crops, which grow in clusters.                                <br /><br /><br />

The proposed areas are classified as mineral lands. The                      <br /><br /><br />
surrounding areas are suited for grazing hence, the presence of mans         <br /><br /><br />
cattle ranches. Although an estimated 1/10 of its total land area is flat    <br /><br /><br />
and suitable for agricultural/vegetative crops, the residents prefer the     <br /><br /><br />
quick and more lucrative gold panning as their means of livelihood.          <br /><br /><br />

                      The advantages of color photography in geologic work are such       <br /><br /><br />
                      that it replaces the costly field data collection.                  <br /><br /><br />
                      It is used by geologist in a variety of applications including      <br /><br /><br />
                      mapping to delineate zones of hydrothermal alteration, trench of    <br /><br /><br />

 by human eye. This gives an entire new dimension to                 <br /><br /><br />
 photography and is a step toward having a “real" image of the       <br /><br /><br />
 terrain. Still, the procedures and tools of color photogeology and  <br /><br /><br />
 color photogrammetry are essentially the same as those              <br /><br /><br />
 mentioned for black-and-white photography.                          <br /><br /><br />
 Geologists can use color photography to delineate zones of          <br /><br /><br />
 hydrothermal alteration, trend of vein structures, trend of fault   <br /><br /><br />
 structures and wonder how much information they missed.             <br /><br /><br />
 Other information that can be identified and delineated from the    <br /><br /><br />
 color photograph are the vegetative cover, drainage and other       <br /><br /><br />
 water bodies, old mine workings/structures and residential areas.   <br /><br /><br />

                   During rainy season, run-off water in the area is high due  <br /><br /><br />
                   to frequent stormy weather and prolonged monsoon rains      <br /><br /><br />
                   aggravated by the rugged topography. Rare instances of      <br /><br /><br />
                   river swelling and flooding occur, normally at the height   <br /><br /><br />
                   of strong typhoons. The Lanang River is the main source     <br /><br /><br />
                   of both domestic and industrial water of the local          <br /><br /><br />
                   residents and the mining community all year round.          <br /><br /><br />
                   From historic record, the annual average water inflow       <br /><br /><br />
                   during the rainy season far exceeds 6,000 gpm, while dry    <br /><br /><br />
                   season average inflow is about 1,000 gpm. Excellent         <br /><br /><br />
                   climate and uninhabited watershed areas contribute to       <br /><br /><br />
                   continued water supply to the inhabitants. The prospect     <br /><br /><br />
                   areas, however, are outside the watershed.                  <br /><br /><br />

 The climate is relatively humid with annual rainfall varying                  <br /><br /><br />
 from 24 to 26 cms. The average rainfall data were obtained                    <br /><br /><br />
 from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and                              <br /><br /><br />
 Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA), Masbate                       <br /><br /><br />
 Station. Rainy season is from June to January with dry season                 <br /><br /><br />
 for the rest of the months. The area has an excellent climate                 <br /><br /><br />
 and good air circulation due to the absence of heavy vehicular                <br /><br /><br />
 traffic, high-rise buildings and other industries.                            <br /><br /><br />
 The temperature is warm during the months of February,                        <br /><br /><br />
 March, April and May. From June to January, the climate is                    <br /><br /><br />
 generally cool with coolest period during December and                        <br /><br /><br />
 January.                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
 4.4    Geological/Geomorphological Environment                                <br /><br /><br />
                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
 4.4.1 General Geology and Geomorphology                                       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
 The prospect area is of low-relief and rolling                                <br /><br /><br />
 topography which is characterized by many conspicuous                         <br /><br /><br />
 domal/conical promontories (volcanic plugs) flanked by                        <br /><br /><br />
 relatively flat terrain which are blanketed by                                <br /><br /><br />
 agglomerates lithified tuff and some volcanoclastics                          <br /><br /><br />
 about the watermost flank.                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 The principal mineral to be explored is gold,                                 <br /><br /><br />
 classified into two genetic types of ore deposits; gold-                      <br /><br /><br />
 bearing quartz vein and placer. The gold-bearing quartz                       <br /><br /><br />
 veins are localized and confined within the northeast                         <br /><br /><br />
 trending tensional joints or faults in the grandiorite                        <br /><br /><br />
 stock.                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
                    In general, the highest-grade gold ore follows the         <br /><br /><br />
                    contact of the grandiorite and ultramatic complex. The     <br /><br /><br />
                    ore minerals consist principally of native gold with some  <br /><br /><br />
                    galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Quartz is the         <br /><br /><br />
                    dominant gangue mineral. The type of rock that is          <br /><br /><br />
                    present underground (from old tunnels of Atlas             <br /><br /><br />
                    Consolidated Minina n«H    --- --- •*- /~'                 <br /><br /><br />
﻿rock. Biotite flakes impart foliation to the rock and they   <br /><br /><br />
are crinkled in such a way that the crinkles constitute      <br /><br /><br />
lineation. The principal sulfides consist of pyrite,         <br /><br /><br />
sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena. These minerals are      <br /><br /><br />
intimately associated with native gold and some silver.      <br /><br /><br />
The placer type refers to the river deposits, which          <br /><br /><br />
represents the continuous and successive depositions of      <br /><br /><br />
detrital materials derived mainly from the weathering        <br /><br /><br />
and disintegration of surrounding rock units in the area.    <br /><br /><br />
They are mostly made up of fragments of altered rocks,       <br /><br /><br />
ultramafics, intrusives and extrusives and associated        <br /><br /><br />
sedimentary rocks. These materials were transported by       <br /><br /><br />
surface waters occurring as veins or as discrete particles   <br /><br /><br />
in the country rock must have undergone the same             <br /><br /><br />
process. During the process of panning, the gold             <br /><br /><br />
particles intimately associated with fine magnetic           <br /><br /><br />
minerals and other heavy minerals are recovered.             <br /><br /><br />
The Panique and the Lanang Rivers at its central             <br /><br /><br />
and the southeastern peripheries bound the prospect          <br /><br /><br />
area, respectively. Both rivers drained westward at the      <br /><br /><br />
central section and empties at the flat marshy grounds of    <br /><br /><br />
the Port Barrera Cove.                                       <br /><br /><br />
Except for some occasional ornamental and fruit              <br /><br /><br />
trees, the area is generally covered with cogon. The         <br /><br /><br />
cultivated ground along slopes and flat areas within the     <br /><br /><br />
claims are planted with a few coconut clusters while the     <br /><br /><br />
rest are bare and are considered for cattle grazing.         <br /><br /><br />
4.4.2    Structural Setting                                  <br /><br /><br />
The locations of all of the five (5) gold mining             <br /><br /><br />
districts are along the so-called Philippine Rift zone or    <br /><br /><br />
the Philippine Mobile Belt. This tectonic belt has some      <br /><br /><br />
genetical control on the gold deposits in the country.       <br /><br /><br />
The Masbate vein system is thought to be a northwest         <br /><br /><br />
split or branch of the rift zone, which controlled the       <br /><br /><br />
mega fractures and the alignment of the volcanic plugs.      <br /><br /><br />
These splits and branches of the rift zone could have        <br /><br /><br />
potential for gold mineralization.                           <br /><br /><br />
The prospect area is transected by several                   <br /><br /><br />
northwest trending tension fractures and is apparently       <br /><br /><br />
situated on an elevated fault block reflecting the great     <br /><br /><br />
upward push by extensive and continuous volcanic             <br /><br /><br />
activity. The northwest recurrent-shear zones are            <br /><br /><br />
further complicated by the post -tension fractures. An       <br /><br /><br />
extensive exploration-drilling program must confirm          <br /><br /><br />
these.                                                       <br /><br /><br />

                    quartz vein appears to be cellular and resembles a           <br /><br /><br />

                    can throw us off because of its light and friable character  <br /><br /><br />

                    The consistently higher-grade values (above 3 g/dmt) are     <br /><br /><br />
                    usually hosted in the brecciated and re-cemented quartz      <br /><br /><br />
                    veins. The vein mass is composed of quartz and silicified    <br /><br /><br />
                    rock fragments re-cemented in quartz. The process of         <br /><br /><br />
                    silica-flooding, silification and brecciation has been       <br /><br /><br />
                    recurrent thereby enriching further the vein mass. These     <br /><br /><br />
                    brecciated veins are located at or near the intersection of  <br /><br /><br />
                    the major quartz veins (Wyoming-Doris and Breccia) and       <br /><br /><br />
                    Breccia veins itself. Although the veins are not more        <br /><br /><br />
                    than 90 meters wide, the intersection measures 150           <br /><br /><br />
                    meters across. The resulting vein structure assumes a        <br /><br /><br />
                    pipe-like shape and also happens to be the most ideal        <br /><br /><br />

 Assuming nnal definition of the gold-silver prospect on                       <br /><br /><br />
 the First Year, the Second Year exploration activities will                   <br /><br /><br />
 be devoted into a review of other potential target areas                      <br /><br /><br />
 within the applied area, however much of the activities is                    <br /><br /><br />
 more likely focused on various other pre-feasibility study                    <br /><br /><br />
 works.                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
 The Diamond or Core Drilling Method will be utilized to                       <br /><br /><br />
 drill deeper holes. Core drilling method relies heavily on                    <br /><br /><br />
 lube oil, grease, diesel fuel, bentonite-drilling muds, gels                  <br /><br /><br />
 and various mud additives as the main chemical agents                         <br /><br /><br />
 used during drilling operations.                                              <br /><br /><br />
 The Reverse Circulation or RC Drilling Method will be                         <br /><br /><br />
 utilized to drill and sample shallow holes, which will                        <br /><br /><br />
 comprise 80% of the planned drilling meterage. RC                             <br /><br /><br />
 drilling method operates on compressed air supplied by                        <br /><br /><br />
 compressor as the drilling medium. Unlike core drilling,                      <br /><br /><br />
 RC drilling operations uses lube oil, grease, diesel fuel                     <br /><br /><br />
 and drilling foams to stabilize caving holes.                                 <br /><br /><br />
 The following major equipment will be used:                                   <br /><br /><br />

MPSA 095-97-V area which is wrapping up its exploration phase          <br /><br /><br />
and undergoing the Mining Feasibility Study, together with the         <br /><br /><br />
rest of the applied areas to commence anytime during this              <br /><br /><br />
period. This will provide the necessary photo coverage for the:        <br /><br /><br />
♦    Historical recording of current infrastructure (both              <br /><br /><br />
mining and community), environment, etc., prior to                     <br /><br /><br />
further activity (can be useful in identifying actual                  <br /><br /><br />

♦    Geological photographic interpretation mapping and                <br /><br /><br />
so forth to delineate areas of potential for hosting                   <br /><br /><br />
additional resources.                                                  <br /><br /><br />
7.2    Creation of Company Environmental Management Officers who       <br /><br /><br />
will be responsible for monitoring and implementing programs           <br /><br /><br />
for regulatory compliance.                                             <br /><br /><br />
7.3    To protect any special habitat of flora and fauna in the area,  <br /><br /><br />
hunting of wildlife and rate animal/bird species shall be strictly     <br /><br /><br />
prohibited in the area. "Kaingin" and setting fire on the              <br /><br /><br />
vegetation shall be restricted.                                        <br /><br /><br />
7.4    Drainage system will be planned in a way to minimize erosion    <br /><br /><br />
and landslides. Major excavations will be    backfilled and            <br /><br /><br />
recontoured, in such a way that slopes’ failure will not occur         <br /><br /><br />
and the area will be landscaped.                                       <br /><br /><br />
7.5    Cutting of trees will be avoided as much as possible.           <br /><br /><br />
7.6    At the exploration sites, drill sumps will    be lined with     <br /><br /><br />
impervious materials to prevent the possibility of                     <br /><br /><br />
contaminating the soil. The effluents from the drill equipment         <br /><br /><br />
will be directed into a collecting sump for proper disposal.           <br /><br /><br />
7.7    All excavated materials will be contained    for subsequent     <br /><br /><br />
backfilling, re-vegetation and prevention of ARD.                      <br /><br /><br />
7.8    Drill sumps shall be cleaned of possible contaminants prior to  <br /><br /><br />
backfilling of original materials.                                     <br /><br /><br />
7.9    Vegetation that will be destroyed will be    replenished or     <br /><br /><br />
compensated by reforestation/afforestation projects. A nursery         <br /><br /><br />
is being maintained for this purpose.                                  <br /><br /><br />
7.10    The exploration activities will ensure that the ranches and    <br /><br /><br />
coconut plantations in the vicinity and the nearby coastal areas       <br /><br /><br />
will not be affected.                                                  <br /><br /><br />
