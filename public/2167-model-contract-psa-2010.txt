process within a reasonable period as may be required under the circumstances, the decision of the<br /><br />
Management Committee shall be approved by the majority Participating Interest of seventy percent (70%)<br /><br />
or more with Government representative having a positive vote in favour of the decision.<br /><br />
6.14 There shall be a quorum of the Management Committee for holding a meeting and making decisions with<br /><br />
each Party to the Contract represented by at least one of its nominated members in the Management<br /><br />
Committee either present in person or represented as per Article 6.10. If there is no quorum in a meeting,<br /><br />
the meeting shall stand postponed to the same day and time in the next week and if quorum is not present<br /><br />
or represented even in the next meeting and subject to a Government member being present, the members<br /><br />
present and represented will constitute the quorum and take decisions and decisions taken by such quorum<br /><br />
shall be final and binding to all the absenting Parties or Parties not represented, notwithstanding the<br /><br />
provisions of Article 6.13.<br /><br />
6.15 The Management Committee, if it considers necessary, may appoint legal, financial or technical<br /><br />
subcommittees comprised of such representatives as may be agreed by the Management Committee to<br /><br />
consider any matter requiring approval or decision of the Management Committee. Such sub-committee<br /><br />
expenses shall form part of Contract Cost with relevant cost classification as decided by the Management<br /><br />
Committee pursuant to the Section 2 of the Accounting Procedure and will be cost recoverable.<br /><br />
6.16 In the event a Party to the Contract is not entitled to vote in the Operating Committee meetings being in<br /><br />
default under the Operating Agreement, and Operator notifies Chairman of the default by the Party, then<br /><br />
the issue of exercising voting right by such defaulting Party in the Management Committee meetings shall<br /><br />
be discussed by the Management Committee. The Management Committee excluding the defaulting Party,<br /><br />
after duly hearing the views of the defaulting Party on the matter of their default under Operating Agreement,<br /><br />
shall take unanimous decision on exclusion or otherwise of the defaulting Party from voting in the<br /><br />
Management Committee meetings. For avoidance of any doubt, it is clearly understood that unanimous<br /><br />
decision by the Management Committee referred to in this Article 6.16 excludes defaulting Party from<br /><br />
such decision. Accordingly, if the Management Committee decides to exclude the defaulting Party from<br /><br />
voting in the Management Committee, then the said Party shall not be entitled to vote in the meetings of<br /><br />
the Management Committee under Contract. In that event, for the purpose of the provisions of Article<br /><br />
6.13, decisions of the Management Committee shall be made by vote of the members of the Management<br /><br />
Committee excluding the member appointed by the said Party in default and any vote or purported vote by<br /><br />
such member in the Management Committee shall be ignored. The said Party in default shall be bound by<br /><br />
all decisions of the Management Committee. The non-defaulting Parties under the Operating Agreement<br /><br />
shall indemnify Government against any claims of whatsoever nature which may arise due to exclusion of<br /><br />
defaulting Party from voting in the Management Committee.<br /><br />

PRODUCTION SHARING OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.1 The Parties to this Contract shall share in the Profit Petroleum in each Year in accordance with the provisions<br /><br />
of this Article. A Party’s share of Profit Petroleum in any Year, shall be calculated on the basis of the<br /><br />
Investment Multiple actually achieved by the Contractor at the end of the preceding Year for the Contract<br /><br />
Area as provided in Appendix-D.<br /><br />
16.2.1 When the Investment Multiple of the Contractor at the end of any Year is less than or equal to one and one<br /><br />
half (1.500), the Government shall be entitled to take and receive ___ percent (__%) and the Contractor<br /><br />
shall be entitled to take and receive ____ percent (__%) of the total Profit Petroleum from the Contract<br /><br />
Area with effect from the start of the succeeding Year.<br /><br />
16.2.2 When the Investment Multiple of the Contractor at the end of any Year is equal to or more than three and<br /><br />
one half (3.500), the Government shall be entitled to take and receive __ percent (__%) and the Contractor<br /><br />
shall be entitled to take and receive ____ percent (___%) of the total Profit Petroleum from the Contract<br /><br />
Area with effect from the start of the succeeding Year.<br /><br />
16.2.3 When the Investment Multiple of the Contractor at the end of any Year is more than one and one half<br /><br />
(1.500) but is less than three and one half (3.500), the Government shall be entitled to take and receive<br /><br />
Z%, and the Contractor shall be entitled to take and receive (100-Z) % of the total Profit Petroleum from<br /><br />
the Contract Area with effect from the start of the succeeding Year. The Government share Z% shall be<br /><br />
calculated by interpolation as under:<br /><br />
Z = a + [(b – a) * (X – 1.5)/2]<br /><br />
Where<br /><br />
‘a’ denotes Government share under Article 16.2.1;<br /><br />
‘b’ denotes Government share under Article 16.2.2;<br /><br />
‘b’ should always be higher than ‘a’;<br /><br />
‘X’ denotes Investment Multiple of Contractor at the end of preceding Year, rounded off to three decimal<br /><br />
places.<br /><br />
Note : These figures shall be as per the bid of the contractor and accepted by the Government<br /><br />
16.3 Any balance left to the credit of the Parties in any Site Restoration account, opened pursuant to the<br /><br />
provision of Article 14.10, after Site Restoration has been carried out by the Contractor in accordance<br /><br />

notice to the Contractor not later than thirtieth (30th) June in the preceding Year in which the entitlement<br /><br />
is due. Once the Government has exercised its option, the same shall continue unless the Government<br /><br />
informs the Contractor otherwise.<br /><br />
16.4.3 Where the Government has informed the Contractor of its intention to take its share in kind, the Parties<br /><br />
shall mutually agree on a procedure for delivery of the Government’s share of Profit Petroleum and,<br /><br />
where relevant, the composition of the Petroleum which is to be delivered.<br /><br />
16.5 The value of the Contractor’s Investment Multiple at the end of any Year in respect of the Contract Area<br /><br />
shall be calculated in the manner provided for, and on the basis of the net income specified in AppendixD to this Contract. However, the amount of Profit Petroleum to be shared between the Government and<br /><br />
the Contractor shall be determined for each Quarter on an accumulative basis. Pending finalisation of<br /><br />
accounts, Profit Petroleum shall be shared between the Government and the Contractor on the basis of<br /><br />
provisional estimated figures of Contract Costs, production, prices, income and any other income or<br /><br />
allowable deductions and on the basis of the value of the Investment Multiple achieved at the end of the<br /><br />
preceding Year. All such provisional estimates shall be approved by the Management Committee. When it<br /><br />
is necessary to convert monetary units into physical units of production equivalents or vice versa, the<br /><br />
price or prices determined pursuant to Articles 19 and 21 for Crude Oil, Condensate and Natural Gas<br /><br />
respectively shall be used. Within ninety (90) days of the end of each Year, a final calculation of Profit<br /><br />
Petroleum based on actual costs, quantities, prices and income for the entire Year shall be completed and<br /><br />
any necessary adjustments to the sharing of Petroleum shall be agreed upon between the Government and<br /><br />
the Contractor within thirty (30) days and made within thirty (30) days thereafter.<br /><br />

DOMESTIC SUPPLY, SALE, DISPOSAL AND<br /><br />
EXPORT OF CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.1 Until such time as the total availability of Crude Oil and Condensate from all Petroleum production<br /><br />
activities in India meets the total national demand as determined by the Government, each Company<br /><br />
comprising the Contractor, shall sell in the domestic market in India all of the Company’s entitlement to<br /><br />
Crude Oil and Condensate from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
18.2 If India attains self-sufficiency in crude oil and condensate, during any year, the Government shall advise<br /><br />
the company (ies) accordingly by a written notice. In such an event, domestic sale obligation shall be<br /><br />
suspended for such period as may be specified by the Government, and the Company shall have the right<br /><br />
to lift and export its Participating Interest share of Crude Oil and Condensate during the said period,<br /><br />
subject to any other extant policy guidelines of the Government applicable from time to time.<br /><br />
18.3 If Self-sufficiency ceases to exist, the position shall revert to domestic sale obligation as outlined in<br /><br />
Article 18.1.<br /><br />
18.4 No later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of production in a Field, and thereafter no less<br /><br />
than sixty (60) days before the commencement of each Year, the Contractor shall cause to be prepared and<br /><br />
submitted to the Parties a production forecast setting out the total quantity of Crude Oil that it estimates<br /><br />
can be produced from a Field during the succeeding Year, based on a maximum efficient rate of recovery<br /><br />
of Crude Oil from that Field in accordance with modern oilfield and petroleum industry practices. No<br /><br />
later than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of each Quarter, the Contractor shall inform its<br /><br />
estimate of production for the succeeding Quarter and shall endeavour to produce the forecast quantity for<br /><br />
each Quarter.<br /><br />
18.5 Each Company comprising the Contractor shall, throughout the term of this Contract, have the right to<br /><br />
separately take in kind and dispose of all its share of Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum and shall have<br /><br />
the obligation to lift the said Petroleum on a current basis and in such quantities so as not to cause a<br /><br />
restriction of production or inconvenience to the other Company (ies).<br /><br />
18.6 The Government shall, throughout the term of this Contract, have the right to separately take in kind and<br /><br />
dispose of its share of Crude Oil and shall have the obligation to lift the said Oil on a current basis and in<br /><br />
such quantities so as not to cause a restriction of production or inconvenience to the Contractor.<br /><br />
18.7 For the purpose of implementing the provisions of this Article, a Crude lifting procedure and Crude sales<br /><br />
agreement based on generally acceptable international terms shall be agreed upon by the Contractor with<br /><br />
buyer(s) no later than six (6) months or such shorter period as may be mutually agreed between the<br /><br />
Contractor and buyer(s) with the prior written consent of Government prior to the commencement of<br /><br />
production in a Field. Such lifting procedure shall be made available to all the Parties to this Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
ARTICLE - 19<br /><br />
VALUATION OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
19.1 For the purpose of this Contract, the value of Crude Oil, Condensate and Natural Gas (refer Article 21)<br /><br />
shall be based on the price determined as provided herein.<br /><br />
19.2 A price for Crude Oil shall be determined for each Month or such other period as the Parties may agree<br /><br />
(hereinafter referred to as “the Delivery Period”) in terms of United States Dollars per Barrel, on import<br /><br />
parity basis (with marine freight being determined on the basis of nearest port to the Contract Area) for<br /><br />
Crude Oil produced and sold or otherwise disposed of from Contract Area, for each Delivery Period, in<br /><br />
accordance with the appropriate basis for that type of sale or disposal specified below. Subject to the<br /><br />
provisions of this Article 19, it is clearly understood that the actual prices invoiced by the Company(ies)<br /><br />
for the sales will form the basis for the purposes of cost recovery, Profit Petroleum sharing and payment<br /><br />
of royalty as provided in the Articles 15, 16 and 17 respectively. The basis of valuation given in this<br /><br />
Article for the purpose of Article 15, 16 and 17 shall apply only where Government is of the view that sale<br /><br />
prices realised by the Company(ies) are not consistent with the price realisable at Arms Length Sales.<br /><br />
19.3 In the event that some or all of a Company’s or Contractor’s total sales of Crude Oil during a Delivery<br /><br />
Period are made to third parties at Arms Length Sales, all sales so made shall be valued at the weighted<br /><br />
average of the prices actually invoiced by a Company calculated by dividing the total invoice value from<br /><br />
all such sales at the Delivery Point by the total number of Barrels of the Crude Oil sold in such sales.<br /><br />
19.3.1 Each Company constituting the Contractor shall separately submit to the designated nominee of the<br /><br />
Government, within fifteen (15) days of the end of each Delivery Period, a report containing the actual<br /><br />
prices invoiced in their respective Arms Length Sales for any Crude Oil. Such reports shall distinguish<br /><br />
between term sales and spot sales and itemize volumes, customers, prices received and credit terms,<br /><br />
and a Company shall allow the designated nominee(s) of the Government to examine the relevant sales<br /><br />
contracts.<br /><br />
19.4 For the purpose of determining price at Arms Length Sales, the price of the Crude Oil at which sale takes<br /><br />
place will generally be based on per Barrel of one or more crude oils which, at the time of calculation, are<br /><br />
being freely and actively traded in the international market and are similar in characteristics and quality to<br /><br />
the Crude Oil in respect of which the price is being determined, selling price to be ascertained from Platt’s<br /><br />
Crude Oil Market Wire daily publication (“Platt’s”), or the spot market for the same crude oils ascertained<br /><br />
in the same manner, whichever price more truly reflects the current value of such crude oils. For any<br /><br />
Delivery Period in which sales take place, the price shall be the arithmetic average price per Barrel<br /><br />
determined by calculating the average for such Delivery Period of the mean of the high and low FOB<br /><br />
prices for each day of the crude oils selected for comparison adjusted for differences in the Crude Oil and<br /><br />
the crude oils being compared for quality, transportation costs, delivery time, quantity, payment terms and<br /><br />
other contract terms to the extent known and other relevant factors. In the event that Platt’s ceases to be<br /><br />
published or is not published for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days, the Parties shall agree on an<br /><br />
alternative daily publication. The Contractor shall make available all the data pertaining to pricing of<br /><br />
Crude to enable Government to decide that the proposed sale price by the Contractor/each constituents of<br /><br />
the Contractor reflects a fair market price for the Crude.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
47<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.4.1 In the event that, at the relevant time, no crude oils of similar quality to the Crude Oil to be sold are being<br /><br />
actively traded in the international markets where prices can be ascertained by international publication,<br /><br />
or the official FOB selling prices and the international spot market price vary widely between producers,<br /><br />
the Parties shall meet in good faith to determine an appropriate pricing basis.<br /><br />
19.5 The Contractor shall determine the relevant prices in accordance with this Article and the calculation,<br /><br />
basis of calculation and the price determined shall be supplied to the Government and shall be subject to<br /><br />
agreement by the Government.<br /><br />
19.6 In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement on any matter concerning selection of the crude oils for<br /><br />
comparison, the calculation, the basis of, or mechanism for the calculation of the prices, the prices arrived<br /><br />
at, the adjustment of any price or generally about the manner in which the prices are determined according<br /><br />
to the provisions of this Article within thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed<br /><br />
between the Parties, from the date of commencement of Commercial Production or the end of each Delivery<br /><br />
Period thereafter, any Party may refer the matter or matters in issue for final determination by a sole<br /><br />
expert or arbitrator appointed as provided in Article 33.<br /><br />
19.6.1 If the matter is referred to the sole expert, within ten (10) days of the said appointment, the Parties shall<br /><br />
provide the expert with all information they deem necessary or as the expert may reasonably require.<br /><br />
19.6.2 Within fifteen (15) days from the date of his appointment, the expert shall report to the Parties on the<br /><br />
issue(s) referred to him for determination, applying the criteria or mechanism set forth herein and indicate<br /><br />
his decision thereon to be applicable for the relevant Delivery Period for Crude Oil and such decision<br /><br />
shall be accepted as final and binding by the Parties.<br /><br />
19.6.3 Any price or pricing mechanism agreed by the Parties pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall not<br /><br />
be changed retroactively.<br /><br />
19.7 In the event that all sales of Crude Oil in a Delivery Period by a Company constituting the Contractor are<br /><br />
to be made to an Affiliate, the Parties may agree on an alternative method of valuing the Crude Oil for the<br /><br />
purposes of this Contract, provided that such alternative method results in an internationally competitive<br /><br />
fair market valuation for that Delivery Period. In case of disagreement, the decision of the Government on<br /><br />
determining a Crude price in case of sales to an Affiliate shall be final and binding.<br /><br />
19.8 In the event that in any Delivery Period there is more than one type of sales referred to in Articles 19.3 and<br /><br />
19.7, then, for the purpose of calculating Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum entitlement and royalty<br /><br />
payments pursuant to Articles 15, 16 and 17 respectively, a single price per Barrel of Crude Oil for all the<br /><br />
sales for the relevant Delivery Period shall be used. Such single price shall be the weighted average of the<br /><br />
prices determined for each type of sale, weighted by the respective volumes of Crude Oil sold in each type<br /><br />
of sale in the relevant Delivery Period.<br /><br />
19.9 The provisions specified above for the determination of the price of sales of Crude Oil shall apply mutatis<br /><br />
mutandis to Condensates.<br /><br />
19.10 The price of Natural Gas shall be determined as provided in Article 21.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

ARTICLE - 21<br /><br />
NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1 Until such time as the total availability of Natural Gas from all Petroleum production activities in India<br /><br />
meets the total national demand as determined by the Government, each Company comprising the<br /><br />
Contractor, shall sell in the domestic market in India all of the Company’s entitlement to Natural Gas from<br /><br />
the Contract Area.<br /><br />
21.1.1 If India attains self-sufficiency in Natural Gas, during any year, the Government shall advise the company<br /><br />
(ies) accordingly by a written notice. In such an event, domestic sale obligation shall be suspended for<br /><br />
such period as may be specified by the Government, and the Company shall have the right to lift and<br /><br />
export its Participating Interest share of Natural Gas during the said period, subject to any other extant<br /><br />
policy guidelines of the Government applicable from time to time.<br /><br />
21.1.2 If self-sufficiency ceases to exist, the position shall revert to domestic sale obligation as outlined in<br /><br />
Article 21.1.<br /><br />
21.2 The Contractor shall have the right to use Natural Gas produced from the Contract Area for the purpose of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations including reinjection for pressure maintenance in Oil Fields, gas lifting and captive<br /><br />
power generation required for Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
21.3 For the purpose of domestic sale obligation, the Contractor shall have freedom to market the Natural Gas<br /><br />
and sell its entitlement as per Government Policy for utilization of gas among different sectors.<br /><br />
21.3.1 For purposes of Article 21, the Government may from time to time frame policy for utilization of gas<br /><br />
among different sectors, both for Associated Natural Gas (ANG) as well as Non-Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
(NANG) which would cover issues relating to gas supplies to different consumer sectors.<br /><br />
21.4 Associated Natural Gas (ANG)<br /><br />
21.4.1 In the event that a Discovery of Crude Oil contains ANG, the Contractor shall declare in the proposal for<br /><br />
the declaration of the said Discovery as a Commercial Discovery as specified in Article 10, whether (and<br /><br />
by what amount) the estimated production of ANG is anticipated to exceed the quantities of ANG which<br /><br />
will be used in accordance with Article 21.2 (such excess being hereinafter referred to as “the Excess<br /><br />
ANG”). In such an event the Contractor shall indicate whether, on the basis of the available data and<br /><br />
information, it has reasonable grounds for believing that the Excess ANG could be commercially exploited<br /><br />
in accordance with the terms of this Contract along with the Commercial Production of the Crude Oil<br /><br />
from the Contract Area, and whether the Contractor intends to so exploit the Excess ANG.<br /><br />
21.4.2 Based on the principle of full utilisation and minimum flaring of ANG, a proposed development plan for<br /><br />
an Oil Discovery shall, to the extent practicable, include a plan for utilisation of the ANG including<br /><br />
estimated quantities to be flared, reinjected, and to be used for Petroleum Operations; and, if the Contractor<br /><br />
<br /><br />
50<br /><br />
<br /><br />
proposes to commercially exploit the Excess ANG for sale in the domestic market in accordance with<br /><br />
Government’s policy, or elsewhere, the proposed plans for such exploitation.<br /><br />
21.4.3 If the Contractor wishes to exploit the Excess ANG, subject to Article 21.1, the Contractor shall be free to<br /><br />
explore markets for the commercial exploitation of the said Excess ANG and submit its proposals for such<br /><br />
exploitation to the Government in accordance with Article 21.4.2.<br /><br />
21.4.4 Where the Contractor is of the view that the Excess ANG cannot be commercially exploited and chooses<br /><br />
not to exploit the said Excess ANG, or is unable to find a market for the Excess ANG pursuant to Article<br /><br />
21.4.3, the Government shall be entitled to take and utilise such Excess ANG free of any cost/charge.<br /><br />
21.4.5 If the Government elects to take the Excess ANG as provided in Article 21.4.4:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Contractor shall deliver such Excess ANG to the Government (or its nominee) free of any cost/<br /><br />
charge, at the downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Contractor shall, based on sound petroleum engineering practices, install such facilities as<br /><br />
would facilitate, insofar as practicable, uninterrupted delivery of such Excess ANG to the Government<br /><br />
or its nominee;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the cost of all facilities installed pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be borne by the Government<br /><br />
(or its nominee);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Government or its nominee shall bear all costs including gathering, treating, processing and<br /><br />
transporting costs beyond the downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the delivery of such Excess ANG shall be subject to procedures to be agreed between the Government<br /><br />
or its nominee and the Contractor prior to such delivery, such procedures to include matters relating<br /><br />
to timing of off-take of such Excess ANG. Parties shall endeavour that such procedures do not<br /><br />
restrict Oil production.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.4.6 The Excess ANG which is not commercially exploited by the Contractor, or taken by the Government or<br /><br />
its nominee pursuant to this Article 21, shall be returned to the subsurface structure or flared or otherwise<br /><br />
disposed off as approved by the Government in the context of the Development Plan, provided that flaring<br /><br />
will be resorted to only for small quantities and as a last resort.<br /><br />
21.4.7 As soon as practicable after the submission of the proposed development plan, the Contractor and the<br /><br />
Government or its nominee shall meet to discuss the sale and/or disposal of any ANG discovered with a<br /><br />
view to giving effect to the provisions of this Article 21 in a timely manner.<br /><br />
21.5 Non Associated Natural Gas (NANG)<br /><br />
21.5.1 In the event of a Discovery of NANG in the Contract Area, the Contractor shall promptly report such<br /><br />
Discovery to the Management Committee and the Government and the provisions of Articles 10.1 and<br /><br />
10.2 shall apply. The remaining provisions of Article 10 would apply to the Discovery and development<br /><br />
of NANG only insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article. Notwithstanding the<br /><br />
provisions of Article 3, the Contractor shall be entitled to retain the Discovery Area subject to the provisions<br /><br />
of this Article 21.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
51<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.5.2 If, pursuant to Article 10.1, the Contractor gives notification that the Discovery is of potential commercial<br /><br />
interest, the Contractor shall submit to the Management Committee, within one (1) year from the date of<br /><br />
notification of the above said Discovery, the proposed Appraisal Programme, including a Work Programme<br /><br />
and Budget to carry out an adequate and effective appraisal of such Discovery, to determine (i) without<br /><br />
delay, whether such Discovery is a Commercial Discovery and (ii) with reasonable precision, the boundaries<br /><br />
of the area to be delineated as the Development Area. Such proposed Appraisal Programme shall be<br /><br />
supported by all relevant data such as Well data, Contractor’s best estimate of reserve range and production<br /><br />
potential, and shall indicate the date of commencement of the proposed Appraisal Programme.<br /><br />
21.5.3 The proposed Appraisal Programme together with the Work Programme and Budget referred to in Article<br /><br />
21.5.2 shall be reviewed by the Management Committee within sixty (60) days of its submission by the<br /><br />
Contractor. The Management Committee shall offer its comments within the said period. The said Appraisal<br /><br />
Programme together with the Work Programme and Budget submitted by the Contractor as revised or<br /><br />
modified or amended in light of the Management Committee review and advice, shall be adopted as the<br /><br />
Appraisal Programme and the Contractor shall promptly proceed with implementation of the said<br /><br />
Programme.<br /><br />
21.5.4 If on the basis of the results of the Appraisal Programme, the Contractor is of the opinion that NANG has<br /><br />
been discovered in commercial quantities, it shall submit to the Management Committee as soon as<br /><br />
practicable but not later than three (3) years from the date of notification of the aforementioned Discovery,<br /><br />
a proposal for the declaration of the Discovery as a Commercial Discovery. Such proposal shall take into<br /><br />
account the Government’s policies on Gas utilization and propose alternative options, if any for use or<br /><br />
consumption of the NANG and be accompanied by a report on the Discovery supported by, inter alia,<br /><br />
technical and economic data, evaluations, interpretations and analyses of such data and feasibility studies<br /><br />
relating to the Discovery prepared by or on behalf of the Contractor, and other relevant information. If no<br /><br />
proposal is submitted to the Management Committee by the Contractor within three (3) years from the<br /><br />
said Discovery, the Contractor shall relinquish its rights to develop such Discovery and the area relating<br /><br />
to such Discovery shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
21.5.5 Where the Contractor has submitted a proposal for the declaration of a Discovery as a Commercial<br /><br />
Discovery, the Management Committee shall consider the proposal of the Contractor with reference to<br /><br />
commercial utilization or commercial development of the NANG in the domestic market or elsewhere<br /><br />
and in the context of Government’s policy on Gas utilization and the chain of activities required to bring<br /><br />
the NANG from the Delivery Point to potential consumers in the domestic market or elsewhere. The<br /><br />
Management Committee may, within eighty five (85) days of the submission of the said proposal, request<br /><br />
the Contractor to submit any additional information on the Discovery, the anticipated markets or any<br /><br />
other related matter that may reasonably be required to facilitate a review. The Contractor shall submit the<br /><br />
required information within thirty (30) days of the request by the Management Committee. The Management<br /><br />
Committee will advise the Contractor of its review within one hundred and thirty five (135) days from the<br /><br />
submission of proposal or within fifty five (55) days from the receipt of additional information, as the<br /><br />
case may be, on the proposal made by the Contractor to declare the Discovery as a Commercial Discovery.<br /><br />
21.5.6 If the Contractor declares the Discovery a Commercial Discovery after taking into account the advice of<br /><br />
the Management Committee as referred to in the Article 21.5.5, the Contractor shall, within one (1) year<br /><br />
of the declaration of the Discovery as a Commercial Discovery, submit a development plan for the<br /><br />
development of the Discovery to the Management Committee for approval. Such plan shall be supported<br /><br />
by all relevant information including, inter alia, the information required in Article 10.7.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
52<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.5.7 Unless otherwise agreed by the Management Committee, it shall consider the proposed development plan<br /><br />
and give their approval within one hundred and sixty five (165) days of submission thereof or eighty five<br /><br />
(85) days from the receipt of the clarifications/additional information from the Contractor. Any clarification/<br /><br />
additional information required by the Management Committee shall be asked for within eighty five (85)<br /><br />
days of receipt of the proposal from the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide such additional information<br /><br />
within thirty (30) days from the receipt of request by the Management Committee. If the Management<br /><br />
Committee fails to convey its decision within one hundred and sixty five (165) days from the submission<br /><br />
of the development plan or eighty five (85) days from the receipt of the clarifications/additional information,<br /><br />
whichever is later, the Contractor may submit the development plan for the approval of the Government.<br /><br />
Also, where, the Management Committee rejects the development plan of the Contractor, the Contractor<br /><br />
can submit the development plan for the approval of the Government.<br /><br />
21.5.8 Where the development plan is submitted to the Government for approval pursuant to Article 21.5.7,<br /><br />
the Government shall convey its decision within one hundred and fifteen (115) days from the date of<br /><br />
receipt of the proposal from the Contractor. Government, where it considers necessary, may ask<br /><br />
clarifications/additional information from the Contractor within eighty five (85) days and shall convey<br /><br />
its decision within fifty five (55) days from the date of receipt of such clarifications/additional<br /><br />
information.<br /><br />
21.5.9 If the Government has failed to approve or disapproves the Contractor’s proposed development plan,<br /><br />

escrow account to be opened with a financial institution, failing mutually agreed agreement with State<br /><br />
Bank of India within thirty (30) days from the date when the amount is disputed by the Contractor. The<br /><br />

mutually agreed to between the Parties.<br /><br />
1.9.8 If the Contractor and the Government are unable to reach final agreement on proposed audit adjustments,<br /><br />
either Party may refer any dispute thereon to a sole expert as provided for in the Contract. So long as any<br /><br />

<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Investment Multiple ratio of the Contractor as at the end of any Year shall be calculated by dividing<br /><br />
the aggregate value of the addition of each of the annual Net Incomes (accumulated, without interest, up<br /><br />
<br /><br />
105<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to and including that Year starting from the Year in which Production Costs were first incurred or Production<br /><br />
first arose) by the aggregate value of the addition of each of the annual Investments (accumulated, without<br /><br />
interest, up to and including that Year starting from the Year in which Exploration and Development Costs<br /><br />
were first incurred).<br /><br />
