under the circumstances, the decision of the Management Committee shall be approved by the majority Participating Interest<br /><br />
of seventy percent (70%) or more with Government representative having a positive vote in favour of the decision.<br /><br />
6.14 There shall be a quorum of the Management Committee for holding a meeting and making decisions with each Party to the<br /><br />
Contract represented by at least one of its nominated members in the Management Committee either present in person or<br /><br />
represented as per Article 6.10. If there is no quorum in a meeting, the meeting shall stand postponed to the same day and<br /><br />
time in the next week and if quorum is not present or represented even in the next meeting and subject to a Government<br /><br />
member being present, the members present and represented will constitute the quorum and take decisions and decisions<br /><br />
taken by such quorum shall be final and binding to all the absenting Parties or Parties not represented, notwithstanding the<br /><br />

such defaulting Party in the Management Committee meetings shall be discussed by the Management Committee. The<br /><br />
Management Committee excluding the defaulting Party, after duly hearing the views of the defaulting Party on the matter of<br /><br />
their default under Operating Agreement, shall take unanimous decision on exclusion or otherwise of the defaulting Party<br /><br />
from voting in the Management Committee meetings. For avoidance of any doubt, it is clearly understood that unanimous<br /><br />

ARTICLE_18<br /><br />
DOMESTIC SUPPLY, SALE, DISPOSAL AND<br /><br />
EXPORT OF CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE<br /><br />
18.1 Until such time as the total availability to the Government of Crude Oil and Condensate from all Petroleum production<br /><br />
activities in India meets the total national demand, each Company comprising the Contractor, shall be required to sell in the<br /><br />
domestic market in India all of the Company’s entitlement to Crude Oil and Condensate from the Contract Area in order to<br /><br />
assist in satisfying the national demand.<br /><br />
18.2 If, during any Year, India attains Self-sufficiency, the Government shall promptly thereafter, but in no event later than the end<br /><br />
of the first Quarter of the following Year, so advise the Company(ies) by written notice. In such event, as from the end of the<br /><br />
second Quarter of the following Year, or such earlier date as the Parties may mutually agree, domestic sale obligation shall<br /><br />
be suspended and the Company shall have the right to lift and export its Participating Interest share of Crude Oil and<br /><br />
Condensate until such time, if any, as Self-sufficiency shall have ceased to exist. If Self-sufficiency ceases to exist during a<br /><br />
Year, the Government shall recover its position to ask Company(ies) under Article 18.1 in respect of the following Year by<br /><br />
giving ninety (90) days notice thereof to the Company(ies) to sell Crude Oil and Condensate in the Indian domestic market.<br /><br />
18.3 Upon India achieving Self-sufficiency, the Company(ies) shall be entitled to freely lift and export any Crude Oil and<br /><br />
Condensate pursuant to this Article 18, subject to Government’s generally applicable destination restrictions to countries<br /><br />
with which the Government, for policy reasons, has severed or restricted trade.<br /><br />
18.4 No later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of production in a Field, and thereafter no less than sixty (60) days<br /><br />
before the commencement of each Year, the Contractor shall cause to be prepared and submitted to the Parties a production<br /><br />
forecast setting out the total quantity of Crude Oil that it estimates can be produced from a Field during the succeeding Year,<br /><br />
based on a maximum efficient rate of recovery of Crude Oil from that Field in accordance with modern oilfield and<br /><br />
petroleum industry practices. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of each Quarter, the Contractor shall<br /><br />
inform its estimate of production for the succeeding Quarter and shall endeavour to produce the forecast quantity for each<br /><br />
Quarter.<br /><br />
18.5 Each Company comprising the Contractor shall, throughout the term of this Contract, have the right to separately take in<br /><br />
kind and dispose of all its share of Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum and shall have the obligation to lift the said<br /><br />
57<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Petroleum on a current basis and in such quantities so as not to cause a restriction of production or inconvenience to the other<br /><br />
Company(ies).<br /><br />
18.6 The Government shall, throughout the term of this Contract, have the right to separately take in kind and dispose of its share<br /><br />
of Crude Oil and shall have the obligation to lift the said Oil on a current basis and in such quantities so as not to cause a<br /><br />
restriction of production or inconvenience to the Contractor.<br /><br />
18.7 For the purpose of implementing the provisions of this Article, a Crude lifting procedure and Crude sales agreement based on<br /><br />
generally acceptable international terms shall be agreed upon by the Contractor with buyer(s) no later than six (6) months or<br /><br />
such shorter period as may be mutually agreed between the Contractor and buyer(s) with the consent of Government prior to<br /><br />
the commencement of production in a Field. Such lifting procedure shall be made available to all the Parties to this Contract.<br /><br />
58<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 19<br /><br />
VALUATION OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
19.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of this Contract, the value of Crude Oil, Condensate and Natural Gas (refer Article 21) shall be based on<br /><br />
the price determined as provided herein.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A price for Crude Oil shall be determined for each Month or such other period as the Parties may agree (hereinafter<br /><br />
referred to as “the Delivery Period”) in terms of United States Dollars per Barrel, on import parity basis (with marine<br /><br />
freight being determined on the basis of nearest port to the Contract Area) for Crude Oil produced and sold or otherwise<br /><br />
disposed of from Contract Area, for each Delivery Period, in accordance with the appropriate basis for that type of sale or<br /><br />
disposal specified below. Subject to the provisions of this Article 19, it is clearly understood that the actual prices received<br /><br />
by the Company(ies) from the sales will form the basis for the purposes of cost recovery, Profit Petroleum sharing and<br /><br />
payment of royalty as provided in the Articles 15, 16 and 17 respectively. The basis of valuation given in this Article for<br /><br />
the purpose of Article 15,16 and 17 shall apply only where Government is of the view that sale prices realised by the<br /><br />
Company(ies) are not consistent with the price realisable at Arms Length Sales.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that some or all of a Company’s or Contractor’s total sales of Crude Oil during a Delivery Period are made to<br /><br />
third parties at Arms Length Sales, all sales so made shall be valued at the weighted average of the prices actually received<br /><br />
by a Company, calculated by dividing the total receipts from all such sales at the Delivery Point by the total number of<br /><br />
Barrels of the Crude Oil sold in such sales.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.3.1 Each Company constituting the Contractor shall separately submit to the designated nominee of the Government, within<br /><br />
fifteen (15) days of the end of each Delivery Period, a report containing the actual prices obtained in their respective Arms<br /><br />
Length Sales for any Crude Oil. Such reports shall distinguish between term sales and spot sales and itemize volumes,<br /><br />
customers, prices received and credit terms, and a Company shall allow the designated nominee(s) of the Government to<br /><br />
examine the relevant sales contracts.<br /><br />
19.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of determining price at Arms Length Sales, the price of the Crude Oil at which sale takes place will<br /><br />
generally be based on per Barrel of one or more crude oils which, at the time of calculation, are being freely and actively<br /><br />
traded in the international market and are similar in characteristics and quality to the Crude Oil in respect of which the<br /><br />
price is being determined, selling price to be ascertained from Platt’s Crude Oil Market Wire daily publication (“Platt’s”),<br /><br />
or the spot market for the same crude oils ascertained in the same manner, whichever price more truly reflects the current<br /><br />
value of such crude oils. For any Delivery<br /><br />
59<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Period in which sales take place, the price shall be the arithmetic average price per Barrel determined by calculating the<br /><br />
average for such Delivery Period of the mean of the high and low FOB prices for each day of the crude oils selected for<br /><br />
comparison adjusted for differences in the Crude Oil and the crude oils being compared for quality, transportation costs,<br /><br />
delivery time, quantity, payment terms and other contract terms to the extent known and other relevant factors. In the event<br /><br />
that Platt’s ceases to be published or is not published for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days, the Parties shall agree on<br /><br />
an alternative daily publication. The Contractor shall make available all the data pertaining to pricing of Crude to enable<br /><br />
Government to decide that the proposed sale price by the Contractor/each constituents of the Contractor reflects a fair<br /><br />
market price for the Crude.<br /><br />
19.4.1 In the event that, at the relevant time, no crude oils of similar quality to the Crude Oil to be sold are being actively traded in<br /><br />
the international markets where prices can be ascertained by international publication, or the official FOB selling prices<br /><br />
and the international spot market price vary widely between producers, the Parties shall meet in good faith to determine an<br /><br />
appropriate pricing basis.<br /><br />
19.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall determine the relevant prices in accordance with this Article and the calculation, basis of calculation<br /><br />
and the price determined shall be supplied to the Government and shall be subject to agreement by the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement on any matter concerning selection of the crude oils for comparison, the<br /><br />
calculation, the basis of, or mechanism for the calculation of the prices, the prices arrived at, the adjustment of any price or<br /><br />
generally about the manner in which the prices are determined according to the provisions of this Article within thirty<br /><br />
(30) days, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed between the Parties, from the date of commencement of<br /><br />
Commercial Production or the end of each Delivery Period thereafter, any Party may refer the matter or matters in issue for<br /><br />
final determination by a sole expert or arbitrator appointed as provided in Article 33.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.6.1 If the matter is referred to the sole expert, within ten (10) days of the said appointment, the Parties shall provide the expert<br /><br />
with all information they deem necessary or as the expert may reasonably require.<br /><br />
19.6.2 Within fifteen (15) days from the date of his appointment, the expert shall report to the Parties on the issue(s) referred to<br /><br />
him for determination, applying the criteria or mechanism set forth herein and indicate his decision thereon to be applicable<br /><br />
for the relevant Delivery Period for Crude Oil and such decision shall be accepted as final and binding by the Parties.<br /><br />
19.6.3 Any price or pricing mechanism agreed by the Parties pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall not be changed<br /><br />
retroactively.<br /><br />
19.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that all sales of Crude Oil in a Delivery Period by a Company constituting the Contractor are to be made to an<br /><br />
Affiliate, the Parties may agree<br /><br />
60<br /><br />
<br /><br />
on an alternative method of valuing the Crude Oil for the purposes of this Contract, provided that such alternative method<br /><br />
results in an internationally competitive fair market valuation for that Delivery Period. In case of disagreement, the decision<br /><br />
of the Government on determining a Crude price in case of sales to an Affiliate shall be final and binding.<br /><br />
19.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that in any Delivery Period there is more than one type of sales referred to in Articles 19.3 and 19.7, then, for<br /><br />
the purpose of calculating Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum entitlement and royalty payments pursuant to Articles 15,<br /><br />
16 and 17 respectively, a single price per Barrel of Crude Oil for all the sales for the relevant Delivery Period shall be used.<br /><br />
Such single price shall be the weighted average of the prices determined for each type of sale, weighted by the respective<br /><br />
volumes of Crude Oil sold in each type of sale in the relevant Delivery Period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions specified above for the determination of the price of sales of Crude Oil shall apply mutatis mutandis to<br /><br />
Condensates.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19.10 The price of Natural Gas shall be determined as provided in Article 21.<br /><br />
61<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 20<br /><br />

<br /><br />
ARTICLE 21<br /><br />
NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
21.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to Article 21.2, the Indian domestic market shall have the first call on the utilisation of Natural Gas discovered and<br /><br />
produced from the Contract Area. Accordingly, any proposal by the Contractor relating to Discovery and production of<br /><br />
Natural Gas from the Contract Area shall be made in the context of the Government’s policy for the utilisation of Natural<br /><br />
Gas and shall take into account the objectives of the Government to develop its resources in the most efficient manner and<br /><br />
to promote conservation measures.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall have the right to use Natural Gas produced from the Contract Area for the purpose of Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations including reinjection for pressure maintenance in Oil Fields, gas lifting and captive power generation required<br /><br />
for Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purpose of sales in the domestic market pursuant to this Article 21, the Contractor shall have freedom to market the<br /><br />
Gas and sell its entitlement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas (ANG)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.4.1 In the event that a Discovery of Crude Oil contains ANG, the Contractor shall declare in the proposal for the declaration of<br /><br />
the said Discovery as a Commercial Discovery as specified in Article 10, whether (and by what amount) the estimated<br /><br />
production of ANG is anticipated to exceed the quantities of ANG which will be used in accordance with Article 21.2<br /><br />
(such excess being hereinafter referred to as “the Excess ANG”). In such an event the Contractor shall indicate whether, on<br /><br />
the basis of the available data and information, it has reasonable grounds for believing that the Excess ANG could be<br /><br />
commercially exploited in accordance with the terms of this Contract along with the Commercial Production of the Crude<br /><br />
Oil from the Contract Area, and whether the Contractor intends to so exploit the Excess ANG.<br /><br />
21.4.2 Based on the principle of full utilisation and minimum flaring of ANG, a proposed development plan for an Oil Discovery<br /><br />
shall, to the extent practicable, include a plan for utilisation of the ANG including estimated quantities to be flared,<br /><br />
reinjected, and to be used for Petroleum Operations; and, if the Contractor proposes to commercially exploit the Excess<br /><br />
ANG for sale in the domestic market in accordance with Government’s policy, or elsewhere, the proposed plans for such<br /><br />
exploitation.<br /><br />
21.4.3 If the Contractor wishes to exploit the Excess ANG, subject to Article 21.1, the Contractor shall be free to explore markets<br /><br />
for the commercial exploitation of the<br /><br />
63<br /><br />
<br /><br />
said Excess ANG and submit its proposals for such exploitation to the Government in accordance with Article 21.4.2.<br /><br />
21.4.4 Where the Contractor is of the view that the Excess ANG cannot be commercially exploited and chooses not to exploit the<br /><br />
said Excess ANG, or is unable to find a market for the Excess ANG pursuant to Article 21.4.3, the Government shall be<br /><br />
entitled to take and utilise such Excess ANG free of any cost/charge.<br /><br />
21.4.5 If the Government elects to take the Excess ANG as provided in Article 21.4.4:<br /><br />
(a) the Contractor shall deliver such Excess ANG to the Government (or its nominee) free of any cost/charge, at the<br /><br />
downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities;<br /><br />
(b) the Contractor shall, based on sound petroleum engineering practices, install such facilities as would facilitate, insofar as<br /><br />
practicable, uninterrupted delivery of such Excess ANG to the Government or its nominee;<br /><br />
(c) the cost of all facilities installed pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall be borne by the Government (or its nominee);<br /><br />
(d) the Government or its nominee shall bear all costs including gathering, treating, processing and transporting costs<br /><br />
beyond the downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities; and<br /><br />
(e) the delivery of such Excess ANG shall be subject to procedures to be agreed between the Government or its nominee<br /><br />
and the Contractor prior to such delivery, such procedures to include matters relating to timing of off-take of such<br /><br />
Excess ANG. Parties shall endeavour that such procedures do not restrict Oil production.<br /><br />
21.4.6 The Excess ANG which is not commercially exploited by the Contractor, or taken by the Government or its nominee<br /><br />
pursuant to this Article 21, shall be returned to the subsurface structure or flared or otherwise disposed off as approved by<br /><br />
the Government in the context of the Development Plan, provided that flaring will be resorted to only for small quantities<br /><br />
and as a last resort.<br /><br />
21.4.7 As soon as practicable after the submission of the proposed development plan, the Contractor and the Government or its<br /><br />
nominee shall meet to discuss the sale and/or disposal of any ANG discovered with a view to giving effect to the<br /><br />
provisions of this Article 21 in a timely manner.<br /><br />
21.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non Associated Natural Gas (NANG)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.5.1 In the event of a Discovery of NANG in the Contract Area, the Contractor shall promptly report such Discovery to the<br /><br />
Management Committee and the Government and the provisions of Articles 10.1 and 10.2 shall apply. The remaining<br /><br />
provisions of Article 10 would apply to the Discovery and development of NANG only insofar as they are not inconsistent<br /><br />
with the<br /><br />
64<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provisions of this Article. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3, the Contractor shall be entitled to retain the<br /><br />
Discovery Area subject to the provisions of this Article 21.<br /><br />
21.5.2 If, pursuant to Article 10.1, the Contractor gives notification that the Discovery is of potential commercial interest, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall submit to the Management Committee, within one (1) year from the date of notification of the above said<br /><br />
Discovery, the proposed Appraisal Programme, including a Work Programme and Budget to carry out an adequate and<br /><br />
effective appraisal of such Discovery, to determine (i) without delay, whether such Discovery is a Commercial Discovery<br /><br />
and (ii) with reasonable precision, the boundaries of the area to be delineated as the Development Area. Such proposed<br /><br />
Appraisal Programme shall be supported by all relevant data such as Well data, Contractor’s best estimate of reserve range<br /><br />
and production potential, and shall indicate the date of commencement of the proposed Appraisal Programme.<br /><br />
21.5.3 The proposed Appraisal Programme together with the Work Programme and Budget referred to in Article 21.5.2 shall be<br /><br />
reviewed by the Management Committee within sixty (60) days of its submission by the Contractor. The Management<br /><br />
Committee shall offer its comments within the said period. The said Appraisal Programme together with the Work<br /><br />
Programme and Budget submitted by the Contractor as revised or modified or amended in light of the Management<br /><br />
Committee review and advice, shall be adopted as the Appraisal Programme and the Contractor shall promptly proceed<br /><br />
with implementation of the said Programme.<br /><br />
21.5.4 If on the basis of the results of the Appraisal Programme, the Contractor is of the opinion that NANG has been discovered<br /><br />
in commercial quantities, it shall submit to the Management Committee as soon as practicable but not later than three<br /><br />
(3) years from the date of notification of the aforementioned Discovery, a proposal for the declaration of the Discovery as a<br /><br />
Commercial Discovery. Such proposal shall take into account the Government’s policies on Gas utilization and propose<br /><br />
alternative options, if any for use or consumption of the NANG and be accompanied by a report on the Discovery<br /><br />
supported by, inter alia, technical and economic data, evaluations, interpretations and analyses of such data and feasibility<br /><br />
studies relating to the Discovery prepared by or on behalf of the Contractor, and other relevant information. If no proposal<br /><br />
is submitted to the Management Committee by the Contractor within three (3) years from the said Discovery, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall relinquish its rights to develop such Discovery and the area relating to such Discovery shall be excluded<br /><br />
from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
21.5.5 Where the Contractor has submitted a proposal for the declaration of a Discovery as a Commercial Discovery, the<br /><br />
Management Committee shall consider the proposal of the Contractor with reference to commercial utilization or<br /><br />
commercial development of the NANG in the domestic market or elsewhere and in the context of Government’s policy on<br /><br />
Gas utilization and the chain of activities required to<br /><br />
65<br /><br />
<br /><br />
bring the NANG from the Delivery Point to potential consumers in the domestic market or elsewhere. The Management<br /><br />
Committee may, within eighty five (85) days of the submission of the said proposal, request the Contractor to submit any<br /><br />
additional information on the Discovery, the anticipated markets or any other related matter, that may reasonably be<br /><br />
required to facilitate a review. The Contractor shall submit the required information within thirty (30) days of the request<br /><br />
by the Management Committee. The Management Committee will advise the Contractor of its review within one hundred<br /><br />
and thirty five (135) days from the submission of proposal or within fifty five (55) days from the receipt of additional<br /><br />
information, as the case may be, on the proposal made by the Contractor to declare the Discovery as a Commercial<br /><br />
Discovery.<br /><br />
21.5.6 If the Contractor declares the Discovery a Commercial Discovery after taking into account the advice of the Management<br /><br />
Committee as referred to in the Article 21.5.5, the Contractor shall, within one (1) year of the declaration of the Discovery<br /><br />
as a Commercial Discovery, submit a development plan for the development of the Discovery to the Management<br /><br />
Committee for approval. Such plan shall be supported by all relevant information including, inter alia, the information<br /><br />
required in Article 10.7.<br /><br />
21.5.7 Unless otherwise agreed by the Management Committee, it shall consider the proposed development plan and give their<br /><br />
approval within one hundred and sixty five (165) days of submission thereof or eighty five (85) days from the receipt of the<br /><br />
clarifications/additional information from the Contractor. Any clarification/additional information required by the<br /><br />
Management Committee shall be asked for within eighty five (85) days of receipt of the proposal from the Contractor. The<br /><br />
Contractor shall provide such additional information within thirty (30) days from the receipt of request by the Management<br /><br />
Committee. If the Management Committee fails to convey its decision within one hundred and sixty five (165) days from<br /><br />
the submission of the development plan or eighty five (85) days from the receipt of the clarifications/additional<br /><br />

specifically, the purpose of the Accounting Procedure is to:<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
classify costs and expenditures and to define which costs and expenditures shall be allowable for cost recovery and<br /><br />
profit sharing and participation purposes;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
specify the manner in which the Contractor’s accounts shall be prepared and approved; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
-<br /><br />
<br /><br />
address numerous other accounting related matters.<br /><br />
This Accounting Procedure is intended to apply to the provisions of the Contract and is without prejudice to the<br /><br />

<br /><br />
1.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />

certificate from an internationally recognized firm of public accountants acceptable to both the Government and the<br /><br />
Contractor, which may be the Contractor’s statutory auditor. Submission of the audit certificate, shall in no way relieve or<br /><br />

1.9.7 Notwithstanding any reference to a Sole Expert or Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, in case any<br /><br />
amount is claimed as due to the Government resulting from the audit exception but not accepted or settled by the Contractor,<br /><br />
then the Contractor shall deposit such claimed amount in a escrow account to be opened with a financial institution, failing<br /><br />
mutually agreed agreement with State Bank of India within thirty (30) days from the date when the amount is disputed by<br /><br />
the Contractor. The amount in escrow account shall be appropriated or adjusted in accordance with the decision or award of<br /><br />
the Sole Expert or Arbitral Tribunal as may be or otherwise as mutually agreed to between the Parties.<br /><br />
1.9.8 If the Contractor and the Government are unable to reach final agreement on proposed audit adjustments, either Party may<br /><br />
refer any dispute thereon to a sole expert as provided for in the Contract. So long as any issues are outstanding with respect<br /><br />
to an audit, the Contractor shall maintain the relevant documents and permit inspection thereof until the issue is resolved.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the Contractor’s Exploration Costs incurred on or in the Contract Area pursuant to Article 15<br /><br />
plus<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii) the Contractor’s Development Costs incurred on or in the Contract Area.<br /><br />

130<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

value of the addition of each of the annual Net Cash Incomes (accumulated, without interest, up to and including that Year<br /><br />
starting from the Year in which Production Costs were first incurred or Production first arose) by the aggregate value of the<br /><br />
addition of each of the annual Investments (accumulated, without interest, up to and including that Year starting from the<br /><br />
Year in which Exploration and Development Costs were first incurred).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.<br /><br />
