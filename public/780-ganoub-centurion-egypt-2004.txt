Commercial Oil Discovery, or thirteen (13) months after the          <br /><br /><br />
completion of a well not considered to be a "Commercial Oil          <br /><br /><br />

writing to CONTRACTOR, at its sole cost, risk and expense,           <br /><br /><br />
to develop, produce and dispose of all Crude Oil from the            <br /><br /><br />
geological feature on which the well has been drilled. Said          <br /><br /><br />
notice shall state the specific area covering said geological        <br /><br /><br />
feature to be developed, the wells to be drilled, the                <br /><br /><br />
production facilities to be installed and GANOPE's                   <br /><br /><br />
estimated cost thereof. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of     <br /><br /><br />
said notice CONTRACTOR may, in writing, elect to develop             <br /><br /><br />
such area as provided for in the case of Commercial                  <br /><br /><br />
Discovery hereunder. In such event all terms of this                 <br /><br /><br />
Agreement shall continue to apply to the specified area.             <br /><br /><br />

practice. GANOPE shall be entitled to perform or in the              <br /><br /><br />
event Operating Company has come into existence, to have             <br /><br /><br />

account of GANOPE and at GANOPE's sole cost, risk and                <br /><br /><br />
expense. When GANOPE has recovered from the Crude                    <br /><br /><br />
Oil produced from such specific area a quantity of Crude Oil         <br /><br /><br />
equal in value to three hundred percent (300%) of the cost           <br /><br /><br />
it has incurred in carrying out the sole risk operations,            <br /><br /><br />

 payment the specific area shall either (i) revert to the status   <br /><br /><br />
 of an ordinary Development Lease under this Agreement             <br /><br /><br />
 and thereafter shall be operated in accordance with the           <br /><br /><br />
 terms hereof; or (ii) alternatively, in the event that at such    <br /><br /><br />
 time GANOPE or its Affiliated Company is conducting               <br /><br /><br />
 Development operations in the area at its sole expense and        <br /><br /><br />
 GANOPE elects to continue operating, the area shall               <br /><br /><br />
 remain set aside and CONTRACTOR shall only be entitled            <br /><br /><br />
 to its production sharing percentages of the Crude Oil as         <br /><br /><br />
 specified in Article VII (b). The sole risk Crude Oil shall be    <br /><br /><br />
 valued in the manner provided in Article VII (c). In the          <br /><br /><br />
 event of any termination of this Agreement under the              <br /><br /><br />
 provisions of Article III (b), this Agreement shall, however,     <br /><br /><br />
 continue to apply to GANOPE's operations of any sole risk         <br /><br /><br />
 venture hereunder, although such Agreement shall have             <br /><br /><br />
 been terminated with respect to CONTRACTOR pursuant to            <br /><br /><br />
 the provisions of Article III (b).                                <br /><br /><br />

Agreement (i.e.t the date of rendition of the relevant Cost    <br /><br /><br />

If the LIBOR rate is available on any fifteenth (15th) day but <br /><br /><br />
﻿is not published in the Financial Times in respect of such         <br /><br /><br />
day for any reason, the LIBOR rate chosen shall be that            <br /><br /><br />

If within the time limit of the three (3) months period provided   <br /><br /><br />

CONTRACTOR'S behalf constitute additional income to                     <br /><br /><br />
CONTRACTOR, and this additional income is also subject to A.R.E.        <br /><br /><br />

The "gross-up value" is an amount added to Provisional Income to        <br /><br /><br />
give "Taxable Income", such that the grossed-up value is equivalent     <br /><br /><br />
to the A.R.E. Income Taxes.                                             <br /><br /><br />
                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
 THEREFORE:                                                             <br /><br /><br />
 Taxable Income = Provisional Income plus Grossed-up Value              <br /><br /><br />
 and                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 Grossed-up Value = A.R.E. Income Tax on Taxable Income.                <br /><br /><br />
    If the "A.R.E. Income Tax rate", which means the effective          <br /><br /><br />
﻿         or composite tax rate due to the various A.R.E. taxes levied              <br /><br /><br />
         on income or profits, is constant and not dependent on the                <br /><br /><br />
         level of income, then:                                                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
 Grossed-up Value = A.R.E. income tax rate                                         <br /><br /><br />
                TIMES Taxable Income.                                              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
Combining the first and last equations above                                       <br /><br /><br />
Grossed-up Value= Provisional income X Tax Rate                                    <br /><br /><br />
                                        1 - Tax Rate                               <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
         where the tax rate is expressed as a decimal.                             <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
         The above computations are illustrated by the following                   <br /><br /><br />
         numerical example. Assuming that the Provisional Income is                <br /><br /><br />
         $10 and the A.R.E. Income Tax rate is forty percent (40%),                <br /><br /><br />
         then the Grossed-up Value is equal to:                                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                  $ 10X0.4 = $ 6.67                                <br /><br /><br />
                                  1 - 0.4                                          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

         Therefore:                                                                <br /><br /><br />
