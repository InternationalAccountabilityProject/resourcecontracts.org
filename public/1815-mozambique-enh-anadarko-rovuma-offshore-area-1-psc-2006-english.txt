Should any well forming part of the Exploration work commitment provided<br /><br />
for in Articles 4.2 and 4.3 be abandoned, for any reason other than a reason<br /><br />
specified in Article 4.5 below, before reaching the defined objectives of such<br /><br />
well, the Concessionaire shall drill a substitute well. In this event the relevant<br /><br />
Exploration Period shall be extended by a reasonable period of time as<br /><br />
MIREM may agree to allow the drilling and evaluation of the substitute well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise approved by MIREM, any well which forms part of the<br /><br />
Exploration work commitment provided for in Articles 4.2 and 4.3 shall be<br /><br />
drilled to such depth as set forth in those Articles, unless before reaching the<br /><br />
required depth:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
further drilling would in the reasonable opinion of the Concessionaire<br /><br />
present an obvious danger, due to such events as, but not limited to, the<br /><br />
presence of abnormal pressure or excessive losses of drilling mud;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
impenetrable formations are encountered;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MIREM agrees to terminate the drilling operation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In circumstances in which Concessionaire is permitted pursuant to Article 4.5<br /><br />
to drill any well to a lesser depth than required pursuant to Articles 4.2 or 4.3,<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall be deemed to have satisfied all the Concessionaire's<br /><br />
obligations in respect of that well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the drilling of Exploration Wells hereunder, the Concessionaire shall,<br /><br />
in accordance with applicable law, keep MIREM informed of the progress of<br /><br />
each well and shall:<br /><br />

all other relevant subsurface data and submit the same to MIREM as<br /><br />
soon as it has been completed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Minimum Expenditure obligations set forth in Articles 4.2 and 4.3 shall<br /><br />
not in respect of any period be satisfied unless the total Attributable<br /><br />
Expenditure for that period equals or exceeds the amount of the Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure for that period; provided, however, that if, at the end of any<br /><br />
Exploration Period, the work commitment for that period has been completed<br /><br />
15<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to the reasonable satisfaction of MIREM, the expenditure incurred by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during that period shall be deemed to equal or exceed the<br /><br />
applicable Minimum Expenditure for that period specified in Articles 4.2 or<br /><br />
4.3 .<br /><br />

for the initial Exploration Period or, as the case may be, the Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure obligations for the second Exploration Period, as the same may<br /><br />
have been reduced by the provisions of Article 4.10. For the purpose of this<br /><br />
Article 4.9(a), where a Person constituting the Concessionaire has undertaken<br /><br />
to fund payments in respect of Minimum Expenditure which would otherwise<br /><br />
have been payable by another Person constituting the Concessionaire, the<br /><br />
share of Minimum Expenditure of that Person constituting the Concessionaire<br /><br />
giving that undertaking will be deemed to include the share of Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure for which such other Person constituting the Concessionaire<br /><br />
would have been liable if no such undertaking had been given.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
United States dollars forty-three million (US$ 43,000,000) at<br /><br />
completion of each Well drilled pursuant to Article 4.3 (b) (ii).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.11 If, at the end of the initial Exploration Period or at the end of the second<br /><br />
Exploration Period, the Attributable Expenditure incurred by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during that period does not and is not, pursuant to Article 4.2<br /><br />
4.3 and 4.8, deemed to equal or exceed the Minimum Expenditure for that<br /><br />
period, MIREM shall notify the Concessionaire and shall, unless the full<br /><br />
amount of the shortfall has been met by the Concessionaire within thirty (30)<br /><br />
days of such notification, have the right to call on said guarantee for the<br /><br />
payment thereunder to MIREM of the full amount of the shortfall.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Articles 4.2 and 4.3, the number of additional Exploration Wells drilled and/or<br /><br />
the amount of seismic data acquired by the Concessionaire during such<br /><br />
Exploration Period may be carried forward and treated as work undertaken in<br /><br />
discharge of the Concessionaire's commitment to drill Exploration Wells<br /><br />
and/or seismic data acquired during the succeeding period; provided, however,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if by reason of the provisions of this Article the work commitment of the<br /><br />
Concessionaire for any period as specified in Articles 4.2 and 4.3 has been<br /><br />
fully discharged by the Concessionaire before that period commences, the<br /><br />

Cost Recovery and Production Entitlement<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Concessionaire shall bear and pay all costs incurred in carrying out the<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in which the Concessionaire participates, and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall recover such costs permitted by the provisions of this<br /><br />
EPC including Annex "C" of this EPC (hereinafter "Recoverable Costs"), and<br /><br />
shall be remunerated exclusively by means of an entitlement to quantities of<br /><br />
Petroleum to which the Concessionaire is entitled as herein provided.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions related to cost recovery and profit entitlement set out in this<br /><br />
Article shall apply to Petroleum with effect that the Government and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall have title in undivided participating entitlement to the<br /><br />
Petroleum available for sale in any given period. Unless otherwise instructed<br /><br />
by the Government the sale of such Petroleum shall take place on a joint<br /><br />
dedicated basis by the Concessionaire and the Concessionaire will hold those<br /><br />
entitlements in undivided proportions equal to the proportions in which during<br /><br />
that period each Party was entitled to Disposable Petroleum. Such instructions<br /><br />
shall not affect volumes of Petroleum subject to contract. Accordingly, the<br /><br />
proceeds from the sale on a joint dedicated basis of Petroleum in any given<br /><br />
period shall be divided between the Government and the Concessionaire in the<br /><br />
proportions in which they had title in undivided entitlements to the Petroleum<br /><br />
sold.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From the total quantity of Petroleum Produced, the Concessionaire may take a<br /><br />
portion thereof necessary to discharge the Concessionaire's obligation for the<br /><br />
Petroleum Production Tax. The balance of Petroleum remaining after the<br /><br />
aforesaid portion has been set aside is hereinafter referred to as "Disposable<br /><br />
Petroleum".<br /><br />

event that after the Effective Date there is a change in applicable law<br /><br />
the laws of the Republic of Mozambique of the kind referred to in<br /><br />
Article 11 and as a result the Parties meet to agree on changes to be<br /><br />
made to this EPC, then during the period starting when the change in<br /><br />
the law comes into effect and ending when an agreement between the<br /><br />
Parties is reached pursuant to Article 11, the portion of Profit<br /><br />
Petroleum to which the Concessionaire and the Government would<br /><br />
otherwise be entitled shall be adjusted so that the net revenues to be<br /><br />
received by the Concessionaire from Petroleum Operations are the<br /><br />
same as they would have been if no change in the law had taken place.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where the Parties have reached agreement on the changes to be made<br /><br />
to this EPC pursuant to Article 11, this EPC will be deemed to stand<br /><br />
amended to the extent necessary to give effect to that agreement in<br /><br />
accordance with its terms.<br /><br />

9.12 Concessionaire's Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum calculations shall be<br /><br />
done for each calendar year on a cumulative basis. To the extent that actual<br /><br />
quantities and expenses are not known, provisional estimates based on the<br /><br />
approved work programme and operating and capital budgets shall be used.<br /><br />
Until such time as the value of Petroleum attributable to a year is determined,<br /><br />
the calculations will be based on the value of such Petroleum during the<br /><br />
preceding year and in the absence of such value, on the value agreed to<br /><br />
between MIREM and the Concessionaire. Adjustments shall be made during<br /><br />
the succeeding year based on actual Petroleum quantities, prices and expenses<br /><br />
in relation to such year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.13 Any Person constituting the Concessionaire, excluding ENH or a Permitted<br /><br />
Assignee, shall pay all costs properly incurred under this EPC in relation to the<br /><br />
State Participating Interest (herein referred to as "Carry") subject to the<br /><br />
following conditions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event of a third party other than an entity holding a State<br /><br />
Participating Interest or a Permitted Assignee has acquired a<br /><br />
Participating Interest in the EPC from any Person constituting the<br /><br />
Concessionaire, such third party shall be obliged to take over a<br /><br />
proportionate share of the Carry.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A State Participating Interest totally or partially transferred to a nonPermitted Assignee may only become effective provided all<br /><br />
outstanding amounts relating to the transferred interest and not yet<br /><br />
reimbursed to the Concessionaire subject to Carry have been paid by<br /><br />
the non-Permitted Assignee to Concessionaire proportionally to their<br /><br />
respective Participating Interests. The share of any future Carry, to be<br /><br />
paid by each Concessionaire subject to Carry, shall be calculated<br /><br />
according to the new composition of the Concessionaire subject to<br /><br />
Carry.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
32<br /><br />
<br /><br />
c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Carry shall be limited to all costs incurred by the Concessionaire<br /><br />
in discharging its obligations under this EPC, up to and including the<br /><br />
date upon which the first Development Plan has been approved.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Carry shall be used exclusively to pay for costs properly incurred<br /><br />
under this EPC in relation to the State Participating Interest. Save for<br /><br />
in respect of a transfer to a Permitted Assignee, ENH may not assign<br /><br />

directly or indirectly the benefits derived under the Carry. Any transfer<br /><br />
of a Participating Interest subject to the Carry requires the prior written<br /><br />
approval of MIREM. The term "Permitted Assignee" means for the<br /><br />
purpose of this Article the Government or a Mozambican Person<br /><br />
wholly owned and controlled by the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From the date of commencement of Commercial Production, ENH and<br /><br />
any entity designated by the Government to manage the State<br /><br />
Participation Interest portion shall reimburse in full the Carry in cash<br /><br />
or in kind to the Persons (other than ENH or a Permitted Assignee)<br /><br />
constituting the Concessionaire. Such reimbursement shall be<br /><br />
calculated as and taken from the Cost Petroleum of said Person having<br /><br />
benefited from the Carry. All Carry amounts owed up to approval of<br /><br />
the first Development Plan shall be subject to payment of interest in<br /><br />
United States dollars, compounded quarterly, calculated at the LIBOR<br /><br />
rate (as defined in and determined in accordance with Article 28.7)<br /><br />
plus one (1) percentage point, from the date such costs are incurred by<br /><br />
the Persons (other than ENH or a Permitted Assignee) constituting a<br /><br />
Concessionaire until reimbursed in full.<br /><br />

Valuation of Petroleum<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1 The value of Petroleum referred to in Articles 9 and 11 shall, to the extent<br /><br />
such Petroleum consists of Crude Oil, be determined at the end of each<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
calendar month commencing with the calendar month in which Commercial<br /><br />
Production of Crude Oil begins. To the extent such Petroleum consists of<br /><br />
Natural Gas it shall be determined at the end of each calendar month<br /><br />
commencing with the calendar month in which commercial delivery at the<br /><br />
Delivery Point begins.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2 A value for each separate export grade of Crude Oil will be:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />

in the case of sales to non-Affiliated Companies, the weighted average<br /><br />
price per barrel at the Delivery Point of each separate export grade of<br /><br />
Crude Oil being the prices FOB within the meaning defined in<br /><br />
Incoterms 2000, at which such Crude Oil has been sold by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during that calendar month; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Concessionaire sells the Crude Oil to a third party on terms<br /><br />
different from FOB (as per Incoterms 2000), then for the purpose of<br /><br />
this EPC, a calculated net-back FOB price shall be applied. The netback FOB price shall be established by deducting from the price<br /><br />
agreed the actual and direct costs incurred by the Concessionaire in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
fulfilling the obligations under their sales contract additional to those<br /><br />
obligations included under a FOB contract.<br /><br />

Decommissioning<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.1 If in the reasonable expectation of the Concessionaire, the Concessionaire will<br /><br />
cease to produce Petroleum under this EPC from the EPC Area, the EPC<br /><br />
expires, is cancelled or surrendered pursuant to the proceedure stipulated in<br /><br />
this EPC and applicable law the Concessionaire shall submit to MIREM for<br /><br />
approval a Decommissioning Plan. The Decommissioning Plan shall be<br /><br />
prepared in accordance with applicable law and shall include but not be<br /><br />
limited to:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
particulars, separately set out in respect of each Development and<br /><br />

prevent hazard to human life, or to the property of others or to<br /><br />
the environment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
estimates of the time required to complete operations under the plan;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a budget for operations under the plan, including particulars of the<br /><br />
costs of decommissioning equipment and installations;<br /><br />

meet the costs of implementing the plan; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
52<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
such environmental, engineering and feasibility studies as may be<br /><br />
necessary to support the proposed plan.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.2 The Decommissioning Plan shall be prepared in compliance with applicable<br /><br />
law and the provisions of Article 28 and shall ensure that decommissioning is<br /><br />
conducted in a manner which will give effect to standards generally<br /><br />
recognised as applicable in the international petroleum industry and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire's standards for decommissioning.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.3 In the event that the Concessionaire does not submit a Decommissioning Plan<br /><br />
to MIREM within the time allowed, MIREM may serve upon the<br /><br />
Concessionaire a notice requiring the Concessionaire to submit to MIREM,<br /><br />
within a period of ninety (90) days from date on which the notice was served,<br /><br />
a Decommissioning Plan. If within that period no Decommissioning Plan is<br /><br />
submitted, MIREM may commission consultants of international standing to<br /><br />
prepare a Decommissioning Plan.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.4 A Decommissioning Plan prepared by a consultant in accordance with<br /><br />
applicable law and this Article shall be implemented by the Concessionaire in<br /><br />
accordance with its terms as though it were an obligation of the<br /><br />
Concessionaire set forth in Article 28. The cost of commissioning engineering<br /><br />
consultants to prepare a consultant's plan shall be payable by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire to the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.5 In the event that the Concessionaire considers that production from a<br /><br />
Development and Production Area will cease before a Decommissioning Plan<br /><br />
has been prepared, decommissioning measures for that Development and<br /><br />
Production Area will be prepared by the Concessionaire in accordance with<br /><br />
the requirement for decommissioning set out in Articles 15.3 and 15.4, and<br /><br />
where those measures have been approved by MIREM will take effect as an<br /><br />
amendment to the Development Plan for that Development and Production<br /><br />
Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
53<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.6 Not later than at the commencement of Petroleum production from within the<br /><br />
EPC Area, the Concessionaire shall establish in a bank of its choice an interest<br /><br />
bearing United States dollar account or such other currency account to be<br /><br />
mutually agreed by the Parties to be denominated as the Decommissioning<br /><br />
Fund into which the Concessionaire shall set aside from time to time funds to<br /><br />
be able to cover the decommissioning costs calculated in accordance with this<br /><br />
EPC to meet the estimated costs of implementing an approved<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning Plan. At the time of establishment of the account for the<br /><br />
Decommissioning Fund the Concessionaire shall deposit United States dollars<br /><br />
fifty thousand (US$ 50,000) or equivalent if an alternative currency is agreed.<br /><br />

15.7 The calculation and payments of estimated future decommissioning costs into<br /><br />
the Decommissioning Fund shall be governed as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a) The estimates of: (i) the initial recoverable reserves and the projected<br /><br />
production schedule and (ii) total decommissioning costs for the<br /><br />
Concessionaire proposed decommissioning solution as well as reasonable<br /><br />
alternative decommissioning solutions, shall be prepared by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire in United States dollars or in such other currency determined<br /><br />
by applicable law and submitted for Government approval. The Government<br /><br />
shall select from the proposals submitted by the Concessionaire a preliminary<br /><br />
decommissioning solution to form the basis for the calculation of<br /><br />
decommissioning costs to be covered by the Decommissioning Fund created<br /><br />
for the purpose of covering such decommissioning costs. Adequate provisions<br /><br />
for successive revisions of such estimates shall, when required herein, required<br /><br />
by applicable law or deemed necessary by the Concessionaire due to<br /><br />
substantial changes in fact also be included in any updated Decommissioning<br /><br />
Plan.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b) In any calendar year in which the Concessionaire did not submit to the<br /><br />
Government a revised Decommissioning Plan or the total estimated<br /><br />
decommissioning cost, Concessionaire shall update the value of the latest total<br /><br />
estimated decommissioning cost preliminary approved by the Government in<br /><br />
order to account for the United States dollar (or when applicable any other<br /><br />
54<br /><br />
<br /><br />
/4,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
relevant currency) escalation of such approved estimated decommissioning<br /><br />
costs in the period between the calendar year in which such costs were<br /><br />
estimated and the then current calendar year. For this purpose, and for each<br /><br />
calendar year, the applicable annual United States dollar escalation index shall<br /><br />
be based on the Producers Price Index for the Drilling of Oil and Gas Wells as<br /><br />
published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual index to<br /><br />
be used in year "n" shall be determined by difference between the annual<br /><br />
index relating to the year in which the latest approved estimate is determined<br /><br />
and the same annual index relating such year "n". In the event the United<br /><br />
States Bureau of Labor Statistics ceases, for any reason whatsoever, to publish<br /><br />
the Producers Price Index for the Drilling of Oil and Gas Wells or when an<br /><br />
alternative currency is selected, the Parties shall determine either an<br /><br />
alternative independent internationally recognised source, or an alternative<br /><br />
representative index.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.8 The Concessionaire will not withdraw money from the Decommissioning<br /><br />
Fund save for the purpose of meeting the costs of implementing an approved<br /><br />
Decommissioning Plan and all statements relating to the Decommissioning<br /><br />
Fund provided by the bank from time to time shall be copied to MIREM.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.9 Payments into the Decommissioning Fund shall be cost recoverable in<br /><br />
accordance with provisions applicable to this EPC.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.10 Costs incurred by the Concessionaire to implement an approved<br /><br />
Decommissioning Plan shall be cost recoverable in accordance with<br /><br />
provisions in that regard set out in Article 9 and for the purpose of IRPC shall<br /><br />
be treated as an operating expense save where, in either case, such costs have<br /><br />
been funded by withdrawals from the Decommissioning Fund.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.11 Any funds remaining which have been cost recovered in the Decommissioning<br /><br />
Fund after the approved Decommissioning Plan has been completed shall be<br /><br />
treated as Profit Petroleum and the remaining balance shall be shared in<br /><br />
accordance with the provision of Article 9.10.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
55<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.12 In the event that at the time of implementing any Decommissioning Plan there<br /><br />
are insufficient funds available in the Decommissioning Fund to fund the<br /><br />
operations of that plan, the shortfall shall be met in full by the Concessionaire.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Delivery Point.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.2 The Concessionaire shall finance the cost of all facilities and equipment to be used<br /><br />
in Petroleum Operations. Subject to applicable law and this Article the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall have the right to use such facilities and equipment for<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations during the term of this EPC and any extensions thereof until<br /><br />
the EPC expires, is surrendered or cancelled, in which case the title to said<br /><br />
facilities and equipment at the option of the Government and without additional<br /><br />
compensation may by transferred to the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.3 Concessionaire shall be the owner of facilities and necessary appurtenant<br /><br />
equipment for the purpose and use in Petroleum Operations under this EPC unless<br /><br />

petroleum law have the right to the use of available spare capacity of facilities and<br /><br />
necessary appurtenant equipment on terms and conditions to be agreed between<br /><br />
the parties and acceptable to the Government. Such terms and conditions shall<br /><br />
include a tariff that shall represent the payment for the Concessionaire's cost of<br /><br />
additional investments required for facilitating such third party use as well as<br /><br />
operational costs and a profit element reflecting the risk taken by the owner of the<br /><br />
facilities. The tariff for third party use of facilities and appurtenant equipment<br /><br />
67<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall be subject to approval by the Government. When the parties can not agree to<br /><br />
access or a reasonable tariff for third party use, the matter may, be settled by: (a)<br /><br />
an independent commission of three (3) members acting as experts selected in<br /><br />
accordance with Articles 30.3(i), 30.5 and 30.6; (b) arbitration; or, (c) the<br /><br />
competent judicial authorities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.5 Third party use of facilities and necessary appurtenant equipment shall only take<br /><br />
place when such third party use is not materially negatively affecting<br /><br />

assets or exercises effective control of such property or assets.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event of a breach of Article 27.11(a), nothing in the provisions of<br /><br />
Article 19.5 shall be read or construed as preventing consideration of the<br /><br />
projected flow of profits (if any) from Petroleum Operations hereunder for<br /><br />
the purpose of determining the value of property or assets expropriated,<br /><br />
nationalised or made subject to intervention.<br /><br />

soon as possible after any of the above-mentioned situations occur, meet to<br /><br />
verify and agree on the changes, in all cases, that may be required to the EPC in<br /><br />

failure or contravention results in any environmental damage, the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall take all necessary and reasonable measures to remedy<br /><br />
such failure or contravention and the effects thereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
28.5 (a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Government has reasonable grounds to believe that any works or<br /><br />
installations erected by the Concessionaire or any operations carried<br /><br />
out by the Concessionaire in the EPC Area are endangering or may<br /><br />
endanger Persons or any property of any other Person or is causing<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Government on account of their special knowledge of environmental matters,<br /><br />
to carry out an environmental impact study on terms of reference determined<br /><br />
by the Concessionaire and approved by the Government, in order to establish<br /><br />
what the effect will be on the environment, human beings, wildlife or marine<br /><br />
life in the EPC Area in consequence of the Petroleum Operations to be<br /><br />
undertaken under this EPC.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
28.7 If the Concessionaire fails to comply with any terms contained in this Article<br /><br />

be necessary to cure such failure, and recover, immediately after having taken<br /><br />
such action, all payments incurred in connection with such action from the<br /><br />
Concessionaire together with interest at the prevailing LIBOR rate plus one<br /><br />
(1) percentage point compounded quarterly and calculated from the date such<br /><br />
expenditure is made until repaid. "LIBOR" means the annual rate equal to the<br /><br />
three (3) month term of the London interbank offered rate for United States<br /><br />

shall be an independent and impartial person of international standing with<br /><br />
relevant qualifications and experience appointed pursuant to the mutual<br /><br />

of applicable procedure of this EPC. If the Parties are unable to agree on the<br /><br />
appointment of a sole expert within twenty (20) days after a Party has received<br /><br />
a notice of referral under this Article the sole expert shall be selected by the<br /><br />
ICC Centre for Expertise, and the person so selected shall be appointed by the<br /><br />
Parties.<br /><br />

sole expert shall be copied to the other Party, and any oral submissions to the<br /><br />
sole expert shall be made in the presence of all Parties and each Party shall<br /><br />
have a right of response. The sole expert may obtain any independent<br /><br />
professional or technical advice as the sole expert considers necessary. The<br /><br />
English version of this EPC signed by the Parties shall be used as the official<br /><br />
translation in any determination by the sole expert. The fees and expenses of a<br /><br />
sole expert appointed under the provisions of Article 30.5 shall be borne<br /><br />
equally by the Parties.<br /><br />

interim or final arbitral award (a) rendered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal on the<br /><br />
limited grounds and in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article 52 of<br /><br />
