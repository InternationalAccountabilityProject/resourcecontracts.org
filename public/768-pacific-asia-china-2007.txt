23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
adopted annual Work Program and budget shall be submitted to CUCBM for review and consent within one (l) month as of<br /><br />
the date on which they are submitted to JMC. Within fifteen (15) days following the receipt of the annual Work Program<br /><br />
and budget, CUCBM shall notify JMC in writing of its consent or dissent or any modifications thereto with its detailed<br /><br />
reasons. If CUCBM requests any modifications to the aforesaid annual Work Program and budget, the Parties shall<br /><br />
promptly hold meetings to make modifications and any modifications agreed upon by the Parties shall be effected<br /><br />
immediately. In case CUCBM fails to notify JMC in writing of its consent or dissent or any modification within fifteen<br /><br />
(15) days, the annual Work Program and budget adopted by JMC shall be deemed to have been consented by CUCBM.<br /><br />
The Operator shall make its best efforts to perform the CBM Operations in accordance with the consented annual Work<br /><br />
Program and budget. For reviewing Work Program and budget by JMC, the Operator shall provide to JMC the supporting<br /><br />
data when requested. During the exploration period, the budgets so consented by CUCBM shall be sufficient to allow the<br /><br />
Operator to fulfill the Work Programs including those Work Programs under Article 7.3.1 hereof and the obligations under<br /><br />
the Contract.<br /><br />
10.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Operator may, in accordance with the following provisions, incur excess expenditures or expenditures outside the<br /><br />
budget in carrying out the Work Program and budget, provided that the objectives of the consented Work Program and<br /><br />
budget are not changed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2.1 In carrying out an consented budget for a single item, such as the drilling of a well, the Operator may, if necessary, incur<br /><br />
excess expenditures of no more than ten percent (10%) of the budgeted amount. The Operator shall report the aggregate<br /><br />
amount of all such excess expenditures to JMC for confirmation on a Calendar Quarter basis.<br /><br />
10.2.2 For the efficient performance of the CBM Operations, the Operator may, without consent, undertake certain individual<br /><br />
projects which are not included in the Work Program and budget, for a maximum expenditure of One Hundred Thousand<br /><br />
U.S. dollars (U.S.$100,000), but the Operator shall, within ten (10) days after such expenditures are incurred, report to<br /><br />
JMC for confirmation. In case of emergency, the Operator may incur emergency expenditures for the amount actually<br /><br />
needed but shall report such expenditures to JMC as soon as they are made. However, the said emergency expenditures<br /><br />
shall not be subject to Articles 10.2.3 and 10.2.4 herein.<br /><br />
10.2.3 In the event that the aggregate of excess expenditures under Article 10.2.1 herein and expenditures under Article 10.2.2<br /><br />
herein incurred in a Calendar Year cause the total expenditures of that Calendar Year to exceed the consented annual<br /><br />
budget, such excess shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the consented annual budget for that Calendar Year. If the<br /><br />
aforesaid excess is expected to be in excess of five percent (5%) of the annual budget, the Operator shall present its reasons<br /><br />
therefore to JMC and obtain its approval prior to incurring such expenditures.<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2.4 When JMC confirms the excess expenditures mentioned in Articles 10.2.1 herein, and the expenditures mentioned in<br /><br />
Article 10.2.2 herein:<br /><br />
(a) if expenditures or excess expenditures are determined to be reasonable, the Operator may incur such expenditures or<br /><br />
excess expenditures again during the same Calendar Year, subject to Article 10.2 herein; or<br /><br />
(b) if expenditures or excess expenditures are determined to be unreasonable, the Operator shall not incur such<br /><br />
expenditures or excess expenditures again during the same Calendar Year and such unreasonable expenditures or<br /><br />
excess expenditures shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 5.4 of Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto.<br /><br />
However, with respect to the joint operation conducted by the Contractor and CUCBM specified in Article 8.8 hereof,<br /><br />
this provision shall not be applicable.<br /><br />
Article 11<br /><br />
Determination of Commerciality of CBM<br /><br />
11.1 If any CBM Discovery is made within the Contract Area, the Operator shall promptly report such discovery to JMC. If JMC<br /><br />
or the Contractor makes a decision that a CBM Discovery is worthy of a Pilot Development, the Operator shall submit to<br /><br />
JMC a Pilot Development Work Program which shall include disposal of any CBM and/or Liquid Hydrocarbons whether by<br /><br />
sale, flaring or otherwise and timetable for such CBM Discovery as soon as possible. Such Pilot Development Work<br /><br />
Program shall be worked out no later than ninety (90) days from the date of the aforesaid decision made by JMC or the<br /><br />
Contractor. The Pilot Development Work Program shall, in so far as is practicable, be based on conducting the Pilot<br /><br />
Development work continuously, with a view to commencing operations within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the<br /><br />
date of the aforesaid decision made by JMC or the Contractor.<br /><br />
11.2 After the approval by JMC of the Pilot Development Work Program referred to in Article 11.1 herein, the Operator shall<br /><br />
carry out the operations as soon as possible without unreasonable delay in accordance with the timetable set forth in the<br /><br />
approved Pilot Development Work Program.<br /><br />
11.3 Unless otherwise specified in the Pilot Development Work Program, within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the<br /><br />
completion of the Pilot Development, the Operator shall submit to JMC a detailed report on the evaluation of the potential<br /><br />
commerciality of the CBM discovery for review and discussion. Under special circumstances, the above-mentioned period<br /><br />
may be reasonably extended upon agreement of the Parties.<br /><br />
The Pilot Development report shall include the evaluation on geology, development, engineering and economics, the<br /><br />
Maximum Efficient Rate (MER)<br /><br />
25<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and the estimated duration of the production period determined in accordance with the international CBM industry practice.<br /><br />
11.4 If JMC decides unanimously that a CBM Discovery is non-commercial, at the request of the Contractor, the corresponding<br /><br />
area covered by the CBM Discovery may be retained in the Contract Area during the exploration period. But if, at the<br /><br />
expiration of the exploration period, JMC unanimously still considers the said CBM Discovery to be non-commercial, the<br /><br />
area covered by the CBM Discovery shall be excluded from the Contract Area. The preceding shall not apply to a CBM<br /><br />
Field which in the opinion of either Party has potential commercial value but which has not been developed due to a lack of<br /><br />
market, a shortage of consuming facilities or lack of transportation facilities and/or inability to negotiate longterm<br /><br />
transportation and/or sales agreements.<br /><br />
Prior to the expiration of the exploration period, if any Party considers that a CBM Discovery which has been determined to<br /><br />
be non-commercial needs to be reappraised because of some favorable factors, the Operator shall work out a new evaluation<br /><br />
report on that CBM Discovery and submit it to JMC for review and approval.<br /><br />
11.5 If the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the exploration period, advises JMC in writing that any CBM Discovery is noncommercial, the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived its rights of participating in the development of that CBM Field,<br /><br />
then, CUCBM shall have the right to solely develop such potential CBM Field.<br /><br />
11.6 Where the Parties consider a CBM Discovery to be potentially commercial, as the Operator, the Contractor shall work out<br /><br />
the Overall Development Program for that CBM Field. the Parties shall negotiate to reach an agreement on the development<br /><br />
of the said CBM Field in a manner that shall not interfere unreasonably with the expansion of coal mining operations in the<br /><br />
relevant coal field. The Overall Development Program and the agreement concerning the development shall be a<br /><br />
supplementary document and an integral part hereof after they are approved by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) of<br /><br />
the People’s Republic of China and the Department Designated by the State Council.<br /><br />
11.7 Longterm CBM, and CBM Products and Liquid Hydrocarbons transportation and sales agreements shall be concluded prior<br /><br />
to the Determination of Commerciality.<br /><br />
11.8 In the event of a CBM Field Straddling a Boundary or of a potentially commercial CBM Discovery straddling a boundary of<br /><br />
the Contract Area, CUCBM shall organize the Contractor and the neighboring party(ies) involved, which may include<br /><br />
CUCBM and/or it’s Affiliates, to work out a unitized or new Overall Development Program for such Field or Pilot<br /><br />
Development work program for such CBM Discovery. If such area is controlled solely by CUCBM and/or its Affiliates,<br /><br />
then the Contract Area<br /><br />
26<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall be extended to cover the CBM Field with the approval of Department Designated by the State Council.<br /><br />
11.9 If a CBM Discovery without commercial value within the Contract Area and a CBM discovery outside the Contract Area<br /><br />
can be most economically developed as a commercial CBM Field by common facilities jointly constructed; or if CBM<br /><br />
discovery without commercial value within the Contract Area, can be economically developed as a commercial CBM Field<br /><br />
by linking it up with existing facilities located outside the Contract Area, CUCBM shall organize the Contractor and the<br /><br />
neighboring party(ies) involved, which may include CUCBM and/or its Affiliates, to work out an equitable agreement for<br /><br />
construction or utilization and sharing the costs relative to said facilities.<br /><br />
11.10 In Article 11 those procedures which reference the Overall Development Program, shall be applied, by analogy in the<br /><br />
following circumstances: additional development projects referring to the Overall Development Program designed either to<br /><br />
improve the producing capability of the reservoir or to substantially increase the recoverable reserves therefrom through<br /><br />
additional investments. Any extension of the production period of the CBM Field due to such additional development<br /><br />
projects shall be subject to the related provision of Article 4.5 hereof.<br /><br />
11.11 Notwithstanding the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production or anything else to the contrary herein, the<br /><br />
allocation of the production from a Pilot Development shall be governed by the principles set forth in Articles 12 and 13<br /><br />
hereof.<br /><br />

Procedure hereto, and the provisions described here below. The Foreign Contractor shall use the U.S. dollars or other<br /><br />
convertible currencies as its investment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1.1 All the exploration costs required for Exploration Operations shall be provided solely by the Contractor. For purpose of the<br /><br />
Contract, all costs incurred during the extended period described in Article 4.3 hereof shall be deemed exploration costs<br /><br />
and shall be provided solely by the Contractor.<br /><br />
12.1.2 The development costs required for Development Operations in each CBM Field within the Contract Area shall be<br /><br />
provided by CUCBM and the Contractor in proportion to their respective participating interests: forty percent (40 %) by<br /><br />
CUCBM and sixty percent (60 %) by the Contractor,<br /><br />
27<br /><br />
<br /><br />
unless CUCBM applies the provisions of the second paragraph of this Article 12.1.2 herein.<br /><br />
In the event that CUCBM, at its option, decides not to participate in the development of a CBM Field or decides to<br /><br />
participate in the development of such CBM Field to an extent of less than forty percent (40 %) of the participating<br /><br />
interest, CUCBM shall notify the Contractor in writing of its decision of non-participation or a specific lesser percentage of<br /><br />
the participating interests before the Pilot Development report is reviewed by JMC pursuant to Article 11.4 hereof. In such<br /><br />
case, if CUCBM does not participate in the development of such CBM Field, the development costs therein shall be borne<br /><br />
solely by the Contractor, or in case CUCBM participates in the development of such CBM Field to an extent of less than<br /><br />
forty percent (40 %) of the participating interests, such development costs shall be borne by the Parties in proportion to<br /><br />
their actual respective participating interests.<br /><br />
12.1.3 The operating costs incurred for the performance of the Production Operations of each CBM Field before the Date of<br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production shall be considered as development costs. The operating costs so incurred after<br /><br />
the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production shall be paid respectively by CUCBM and the Contractor in<br /><br />
proportion to their participating interests of the said CBM Field.<br /><br />
12.1.4 The Parties, on each others request, shall cooperate and assist each other to facilitate the financing of CBM Operations on<br /><br />
the best terms and conditions available. For the purpose of implementation of the Contract, CUCBM agrees that the<br /><br />
Contractor may, when financing, use the entitlement of its share of production under the Contract as a security for loans,<br /><br />
provided that the Contractor shall advise CUCBM in advance and the loan application therefore shall be examined by<br /><br />
CUCBM, and provided further that the rights and interests of CUCBM under the Contract shall not be impaired thereby.<br /><br />
12.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All the costs incurred in the performance of CBM Operations shall be recovered in accordance with Annex II —<br /><br />
Accounting Procedure hereto and the provisions described as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Seventy percent (70%) of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed as the “cost<br /><br />
recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” and shall be used for payments or for cost recovery in the following sequence:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.2.1 Payment in kind for the operating costs actually incurred (and any abandonment costs accrued per Article 4) but not yet<br /><br />
recovered by the Parties pursuant to Article 12.2.1 hereof based on the price of the said “cost recovery CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons” determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
13.2.2.2 The remainder of the “cost recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” shall, after payment for operating costs in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 13.2.2.1 herein, be deemed as “investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons”. Such<br /><br />
“investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” shall be used for the recovery of the exploration costs in respect<br /><br />
of the Contract Area which were incurred and not yet recovered by the Contractor, and shall be used for the recovery of<br /><br />
the development costs in respect of the CBM Field itself which were incurred and not yet recovered by CUCBM and the<br /><br />
Contractor in accordance with Articles 12.2.2 and 12.2.3 hereof, and Deemed Interest thereon. The method of recovery<br /><br />
and the recovery sequence are as follows:<br /><br />
(a) Beginning in the Calendar Year during which the production of any CBM Field within the Contract Area commences,<br /><br />
the “investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” referred to in Article 13.2.2.2 herein, based on the price<br /><br />
which has been determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof, shall be paid in kind first to the companies<br /><br />
comprising the Contractor for the recovery of the exploration costs which were incurred in respect of, and have not<br /><br />
yet been recovered from, the Contract Area.<br /><br />
The unrecovered exploration costs shall be carried forward to and recovered from the “investment recovery CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid<br /><br />
30<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons” in succeeding Calendar Years until fully recovered by the Contractor.<br /><br />
(b) Beginning in the Calendar Year during which the exploration costs incurred by the Contractor in respect of the<br /><br />
Contract Area have been fully recovered, the remainder of the “investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons”<br /><br />
of a CBM Field shall be used for the simultaneous recovery of the development costs incurred and not yet recovered<br /><br />
respectively by CUCBM and the Contractor and Deemed Interest thereon in respect of such CBM Field in proportion<br /><br />
to their respective participating interests therein based on the price of such remainder of the “investment recovery<br /><br />
CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof. The unrecovered development costs<br /><br />
and Deemed Interest thereon shall be carried forward to and recovered from the “investment recovery CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons” in succeeding Calendar Years until fully recovered.<br /><br />
(c) During the production period of a CBM Field, costs for an additional development project incurred pursuant to<br /><br />
Article 11.9 hereof and Deemed Interest thereon shall be recovered together with the unrecovered development costs<br /><br />
and Deemed Interest thereon. If the development costs and Deemed Interest thereon have been fully recovered, then<br /><br />
costs for the said additional development project and Deemed Interest thereon shall be recovered from the “investment<br /><br />
recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons” of such CBM Field referred to in Article 13.2.2.2 herein in accordance with<br /><br />
the provisions specified in Article 13.2 herein. The unrecovered costs for the additional development project and<br /><br />

In the above table, it is assumed that each cubic meter of CBM has a heating value of thirty-six thousand and nine<br /><br />
hundred sixty (36,960) BTU approximately. On this basis, a metric ton of Liquid Hydrocarbons in general will have a<br /><br />
heating value of forty- three (43) million BTU, or equivalent to 1,164 cubic meters of CBM. 1.0 kilo calorie is equal to<br /><br />
3.97 BTU. Adjustments will be made if actual heating value exceeds or is less than the above by ten percent (10%) or<br /><br />
more.<br /><br />

amount of approved annual budget to request each Investing Party to respectively make advances as specified by the<br /><br />

and approved by JMC shall be provided by all the Investing Parties to the Contract in proportion to their respective<br /><br />
participating interests in the development costs and shall bear no Deemed Interest. Based on the needs of the Production<br /><br />
Operations, the Operator may make timely adjustment of the amount of cash to be provided by all the Investing Parties to<br /><br />
the Contract. The Operator shall issue quarterly cash call notices to call for cash for the Production Operations. In proportion<br /><br />
to its share, each Investing Party shall respectively provide advances on a monthly basis in accordance with the requirement<br /><br />
and within the time limit specified in the cash call notice of the current month. The default provision specified in Article 3.2<br /><br />
of this Accounting Procedure shall also apply to any cash calls for Production Operations.<br /><br />
In case that the Operator, owing to the needs of the Production Operations, has to incur expenditures which are unforeseen in<br /><br />
the cash call for any month, written notices with explanations shall be issued to all the Investing Parties who shall finance<br /><br />
their own<br /><br />
shares for additional amount within ten (10) days following the receipt of such written notice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
According to the requirement of the CBM Operations, the Operator shall indicate in any cash call notice the U.S. dollar<br /><br />
equivalent of the total cash called. The Operator shall also specify the amounts of Renminbi and U.S. dollars required as<br /><br />
estimated to make payment. CUCBM shall provide the advance of its own share either in Renminbi or in Renminbi and U.S.<br /><br />
dollars with respect to the amounts called for by the Operator, but CUCBM’s funding in Renminbi shall not exceed the total<br /><br />
amount of Renminbi as indicated and called for by the Operator in any cash call notice. The Contractor shall provide the<br /><br />
advance of its own share in U. S. dollars.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provisions for recording the sources of funds:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.7.1 Funds for exploration costs, development costs and operating costs, when received, pursuant to each cash call shall be<br /><br />
credited against the relevant accounts of the Investing Parties in the Joint Account.<br /><br />
3.7.2 In case CUCBM decides to develop a CBM Field for its sole account pursuant to Article 11.5 of the Contract, or undertakes<br /><br />
any other operation for its sole account, the funds required shall be financed and accounted for separately.<br /><br />
3.7.3 In accordance with Article 6.3 of the Contract, if the Contractor opts to terminate the Contract as provided in Article 6.3<br /><br />
(c) of the Contract or if the phase is the last phase of the exploration period, the Contractor shall, within thirty (30) days<br /><br />
from the date of its decision to terminate the Contract or thirty (30) days from the date of the expiration of the exploration<br /><br />
period, pay CUCBM in U.S. dollars the unfulfilled balance of the minimum exploration<br /><br />
9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
work commitment (or of the new commitment) for the exploration phase, converted into cash. The detailed method by which<br /><br />
the unfulfilled balance of the minimum exploration work commitment is converted into U.S. dollars is that the actual average<br /><br />
unit cost of the last portion of a seismic line shot under the Contract or of the last well drilled, excluding the abnormal drilling<br /><br />
costs such as those of the sidetrack, fishing, severe loss of mud circulation, etc. (i.e. U.S. dollars/kilometer of seismic line;<br /><br />
U.S. dollars/meter of drilling footage), is multiplied by the unfulfilled amount of the minimum exploration work<br /><br />
commitment. The formula for such calculation is as follows:<br /><br />
I = Ac X Pu<br /><br />
in which:<br /><br />
I = converted cash amount of the unfulfilled balance of the minimum exploration work commitment;<br /><br />
Ac = actual average unit cost of the last portion of a seismic line shot or of the last well drilled; and<br /><br />
Pu = the unfulfilled amount of the minimum exploration work commitment (The unfulfilled amount of the seismic line shot is<br /><br />
the difference between the kilometers specified in Article 6.2 of the Contract and actual kilometers shot. The unfulfilled<br /><br />
footage of an unfulfilled Wildcat is the designed total depth of the Wildcat specified in accordance with Article 6.2 of the<br /><br />
Contract).<br /><br />
Article 4<br /><br />
Accounting and Management of Material<br /><br />
4.1 Procurement of Material:<br /><br />
The procurement of Material shall be implemented in accordance with the procedure specified in Articles 15.1 and 7.6 of the<br /><br />
Contract. In order to prevent overstocking of Material, the Operator shall use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the<br /><br />
procurement of Material shall be made in accordance with the Material procurement plans and that the quality of Material<br /><br />
conforms to specifications and prices are fair and reasonable. The Operator does not warrant the Materials furnished beyond,<br /><br />
or back of, the supplier’s or manufacturer’s guarantee.<br /><br />
4.2 Costs of procuring Material:<br /><br />
The costs of Material purchased shall be the invoice prices less discounts plus related transportation and other expenses,<br /><br />
including expenses for freight to the destination, insurance premiums commensurate with the Material covered, fees of<br /><br />
forwarding agents, duties, fees, handling expenses from shipside to and within any water or land terminal warehouse or yard,<br /><br />
and any other reasonable expenses actually paid and expenses of inland transportation.<br /><br />
10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.3 The provisions and procedures of Article 15.1 and Article 7.6 of the Contract and the following provisions shall be applied<br /><br />
