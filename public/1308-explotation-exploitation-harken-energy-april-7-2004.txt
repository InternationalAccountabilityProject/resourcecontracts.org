The retention right shall be subject to the concurrence of at least the following requirements:<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor must prove, to PERUPETRO’s satisfaction, that the volumes of Hydrocarbons discovered from the<br /><br />
Contract Area are insufficient to economically justify the construction of the Main Pipeline;<br /><br />
13<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Both the discoveries made in adjacent areas as well as the discoveries made by the Contractor are insufficient to<br /><br />
economically justify the construction of a main pipeline; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor must prove, on an economic basis, that the Hydrocarbons discovered cannot be transported from the<br /><br />
Contract Area to the place where they will be marketed, through any means of transportation.<br /><br />

Should the Contractor make a discovery of Non-Associated Natural Gas or Non-Associated Natural Gas and Condensates<br /><br />
during any period of the exploration phase, it may request a retention period of up to ten (10) Years for the Field or Fields<br /><br />
discovered, for the purpose of developing the market.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor makes a discovery of Petroleum and a discovery of Non-Associated Natural Gas or Non-Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas and Condensates during any period of the exploration phase, and the assumptions described in points 3.6 and<br /><br />
3.7 above take place, the Contractor may request a retention period for Petroleum and another retention period for NonAssociated Natural Gas or Non-Associated Natural Gas and Condensates, for the purposes referred to in said points.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The retention period referred to in points 3.6 and 3.7 above shall extend the Contract Term for a period equivalent to the<br /><br />
retention period granted by PERUPETRO.<br /><br />
The retention period shall be authorized in writing. For this purpose, the Contractor shall file an application with<br /><br />
PERUPETRO, attaching thereto the relevant supporting evidence and the schedule of activities to be carried out.<br /><br />
The exploration phase will end upon the commencement of the retention period. The exploitation phase will start upon the<br /><br />
declaration of Commercial Discovery in the retention period.<br /><br />
The granting of the retention period referred to in points 3.6 and 3.7 and the term thereof will be determined by<br /><br />
PERUPETRO in its sole discretion, without affecting or reducing the Contractor’s obligation to comply with the minimum<br /><br />
work program of the period of the exploration phase then under way.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.10 The Contractor must guarantee the fulfillment of the minimum work program of each period of the exploration phase,<br /><br />
pursuant to points 3.2 and 4.6, through a joint and several, unconditional, and irrevocable bank guaranty that may be<br /><br />
automatically executed in Peru without the benefit of<br /><br />
14<br /><br />
<br /><br />
exclusion, issued by a duly qualified entity of the financial system domiciled in Peru and accepted by PERUPETRO. At the<br /><br />
request of PERUPETRO, the Contractor will replace any guaranty already delivered by a new guaranty within a term of<br /><br />
fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of receipt of PERUPETRO’s request by the Contractor.<br /><br />
The amount of the guaranty for the minimum work program of each period of the exploration phase is the amount shown in<br /><br />
annexes “C-1” through “C-6”, which is obtained by multiplying the dollar equivalence, which for purposes hereof is<br /><br />
established in Annex “F” hereto, by the number of Exploration Work Units corresponding to each period, according to the<br /><br />
provisions of point 4.6.<br /><br />
The guaranties will be issued for each minimum work program, as per the form shown in annexes “C-1” through “C-6”, as<br /><br />
the case may be.<br /><br />

For the fulfillment of the obligations described in this point, the following provisions shall be borne in mind:<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the recording of 2D seismic lines, the corresponding kilometers will be counted from the initial shooting point to the<br /><br />
final shooting point on each seismic line.<br /><br />
To record 31) seismic lines, square kilometers will be determined on the basis of the surface area covered by the<br /><br />
program carried out.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Exploration Work Units referred to in this point will be performed in accordance with the table of equivalences<br /><br />
contained in Annex “F”.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Only the Exploration Work Units resulting from 2D or 3D seismic line recording work, and from the drilling of<br /><br />
Exploratory Wells, carried out in excess of the minimum work program during any period of the exploration phase, in<br /><br />
relation to the provisions set forth in point 4.6, will be acknowledged against the fulfillment of the minimum work<br /><br />
programs of the subsequent periods, and it will not be necessary to furnish the corresponding guaranty for the period in<br /><br />
which said Exploration Work Units are acknowledged, provided the minimum work program of the relevant period has<br /><br />
been fully complied with.<br /><br />
If Exploratory Wells are drilled, the Exploration Work Units to be acknowledged against future work will be determined<br /><br />
in accordance with the provisions set forth in Annex “F”, based on the difference between the final depth reached and<br /><br />
the depth established in point 4.7.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Before the commencement of each period of the exploration phase, the<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor must provide PERUPETRO with the program of exploration activities that have been scheduled in order to<br /><br />
comply with the number of Exploration Work Units it has committed itself to perform during said period. Any change in the<br /><br />
contents of said program must be reported by the Contractor to PERUPETRO before the corresponding change is made, by<br /><br />
filing a supporting technical report.<br /><br />
e) If the Contractor has opted to record seismic lines to comply with the minimum work program of the second period, then<br /><br />
the minimum work program of the third period must consist in the drilling of one (1) Exploratory Well.<br /><br />
f) If before the commencement of the fourth or fifth periods of the exploration phase, the Contractor has partially<br /><br />
relinquished the area, as provided for in point 4.2, and opts to perform Exploratory Work Units to comply with the<br /><br />
minimum work program of said periods, then the Exploratory Work Units referred to in points 4.6.4 and 4.6.5 will be<br /><br />
reviewed and adjusted at the beginning of said periods, and the Contractor must perform the number of Exploratory Work<br /><br />
Units obtained by applying the following criteria: (i) a total of two hundred (200) EWUs or four (4) EWUs for every ten<br /><br />
thousand hectares (10,000 ha), whichever is greater, for the fourth period; and (ii) a total of two hundred (200) EWUs or<br /><br />
five (5) EWUs for every ten thousand hectares (10,000 ha.), whichever is greater, for the fifth period.<br /><br />
4.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Exploratory Wells to be drilled in compliance with the minimum work program referred to in point 4.6 shall be deemed<br /><br />
drilled and, consequently, Contractor’s obligation fulfilled, once the Contractor reaches a minimum vertical depth (TVD) of<br /><br />
two thousand eighty hundred (2800) meters, measured from the surface, or a minimum of one hundred meters (100 m.) into<br /><br />
the Chonta formation whichever occurs earlier in time.<br /><br />
If before beginning the drilling of any Exploratory Well drilled in compliance with the minimum work programs referred to<br /><br />
in point 4.6, the Contractor proves, to PERUPETRO’s satisfaction, based on the results of the geological and geophysical<br /><br />
evaluations conducted, that it is not possible to comply with the objectives agreed upon in the first paragraph of this point,<br /><br />
the Parties may agree on a new geological objective and/or depth target.<br /><br />
Furthermore, if insurmountable geological or mechanical problems arise during the drilling of any Exploratory Well drilled<br /><br />
in compliance with the minimum work programs referred to in point 4.6, the Contractor may request that the drilling<br /><br />
obligation be considered fulfilled by filing a supporting technical report, which will be subject to the approval of<br /><br />
PERUPETRO.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor decides to make a declaration of Commercial Discovery, it shall give notice thereof to PERUPETRO,<br /><br />
submitting, within one hundred and eighty (180) Days following such declaration of Commercial Discovery,<br /><br />

Commercial Discovery, as well as any other information that the Contractor may deem convenient.<br /><br />
4.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PERUPETRO must provide the Contractor with its comments on the “Initial Development Plan” within sixty (60) Days<br /><br />
following receipt thereof, and may object to the Date of Commencement of Commercial Extraction, if it is not reasonably<br /><br />
appropriate. Should a discrepancy arise, the provisions set forth in point 21.2 shall be applicable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.10 Should the Contractor make a declaration of Commercial Discovery, it will be obliged to start Development within one<br /><br />
hundred and eighty (180) Days following the expiration of the sixty (60)-Day term referred to in point 4.9 hereof.<br /><br />
The declaration of Commercial Discovery will not imply a reduction in or the suspension of the obligations of the minimum<br /><br />
work program of the then current period.<br /><br />
4.11 The Development of the Hydrocarbons discovered shall be carried out in accordance with the work programs submitted by<br /><br />
the Contractor to PERUPETRO, as provided for in point 5.3.<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties agree that whenever it is deemed necessary and appropriate, the terms for the submission of the “Initial<br /><br />
Development Plan”, or the annual work programs, as the case may be, may be adjusted, extended, or modified. For this<br /><br />
purpose, the Contractor shall submit the necessary proposals to PERUPETRO in order to agree on any such adjustment,<br /><br />
extension, or modification.<br /><br />
4.12 The expiration of the exploration phase shall not affect the terms and conditions of the above-described procedures that may<br /><br />
be in progress at that time.<br /><br />
4.13 In exceptional cases that make the fulfillment of the obligations and/or terms of the periods of the minimum work programs<br /><br />
agreed upon in points 4.6 and 3.2, respectively, unfeasible, and at the request of the Contractor, which shall file a supporting<br /><br />
report therefor, the obligations of the periods of the minimum work program can be replaced and their terms extended, to<br /><br />
the extent PERUPETRO accepts and approves the request made by the Contractor. The change will in no event modify the<br /><br />
initial commitment agreed upon in Exploration Work Units for the exploration phase, reducing obligations.<br /><br />
Furthermore, when the results of exploration justify a new configuration of the Contract Area, at the request of the<br /><br />
Contractor, which shall file a supporting report therefor with PERUPETRO, the Contract Area can be delimited again,<br /><br />
provided the provisions set forth in point 4.3 are fulfilled, the Contractor files work proposals for the new area, and<br /><br />
PERUPETRO accepts and approves the new delimitation requested. The new delimitation will in no event expand the<br /><br />
original Contract area.<br /><br />
The changes accepted and approved by PERUPETRO in application of the preceding paragraphs will result in the review of<br /><br />
the amounts and terms of the agreed guaranties; for which reason, if applicable, the Parties will calculate the new amounts<br /><br />
of the guaranties and the Contractor will deliver a new guaranty or extend the existing one, for the new agreed term, in<br /><br />
accordance with the requirements set forth in points 3.4 and 3.10. The Exploration Work Units for the new area<br /><br />
incorporated will also be calculated.<br /><br />
CLAUSE FIVE - EXPLOITATION<br /><br />
5.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The exploitation phase starts on the Day following the end of the exploration phase, provided a declaration of Commercial<br /><br />
Discovery has been made during the exploration phase. However, at the Contractor’s option, the exploitation phase may<br /><br />
start ahead of time and the exploration phase will end on the Date of Commencement of Commercial Extraction. For the<br /><br />
retention period, the exploitation phase will start once the declaration of Commercial Discovery has been made.<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.2<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The Contractor has the right to use the Hydrocarbons produced from the Contract Area in its Operations, at no cost<br /><br />
whatsoever, for which reason said Hydrocarbons will riot be taken into account at the time of calculating the royalty. Said<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons can be processed at the topping plants of the Contractor in order -to be exclusively used in the Operations.<br /><br />
If the topping plant is located outside of the Contract Area, the Parties will measure the volume of Hydrocarbons produced<br /><br />
from the Contract Area that will be processed in the topping plant, including the volume of products to be used as fuel and<br /><br />
the, surplus volume returned to the Operations; the difference between the volumes that enter and leave the topping plant<br /><br />
will be taken into account for the calculation of the royalty in the corresponding valuation period and will be deducted<br /><br />
from the petroleum fiscalized outside of the Contract Area.<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall have the right to recover Liquid Hydrocarbons from any Natural Gas produced from the Contract Area,<br /><br />
and to extract the Liquid Hydrocarbons in any stage in which said Natural Gas is being handled.<br /><br />
Liquids so separated shall be considered Condensates for purposes of calculating Contractor’s royalty, unless it is not<br /><br />
possible, for economic or operating reasons, to collect said liquids and they can be commingled with Petroleum and<br /><br />
fiscalized together.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

When a commercially exploitable Field or Fields extend(s) continuously from the Contract Area into another area or areas,<br /><br />
the Contractor and the contractors who may have these areas must agree on the implementation of a single Exploitation<br /><br />
plan, or a common Exploitation plan. If no such agreement is reached, the Ministry of Energy and Mines shall refer the<br /><br />
differences to the technical conciliation committee referred to in Article 32 of Law No. 26221, whose resolution shall be<br /><br />
binding upon the Parties.<br /><br />
Furthermore, when a commercially exploitable Field or Fields continuously extends from the Contract Area to adjacent<br /><br />
areas that have not been assigned to a contractor or are not being negotiated or included in a competitive bidding or tender<br /><br />
process or in a process to select a contractor, and no limitation exists as to the protection of the environment, then, with the<br /><br />
prior approval of Contractor’s request by Perupetro, said adjacent areas will be incorporated into the Contract Area.<br /><br />
When a Reservoir or Reservoirs can be declared as a commercial development, they extend continuously into the Contract<br /><br />
Area towards unassigned adjacent areas, limited by environmental regulations or for being protected natural areas, the<br /><br />
Contractor, prior approval of PERUPETRO, may carry out directional drilling activities, with a point of origin within the<br /><br />
Contract Area and bottomhole underneath the aforementioned adjacent area, in order to develop all of the reserves in the<br /><br />
Reservoir or Reservoirs that are commercially exploitable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.10 Once the drilling of one (1) well is completed, the Contractor shall give PERUPETRO notice of the date on which the well<br /><br />
will be tested, if appropriate. The well must be tested within three (3) Months following the end of drilling, unless, for<br /><br />
technical reasons, the Contractor requires a longerterm to carry out the test.<br /><br />
23<br /><br />

determine the quality of the Fiscalized Hydrocarbons.<br /><br />
The measuring equipment and instruments shall be gauged from time to time pursuant to the applicable standards.<br /><br />
PERUPETRO’s representatives may be present in the gauging.<br /><br />
5.12 Prior to the Date of Commencement of Commercial Extraction, and in order to determine the volume and quality of<br /><br />
Fiscalized Hydrocarbons, the Parties shall agree on the corresponding measuring equipment, methods and procedures.<br /><br />
5.13 In order to produce Heavy Petroleum from the Contract Area, Heavy Petroleum can be commingled with light Petroleum<br /><br />
produced outside of the Contract Area. Said light Petroleum will be measured and fiscalized by the Parties at a measurement<br /><br />
point cat the time of entering the Contract Area.<br /><br />
The volume of Hydrocarbons produced outside of the Contract Area will be deducted from the volume of Hydrocarbons<br /><br />
Fiscalized in the Contract Area for purposes of calculating the royalty to be paid by the Contractor.<br /><br />

between the first and the fifteenth Day, of said calendar month, and the second fortnight is the period still to run until<br /><br />
the end of said calendar month.<br /><br />
The Valuation Period can be extended or shortened by agreement between the Parties, if so allowed by the<br /><br />
corresponding legal rules.<br /><br />
8.2.3 Basket Price: is the price, expressed in Dollars per Barrel, which represents the FOB value at Peruvian port of<br /><br />

The following will not be taken into account for the calculation of the Realized Price:<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any payment resulting from the reconciliation of volumes of Natural Gas contained in the respective purchase-sale<br /><br />
contracts.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Value Added Tax (IGV), the Selective Consumption Tax, the Municipal Promotion Tax and/or any other<br /><br />
consumption tax.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.2.5 Estimated Rate: is the transportation cost, expressed in Dollars per Barrel or Dollars per MMBtu, as the case may<br /><br />
be, from a Production Fiscalization Point to a sales or export point, or to another pipeline owned by third parties. This<br /><br />
cost shall take into account the items, methodology, and procedures referred to in the “Regulations for the<br /><br />
Transportation of Hydrocarbons by Pipeline”, any amendment thereto, or any other rule that may replace these<br /><br />
regulations.<br /><br />
8.2.6 Value of Fiscalized Petroleum: is the figure obtained by multiplying the Fiscalized Petroleum of any given<br /><br />
Valuation Period by the Basket Price of Fiscalized Petroleum for said period, after the corresponding Transportation<br /><br />
and Storage Cost, if applicable, has been deducted from said price.<br /><br />
8.2.7 Value of Fiscalized Condensates: is the figure obtained by<br /><br />
28<br /><br />
<br /><br />
multiplying the Fiscalized Condensates of any given Valuation Period by the Basket Price of Fiscalized Condensates<br /><br />

8.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor, at the time of making a declaration of Commercial Discovery of Hydrocarbons, will opt for one of the two<br /><br />
methodologies described in subpoints 8.3.1 and 8.3.2, whereupon it will not be allowed to change the methodology during the remaining Contract Term.<br /><br />
8.3.1 Methodology based on Production Scales: According to this methodology, a royalty percentage will be established<br /><br />
for Fiscalized Liquid Hydrocarbons and for Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids, and another royalty percentage will be<br /><br />
established for Fiscalized Natural Gas, for each Valuation Period, according to the following table:<br /><br />
Fiscalized<br /><br />
Production<br /><br />
MBCD<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Royalty<br /><br />
Percentage %<br /><br />
<br /><br />

> 100<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5<br /><br />
5 - 20<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
MBCD: Thousands of Barrels per calendar day<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When the total average Fiscalized Liquid Hydrocarbons and Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids is less than or equal to 5<br /><br />
MBCD, the 5% royalty percentage will be applied. When said average is equal to or higher than 100 MBCD, the 20%<br /><br />
royalty percentage will be applied. When said average fluctuates between 5 MBCD and 100 MBCD, the royalty<br /><br />
percentage obtained by applying the linear interpolation method shall be applied.<br /><br />
29<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The royalty to be paid by the Contractor for Fiscalized Liquid Hydrocarbons and Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids will<br /><br />
be the amount obtained by applying the royalty percentage obtained for said Hydrocarbons to the addition of the<br /><br />
Value of Fiscalized Petroleum, the Value of Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids, and the Value of Fiscalized Condensates,<br /><br />
in the Valuation Period.<br /><br />
To determine the average Fiscalized Natural Gas, in barrels per day, the following equivalence will be used: Barrels<br /><br />
will be equivalent to the volume of Fiscalized Natural Gas expressed in standard cubic feet, divided by a factor of<br /><br />
five thousand six hundred twenty six (5,626).<br /><br />
The royalty to be paid by the Contractor for Fiscalized Natural Gas will be the amount obtained by applying the<br /><br />
royalty percentage obtained for said Hydrocarbons to the Value of Fiscalized Natural Gas, in the Valuation Period.<br /><br />
8.3.2 Methodology based on the Economic Result (RRE): According to this methodology, the royalty percentage will be<br /><br />
the one obtained by adding the 5% fixed royalty percentage to the variable royalty percentage, in the manner shown<br /><br />
below:<br /><br />
RRE =<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5% + RV<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where:<br /><br />
RV : Variable Royalty %1<br /><br />
FRT-1 : Factor R<br /><br />
The Variable Royalty is applied when FRt-1 > 1.15 and within the following range:<br /><br />
0% < Variable Royalty < 20%<br /><br />
For negative RV results, 0% is considered; for RV results higher than 20%, 20% is considered.<br /><br />
Xt-1 : Revenues corresponding to the annual period immediately preceding the time at which the calculation of the<br /><br />
Variable Royalty is made. They include the items applicable to Factor Rt_1.<br /><br />
30<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Y t-1 :<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Expenditures corresponding to the annual period immediately preceding the time at which the<br /><br />
calculation of the Variable Royalty is made. They include the items applicable to Factor Rt_1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Factor Rt-1: Is the quotient between the revenues and expenditures accumulated from the Date of Signing until<br /><br />
period t-1, inclusive.<br /><br />
Period t-1 :<br /><br />

The calculation of the Variable Royalty percentage is made twice a year: the first time in January, based on the information<br /><br />
on Revenues and Expenditures corresponding to the period included between January and December of the preceding<br /><br />
calendar year, and the second time in July, based on the information on Revenues and Expenditures corresponding to the<br /><br />
period included between July of the preceding calendar year and June of the then current calendar year.<br /><br />
8.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For purposes of the Contract, the price of each class of Fiscalized Hydrocarbon will be expressed in Dollars per Barrel or in<br /><br />
Dollars per million Btu, as the case may be, and determined as follows:<br /><br />
8.4.1 To determine the Basket Price of Fiscalized Petroleum, the following procedure will be followed:<br /><br />
a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No less than ninety (90) Days prior to the Date of Commencement of Commercial Extraction, the Parties will<br /><br />
determine the quality of Petroleum to be produced from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within thirty (30) Days following the determination referred to in the preceding item, the Parties will select a<br /><br />
Petroleum basket that will include a maximum of four (4) components that must meet the following<br /><br />
requirements:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Their quality must be similar to the quality of the Petroleum to be measured at a Production<br /><br />
Fiscalization Point;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They must be regularly quoted at the “Platt’s Oilgram Price Report” or another source recognized by<br /><br />
the oil industry and agreed upon by the Parties; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
They must be competitive on the market or markets where the Petroleum to be measured at a<br /><br />
Production Fiscalization Point could be sold.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Once the determinations referred to in the preceding items have been made, the Parties will sign a “Valuation<br /><br />
Agreement” establishing terms and conditions additional to those set forth in this subpoint, as required for its<br /><br />
correct application.<br /><br />
The “Valuation Agreement” will define the adjustment procedures that may be required by reason of quality.<br /><br />
The quality adjustments shall consider prizes and/or penalties for any improvement and/or degradation<br /><br />
concerning the quality of the Fiscalized Petroleum in relation to the quality of the classes<br /><br />
32<br /><br />
<br /><br />
of Petroleum that make up the basket. Likewise, the “Valuation Agreement” will define its effective term and<br /><br />
the periodicity to review the agreed methods and procedures, so as to always guarantee a realistic<br /><br />
determination of the price of the Fiscalized Petroleum. If any of the Parties considers at any time that the<br /><br />
application of the methods and procedures established in the “Valuation Agreement” does not result in a<br /><br />
realistic determination of the FOB value, Peruvian port of export, of the Fiscalized Petroleum, the Parties<br /><br />
may agree upon the application of other methods and procedures that actually give such result.<br /><br />
d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Every six (6) Months, or earlier if so requested by any of the Parties, the Parties may review the basket<br /><br />
established for the valuation of Fiscalized Petroleum, in order to check whether the conditions listed above<br /><br />
are still met. If it is determined that any such condition is no longer met, the Parties must modify the basket<br /><br />
within thirty (30) Days following the date on which the review of the basket started. If after the expiration of<br /><br />
this term the Parties have not agreed upon a new basket, the procedure set forth in subpoint 8.4.5 shall be<br /><br />
followed.<br /><br />
If it is determined that the API gravity (weighted average), sulphur content, or any other element which<br /><br />
measures the quality of Fiscalized Petroleum has changed significantly with respect to the quality of the<br /><br />
components that make up the basket (simple arithmetic mean), the Parties must modify the composition of<br /><br />
the basket so that it will reflect the quality of the Fiscalized Petroleum.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that in the future the price of one or more of the classes of Petroleum that make up the basket<br /><br />
were quoted in a currency other than Dollars, such prices shall be converted into Dollars at the exchange rates<br /><br />
in force on the dates of each such quotation. The exchange rates to be used will be the average exchange rates<br /><br />
quoted by Citibank N.A. of New York, New York. In the absence of this banking institution, the Parties will<br /><br />
agree on the institution that will properly replace it.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
f)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Basket Price to be used for the valuation of Fiscalized Petroleum during a Valuation Period will be<br /><br />
determined as follows:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The average price of each class of Petroleum that makes up the basket shall be determined by<br /><br />
calculating the arithmetic mean of its quotations published during the<br /><br />
33<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Valuation Period. Only the Days in which all basket components have been quoted shall be considered.<br /><br />
It is hereby understood that if in a regular edition of the “Platt’s Oilgram Price Report” two or more<br /><br />
quotations are listed for the same basket component, the quotation that is closer to the publication date<br /><br />
will be used as a basis (“Prompt Market”); and<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The average prices resulting from the above-mentioned procedure, for each basket component,<br /><br />
shall be in turn averaged in order to obtain the Basket Price corresponding to the value of the<br /><br />
Fiscalized Petroleum.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.4.2 To calculate the Basket Price of Fiscalized Condensates, the procedure described in subpoint 8.4.1 shall be followed,<br /><br />
to the extent applicable. The Parties may agree to make the necessary adjustments in order for the Basket Price to<br /><br />
reflect in the best possible manner the value of the Fiscalized Condensates.<br /><br />
8.4.3 To calculate the Basket Price of Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids, the procedure described in subpoint 8.4.1 shall be<br /><br />
followed, to the extent applicable. The Parties may agree to make the necessary adjustments in order for the Basket<br /><br />
Price to reflect in the best possible manner the value of the Fiscalized Natural Gas Liquids.<br /><br />
8.4.4 The price of Fiscalized Natural Gas will be represented by the Realized Price, which must reflect the sales price on<br /><br />
the local market or at an export point in the national territory, as the case may be. The minimum value to be applied<br /><br />
as Realized Price will be 0.60 US$/MMBtu.<br /><br />
8.4.5 In the event -the Parties are unable to reach any of the agreements contemplated by this point, the provisions set forth<br /><br />
in point 21.2 shall be applicable.<br /><br />
8.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the provisions set forth in point 2.5, item d), of annex “E”, Accounting Procedure, if at anytime the<br /><br />
Parties determine that there has been a mistake in the calculation of factor Rt_1 and, as a result, it is determined that a<br /><br />
different factor Rt_1 should be applied or that factort_1 should have been applied at a different time, the corresponding<br /><br />
correction will be made and will affect the period in which the mistake was made, and the royalty percentage will be<br /><br />
adjusted as from said period. Every adjustment resulting from a smaller royalty payment shall accrue interest in favor of the<br /><br />
aggrieved Party as from the moment the mistake was made. Refunds made to the Contractor for a higher royalty payment<br /><br />
shall be drawn from the balances that PERUPETRO is to transfer to the Treasury.<br /><br />
34<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The amount of the royalty will be calculated for each Valuation Period. The respective payment will be made in Dollars on<br /><br />
or before the second Business Day after the end of the corresponding fortnight, and PERUPETRO must issue the respective<br /><br />
certificate in the name of the Contractor, according to law. The volume of Fiscalized Hydrocarbons of each fortnight shall<br /><br />
be supported by the fiscalization slips to be delivered by PERUPETRO to the Contractor, duly signed as an indication of<br /><br />
agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On the contrary, if the Contractor fails to pay to PERUPETRO, whether in whole or in part, the amount of the royalty within<br /><br />
the term set forth in point 8.6, the Contractor will make available to PERUPETRO the Hydrocarbons owned by it and<br /><br />
extracted from the Contract Area, by the amount required to cover the amount of the debt, the expenses incurred, and the<br /><br />
corresponding interest pursuant to point 19.6.<br /><br />

described in point 21.3 of the Contract.<br /><br />
The Parties, within sixty (60) Days counted as from the Date of Signing, will agree on the procedure to be followed for the<br /><br />
functioning of this committee.<br /><br />
The resolutions issued by the Technical Conciliation Committee must be issued within a term of thirty (30) Days following<br /><br />
its installation and will be binding upon the Parties, as long as an arbitration award, if applicable, does not resolve the<br /><br />
conflict on a definitive basis. Without prejudice to the fulfillment of the resolution issued by the Technical Conciliation<br /><br />
Committee, any of the Parties can resort to arbitration in accordance with the provisions set out in point 21.3 within a term<br /><br />
of sixty (60) Days following the date of receipt of the service of notice of the respective resolution.<br /><br />
21.3 Arbitration Agreement<br /><br />
Any suit, controversy, discrepancy or claim arising out of or related to the Contract, such as the interpretation, fulfillment,<br /><br />
termination, efficacy or validity of the Contract, which arises between the Contractor and PERUPETRO and cannot be<br /><br />
resolved by mutual agreement between the Parties, shall be settled by international de Jure arbitration, pursuant to the<br /><br />
provisions contained in Article 68 of Law No. 26221.<br /><br />
The arbitration process shall be carried out in the Spanish language and in accordance with the! terms and conditions agreed<br /><br />
upon in this clause. The<br /><br />
50<br /><br />
<br /><br />
arbitration process shall be managed by the International Chamber of Commerce, hereinafter referred to as the “ICC”. As to<br /><br />
all matters not contemplated in this clause, the arbitration shall be organized and carried out in accordance with ICC’s<br /><br />
Arbitration Regulations in force on the Date of Signing. In addition to the provisions set forth in this clause and in the<br /><br />
aforementioned Regulations, the provisions contained in the General Arbitration Law No. 26572 or in any law that may<br /><br />
replace it, shall be applicable on a supplementary basis.<br /><br />
There will be three (3) arbitrators. Each Party will appoint one arbitrator and the third one will be appointed by the<br /><br />
arbitrators designated by the Parties. If the arbitrators appointed by the Parties fail to appoint the third arbitrator within<br /><br />
thirty (30) Days following their designation, any of the Parties may request the ICC to appoint said arbitrator.<br /><br />
The subject matter of the dispute, controversy, difference or claim shall be defined by the complaint, the answer to the<br /><br />
complaint and, eventually, if any, the counterclaim and the answer to the counterclaim. At the request of any of the Parties,<br /><br />
if the complaint or the counterclaim has not been answered within a term of fifteen (15) business Days counted as from the<br /><br />
respective notice, the arbitrators will be authorized to define the controversy should any of the Parties refuse to do it.<br /><br />
To solve the dispute, controversy, difference or claim referred to arbitration, the arbitrators shall abide by the domestic laws<br /><br />
of the Republic of Peru.<br /><br />
The arbitration shall take place in the city of Lima, Peru, unless the Arbitration Court cannot meet in this city for reasons<br /><br />
beyond the control of its members. In such event, the Parties will agree on another place to carry out the arbitration process.<br /><br />
If within a term of fifteen (15) Days counted as from the notice sent to the Parties regarding the obstacle faced by the<br /><br />
arbitrators, the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the new place of arbitration, the ICC will fix the place.<br /><br />
If the amount of the issue referred to arbitration exceeds Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000.00) and one of<br /><br />
the Parties considers that the arbitration should be held in another city or country, it must express its opinion, proposing a<br /><br />
new city or country in the first written notice addressed to the other Party advising it of its decision to resort to arbitration. If<br /><br />
within fifteen (15) Days following delivery of the above-mentioned notice, the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on<br /><br />
the new place of arbitration, the ICC will fix it.<br /><br />
Should a discrepancy arise regarding the amount of the controversy, or if the amount cannot be determined, the ICC will<br /><br />
establish the place of arbitration, taking into account the provisions set forth in the preceding paragraph.<br /><br />
51<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties hereby waive any remedy of appeal, appeal for annulment, or any other appeal against the arbitration award. An<br /><br />
appeal for annulment against the arbitration award will only be admissible in the cases provided for in the law. The Parties<br /><br />
represent that the arbitration award will be final and binding upon the parties, and shall be immediately enforced.<br /><br />
The parties commit themselves to perform any act required to carry out the arbitration process until it is completed and the<br /><br />
award enforced.<br /><br />
The maximum term of the arbitration process shall be one hundred and eighty (180) Business Days counted as from the date<br /><br />
of installation of the Arbitration Court, or of the date of a similar event. If it is necessary to extend the term, the provisions<br /><br />
set forth in the ICC Arbitration Regulations shall be applicable.<br /><br />
If the arbitration award is issued outside of Peru, it shall be acknowledged and enforced in accordance with the “Agreement<br /><br />
on the Acknowledgment and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards” signed in New York on June 10, 1958 (the New<br /><br />
York Convention), or the “Inter American Agreement on International Commercial Arbitration” signed in Panama on<br /><br />
January 30, 1975 (the Panama Agreement), or with the relevant rules contained in the General Arbitration Law No. 26572,<br /><br />
or in any rule that may replace it, as determined by the Party requesting the acknowledgment and enforcement of the<br /><br />
arbitration award.<br /><br />
During the arbitration process, the Parties will continue discharging their contractual obligations, to the extent possible,<br /><br />
even those that are the subject matter of the arbitration process.<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the foregoing, if the subject matter of the arbitration process were the fulfillment of the contractual<br /><br />
obligations guaranteed by the guaranties referred to in point 3.10, the calculation of the respective term will be suspended<br /><br />
and said guarantees will not be executed and will remain in full force and effect during the arbitration process. To this end,<br /><br />
the Contractor must extend or replace said guaranties, as necessary.<br /><br />
21.4 The Parties waive any diplomatic claim.<br /><br />
21.5 This Contract is drawn up and construed in the Spanish language and, therefore, the Parties hereto hereby agree that this is<br /><br />
the only official version.<br /><br />
52<br /><br />
<br /><br />
CLAUSE TWENTY-TWO - TERMINATION<br /><br />
22.1 The termination of the Contract shall be governed by the provisions set forth herein and, on a complementary basis, by the<br /><br />
provisions contained in Law No. 26221 and, as to matters not contemplated therein, by the provisions set out in the Civil<br /><br />
Code.<br /><br />
Except for the cases referred to in point 22.3, if any of the Parties fails to comply with any of the obligations provided for in<br /><br />
the Contract due to reasons other than acts of God or Force Majeure or other non-imputable causes, the other Party may<br /><br />
give notice thereof to said Party, informing it of the default and of its intention to terminate the Contract at the end of a sixty<br /><br />
(60)-Day period, unless said Party corrects the default within said period or proves that the default is in the process of being<br /><br />
corrected.<br /><br />
If the Party that receives the notice of default questions or denies its existence, it may refer the issue to arbitration, in<br /><br />
accordance with the provisions set forth in clause twenty-one, within thirty (30) Days following the notice. In such event,<br /><br />
the calculation of the sixty (60)-Day term will be suspended until the Parties have been served notice of the arbitration<br /><br />
award, and the Contract will be terminated if, even though the default has been confirmed, said Party does not correct the<br /><br />
default or does not prove to the other Party that the default is in the process of being corrected, within said term.<br /><br />
The Contract can be terminated before the end of the Contract Term by express agreement between the Parties.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any default incurred by any of the Parties prior to the date of termination hereof regarding any of the obligations<br /><br />
provided for in the Contract shall be remedied by the Party in default, except for obligations that, by their very<br /><br />
nature, become extinguished upon termination of the Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.3 The Contract shall be terminated as a matter of law, without any prior procedure, in the following cases:<br /><br />
22.3.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event the Contractor fails to comply with the performance of the minimum work program of any period of<br /><br />
the exploration phase,<br /><br />
53<br /><br />
<br /><br />
after having used the extensions provided for in point 3.4, if appropriate, and without being supported by reasons<br /><br />
satisfactory to PERUPETRO, unless the provisions set forth in points .4.7 and 4.13 are complied with.<br /><br />
22.3.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If upon expiration of the exploration phase or of the retention period, whichever occurs later in time, no<br /><br />

the third party that will assume its contractual position.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.3.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event the corporate guaranty referred to in point 3.11 is not kept in force and the Contractor fails to replace<br /><br />
it within a maximum term of fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt by the Contractor of PERUPETRO’s<br /><br />
notice asking for said replacement; or in the event the entity that granted the guaranty referred to in point 3.11 is<br /><br />
declared insolvent, under dissolution or liquidation, or bankrupt, and the Contractor fails to give PERUPETRO<br /><br />
notice thereof within a maximum term of fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of PERUPETRO’s request,<br /><br />
identifying the third party that will assume the corporate guaranty, subject to PERUPETRO’s prior qualification<br /><br />
and acceptance.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.3.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event an arbitration award declares, in the cases referred to in point 22.1, a default and said default is not<br /><br />
rectified in accordance with the provisions set forth in said point, or by means of an arbitration award declaring<br /><br />
the termination of the Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.4 In accordance with the provisions set out in Article 87 of Law No. 26221, if the Contractor fails to comply with the<br /><br />
Environmental provisions, OSINERG will impose the pertinent sanctions, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines can even<br /><br />
terminate the Contract, subject to OSINERG’s previous report.<br /><br />
22.5 If the Contractor, or the entity that furnished the guaranty referred to in point 3.11, requests protection against the actions<br /><br />
taken by creditors, PERUPETRO may terminate the Contract should it deem that its rights under the Contract are no being<br /><br />
properly protected.<br /><br />
22.6 Upon termination of the Contract, the Contractor shall assign to the State, through PERUPETRO, unless it does not require<br /><br />
them, at no cost or charge<br /><br />
54<br /><br />
<br /><br />
whatsoever and in a good state of repair, maintenance and operation, except for normal wear and tear, all real property,<br /><br />
power facilities, camps, communication facilities, pipes, and other production equipment and facilities owned by the<br /><br />
Contractor, which will allow the continuation of the Operations.<br /><br />
If Petroleum, Non-Associated Natural Gas and/or Non-Associated Natural Gas and Condensates were Exploited together,<br /><br />
upon completion of the term referred to in point 13.1 for the Petroleum exploitation phase, the Contractor shall assign to the<br /><br />
State, through PERUPETRO, unless it does not require them, at no cost or charge whatsoever, in a good state of repair,<br /><br />
maintenance and operation, except for normal wear and tear, the goods and facilities involved in the Exploitation of<br /><br />
Petroleum, which are not required for the Exploitation of Non-Associated Natural Gas and/or Non-Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />

Natural Gas and Condensates, which have also been used in the Exploitation of Petroleum, even though they may continue<br /><br />
being owned by the Contractor, shall be used for both Exploitation operations. To this end, a contract shall be entered into<br /><br />
between the Parties.<br /><br />
If the Contractor has been using the goods and facilities described in the first paragraph of this point, but said goods and<br /><br />
facilities are not related, nor exclusively accessory, to the Operations, that is, they have also been used for operations in<br /><br />
other areas of the country under Hydrocarbon Exploration or Exploitation contracts still in effect, the Contractor shall<br /><br />
continue being the owner of and using said goods.<br /><br />
22.7 For purposes of the provisions set forth in point 22.6, during the last Year of the Contract Term, the Contractor shall<br /><br />
contribute and cooperate with PERUPETRO so that, without interfering with the Operations, PERUPETRO may perform<br /><br />
