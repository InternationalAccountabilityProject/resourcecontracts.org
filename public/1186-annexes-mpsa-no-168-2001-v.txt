                  the rest generate their income from fanning. Abaca and coconut are the                <br /><br /><br />

6.2.1    Potential generation of acid rock drainage                        <br /><br /><br />
The possible sources of acid rock drainage could either be the result      <br /><br /><br />
of indiscriminate and uncontrolled test pitting and drilling where         <br /><br /><br />
sulphide debris in run off water might oxidize, since acid rock            <br /><br /><br />
drainage is the result from oxidation of sulphide minerals upon            <br /><br /><br />
contact or exposure to water and air.                                      <br /><br /><br />
6.2.2    Potential siltation and pollution of surface waters               <br /><br /><br />
The possible sources of siltation and pollution of water are the           <br /><br /><br />
uncontrolled drainage from access road, drilling activities,               <br /><br /><br />
excavated materials from test pits, campsite, and indiscriminate           <br /><br /><br />
panning of heavy metals may cause water discoloration.                     <br /><br /><br />
6.2.3    Potential changes in hydrology                                    <br /><br /><br />

working area as a result of drilling and other exploration activities.     <br /><br /><br />
Potential effect of Exploration activities on the Ecology                  <br /><br /><br />
If not controlled, exploration activities including line cutting for       <br /><br /><br />
geophysical surveys, earthworks during test pitting, trenching and         <br /><br /><br />
drilling, usage of petroleum products, reagents, and personnel could       <br /><br /><br />
impact the quality of surface and ground water within and downstream       <br /><br /><br />
of the Project site. These potential impacts are:                          <br /><br /><br />
a)    Denudation with surface exposure and consequent soil erosion,        <br /><br /><br />
b)    Increased turbidity of the creeks and creek mouths and along the     <br /><br /><br />
coast due to soil erosion from the earthworks,                             <br /><br /><br />

6.4 Potential effects on the Socio-economic structures due to the presence        <br /><br /><br />
of exploration activities:                                                        <br /><br /><br />
a)    Life style of locally hired employees - most non-technical workers          <br /><br /><br />
will be hired from the locality. As such, it is expected that their               <br /><br /><br />
respective life style or mode of living will positively change or                 <br /><br /><br />
improve as a result of fix income during their period of                          <br /><br /><br />
employment.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
b)    Increase of revenue - It is expected that an increase of revenue            <br /><br /><br />
will be realized or deriving from income tax payment, payment of                  <br /><br /><br />
business permit, payment of community tax certificate of all                      <br /><br /><br />
employees, professional tax receipt, payment of SSS premium, etc.                 <br /><br /><br />
c)    Small scale buy and sell ventures in the locality will flourish due to      <br /><br /><br />
increase of demands for food supplies.                                            <br /><br /><br />

The following criteria shall be considered if there is a need to                  <br /><br /><br />
construct access road so as to minimize landform disturbance and                  <br /><br /><br />
the mitigating measures to undertake to wit:                                      <br /><br /><br />
1.    Check with local government agencies regarding                              <br /><br /><br />
resolutions, restrictions and government requirements                             <br /><br /><br />
related to access road constructions.                                             <br /><br /><br />
2.    Check surface landowner and determine vegetation, plants                    <br /><br /><br />
and other improvements.                                                           <br /><br /><br />
3.    Settle and pay disturbances compensation if any.                            <br /><br /><br />
4.    Plan and use existing trails/road to maximize advantage of                  <br /><br /><br />
usage of the trail or road for both residents and exploration                     <br /><br /><br />
activities but with minimum level of construction and                             <br /><br /><br />
disturbances. Take advantage of land form/contour                                 <br /><br /><br />
configuration and avoid vegetation disturbance if possible.                       <br /><br /><br />

                   Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) results from oxidation of sulphide                          <br /><br /><br />
                   minerals upon exposure to water and air. ARD occurs in areas                         <br /><br /><br />
                   with previous mining activities such as old adits, shafts, tunnels,                  <br /><br /><br />
                   waste rock stockpiles from underground workings and tailings.                        <br /><br /><br />
                   The exploration activities may cause the generation of ARD                           <br /><br /><br />
                   through excavated materials from test pits, trenches or core                         <br /><br /><br />
                   material from drill holes.                                                           <br /><br /><br />
                   To prevent occurrence of ARD from stockpiled materials, proper                       <br /><br /><br />
                   drainage will be constructed, surrounding the stockpile in such                      <br /><br /><br />
                   manner, that water will not accumulate around the base of stockpile                  <br /><br /><br />
                   and dry vicinity can be guaranteed.                                                  <br /><br /><br />

 a)    Drill hole collars will be plugged with concrete cement so                                      <br /><br /><br />
 that no run off or rainwater can enter the drill hole.                                                <br /><br /><br />

 empty bottle tied to a string can be used to get water inside                                         <br /><br /><br />

 However, based on experiences, sulphides are mostly deep-seated,                                      <br /><br /><br />
 thus, it is not encountered in shallow excavations, hence, the                                        <br /><br /><br />
 possibility of acidic rock drainage occurrence at excavations sites                                   <br /><br /><br />
