soil strata therewith, and that such disturbance and                                           <br /><br /><br />
intermixing is a necessary incident to the alluvial mining                                     <br /><br /><br />
of titanium-bearing and associated minerals.                                                   <br /><br /><br />
Accordingly, it is agreed that such disturbance and                                            <br /><br /><br />

           To minimize such disturbances, the Company agrees                  <br /><br /><br />

           the Company may enter the land, but shall not be                   <br /><br /><br />
