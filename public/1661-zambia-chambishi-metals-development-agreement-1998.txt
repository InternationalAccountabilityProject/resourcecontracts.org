<br /><br />

<br /><br />
H:\ZCCM\GCO\TRANS ACT\NDR50158.31 - 16 -(a) the Cost to Resume Operations is less than revenue from Normal Operations for the same period (the Minister will provide the Company with a copy of GRZ's projections of costs and revenues supporting such opinion); and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b) there are no other relevant and extraordinary commercial considerations that would make it economically unreasonable and uncommercial to do so.<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<br /><br />
FRAMEWORK APPROVED PROGRAMME OF OPERATIONS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cobalt Slag Smelter and Hydra-Metallurgical Plant<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Chambishi Metals PLC has bid to acquire the discard slag dumps from the Nkana smelter with a view to processing this material in order to produce finished cobalt and copper. The development plan involves reclamation of material from the slag dump via ripping and loading onto trucks. The production rate of material from the slag dump is planned at 700,000 tpa. The trucks will transport the material from Nikana to Chambishi where the material will be dumped on a stockpile to be fed into a crushing circuit to be crushed to - 10 mm. The crusher products will be blended with coal and fed into the newly constructed smelter of approximately 45 MVA.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The smelter will procure a high grade matte alloy assaying around 10% cobalt and 25% copper which will be leached in a newly constructed leach plant. The current hydro metallurgical plant will be adapted and expanded to receive and process the leach solution coming from the new mate leach section. The production from the new facility will total 4,200 tpa of cobalt and 7,700 tpa of copper. The copper circuit will be modified to produce A grade cathode while the cobalt tankhouse will be expanded to produce 6,600 tpa of cobalt including the production from toll treatment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Normal operations<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The development of the process flow sheets, detailed descriptions of what constitutes normal operations in terms of costs and production levels will be finalised and made available when the detailed design study has been completed. The programme of operations will be submitted for approval within a period of six (6) months (pursuant to Clause 2.1).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Investment commitment<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The committed capital in respect of the initial capital programs is as follows :<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Mining and transport           $ 1 million<br /><br />
Material Handling              $ 2 million<br /><br />
Crushing                       $ 3 million<br /><br />
Smelter and ancillaries        $ 30 million<br /><br />
Discard facilities             $ 2 million<br /><br />
Leach section                  $ 6 million<br /><br />
Plant Reconditioning           $ 14 million<br /><br />
Cobalt tank house expansion    $ 7 million<br /><br />
Copper tank house expansion    $ 5 million<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Total committed capital         $ 70 million<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Timetable<br /><br />
<br /><br />
H:\ZCCM\GCO\TRANSACT\NDR$01$8.31   -45-The realistic timetable for bringing the smelter into production, commencing from the date of completion, is approximately as follows:<br /><br />
Detailed design of smelter and hydro-metallurgical facility additions  4 months<br /><br />
Preparation of tender documents, submission of tenders and adjudication  2 months<br /><br />
Constructions of smelter and additions to hydro-metallurgical facilities  22 months<br /><br />
Commissioning  3 months<br /><br />
Total time from Completion  31 months<br /><br />
The project has a life of approximately thirty (30) years.<br /><br />
Contingent commitment<br /><br />
Nature of contingency<br /><br />
If, in the sole discretion of Chamibishi Metals PLC, certain technical commercial and economic criteria (including without limitation, the possible impact thereof of a possible Konkola North mine are satisfied), Chambishi Metals PLC will undertake a further capital programme, for the construction of a second smelter and a further expansion of the hydro-metallurgical plant. The anticipated capital in respect of this programme is: <br /><br />
Allocation of expenditure<br /><br />
Additional Smelter  $30 million<br /><br />
Further plant expansion  $20 million<br /><br />
Total contingent capital  $50 million<br /><br />
Toll treatment of cobalt concentrates<br /><br />
In addition to the slag treatment facility the Chambishi plants taken over by Avmin will be operated on a basis similar to the current mode of operation toll treating cobalt concentrates supplied by Nchanga, Nkana and Baluba. Chambishi Metals PLC will act as the coordinator of the distribution of the cobalt concentrates and pyrite between the two cobalt plants on the Copperbelt.<br /><br />
Under the toll treatment agreements concluded as part of this transaction the plant will continue to output cobalt at a rate of approximately 2,400 tpa copper at a rate of 15,000 tpa and acid at 60,000 tpa (dependent on concentrate availability). The surplus acid of about 40,000 tpa will be available for sale to ACo. <br /><br />
-46-SCHEDULE 2<br /><br />
LOCAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME<br /><br />
Chambishi Metals PLC believes that Zambian, and specifically Copperbelt, industry and business will benefit from the continued operation of the Chambishi Colbalt and Acid Plants and from the construction of the slag smelter. It believed that the company will benefit from the presence of strong local business and will facilitate its further development and growth.<br /><br />
In order to achieve this, Chambishi Metals PLC will initiate a plan that will provide an impetus for the development of local business. The broad strategy to achieve this will be as follows: <br /><br />
 Identification of business opportunities/mines outsourcing<br /><br />
 >The company will identify areas of operation which are not part of its core business or which it does not want to carry out. These areas will be designated for outsourcing.<br /><br />
 Identification of existing entrpreneurs in the area<br /><br />
 >Local businessmen and entrepreneurs who will be able to provide these services to the mines will be identified. Should there be no-one who can do so, the company will use its best endeavours to foster partnerships between foreign businesses who can provide these services and local businessmen who are interested in participating in these areas. <br /><br />
 Identification of training/skills required.<br /><br />
This will initially be focused on the formal sectors of the economy through a programme of:<br /><br />
 Wherever possible utilising local business in the capital expansion and maintenance programme.<br /><br />
 Encouraging contractors to do likewise.<br /><br />
The company will investigate mechanisms to:<br /><br />
 >Assist Zambian citizens to effectively service the company through the provision of materials, equipment and services.<br /><br />
 >Advise and assist the establishment of long term business enterprises.<br /><br />
 >Maintain a register of Zambian businesses in terms of the provision of above-mentioned services to allow for the easier identification of potential providers.<br /><br />
Chambishi Metals PLC has designated Messrs R Duvel and M Uys of Avmin to be the responsible persons to facilitate the success of the Local Business Development Plan. At a later stage this role will be fulfilled by a company employee.<br /><br />

MEDICAL SERVICES<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. MEDICAL SERVICES IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO COMPLETION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Chambishi cobalt & Acid Plant operates under the Nkana Division of ZCCM which administers two hospitals both of which are based in Kitwe.

The three hospitals thus made up the medical services which catered for all ZCCM employees based in Kitwe, Kalulushi and Chambishi. Employees of ZCCM had a choice of three hospitals depending on where they lived. The hospitals are supplemented by clinics based in the townships in the three towns as well as clinics in the plant and works areas at Chambishi.<br /><br />

Both clinics are run and maintained by ZCCM on a 24 hour service. They are staffed by ZCCM employees and are visited three days a week by doctors from Nkana hospital or, by arrangement, from kalulushi hospital.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All employees of Chambishi Cobalt & Acid Plant and their registered dependants are entitled to free medical services and to atttend hospital at kalulushi, and in some cases, Nkana.

SCHEDULE 5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
FRAMEWORK ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This document is intended to form the framework Environmental Plan referred to in Clause 12.3(b)(ii) of the Development Agreement and sets out the Company’s environmental policies and broad outline plans.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The plan is subject to changes arising from a base-line study of the operations and will be replaced by a more detailed plan in accordance with the timetable below and when agreed in accordance with Clause 12.1 of the Development Agreement. The company will be responsible for meeting the terms and conditions specified in the Environmental Plan and the Environmental Licences. Terms and conditions of existing permits and licenses will be adhered with the terms of the Environmental Plan. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is envisaged that the Environmental Plan will cover the following aspects:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. Pollution Prevention<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Priority will be given to technological modernisation and improved process maintenance, monitoring and control to complement conventional pollution control systems for atmospheric emissions and effluent discharges. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
This approach will: <br /><br />
<br /><br />
-	Reduce the volume of water requiring treatment by increased recycling of process water and minimize the use of fresh water. This will improve the efficiency of metals and solids removal in effluent treatment systems; and <br /><br />
<br /><br />
-	minimise process upset conditions and spills to the environment. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. Reduction of Risks<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Incidents of inadvertent releases will be minimised by an improved capacity for the containment of untreated water and reduced external storage of sludges and residues. The implementation of spill prevention plans will further reduce risks. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. Reduction of Environmental Impacts<br /><br />
Treated water discharges into the environment will be consolidated into one stream for Operations, wherever possible. This will result in improved treatment efficiency and will reduce stress on the number of streams currently receiving untreated or partially treated water.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4. Conducting Progressive Rehabilitation<br /><br />
Where appropriate, progressive rehabilitation will be exercised over the operating life of facilities when area become inaction and plant units redundant. <br /><br />
<br /><br />
-70-<br /><br />
H:\ZCCM\GCO\TRANS ACT\NDR$01$8.31General housekeeping improvements within the plant site are part of the process capital investment programme. This includes appropriate storage for concentrates, residues, full and empty barrels containing chemicals, sludges, and so forth. <br /><br />
5. Achieving Production Efficiency<br /><br />
A fundamental objective for the Company will be to achieve production efficiency. High losses of metals through discharges of concentrates and process solutions present an unacceptable economic cost and environmental effects. Optimising process and production efficiency will have a favourable environmental benefit. <br /><br />
6. Protection of Human Health<br /><br />
The company commits to a modernisation program at Chambishi that will reduce emissions, discharges and releases into the environment and address, inter alia, the issue of the protection of human health. Major environmental capital expenditures as contemplated in the Development Agreement will be required to bring these operations to an acceptable standard.<br /><br />
7. Phased Compliance <br /><br />
The final Environmental Plan will describe the Company’s commitment to bring the environmental performance of the Chambishi operation into compliance, over time, with the Environmental Laws. This technological modernisation programme is expected to be completed within 31 months of Completion. <br /><br />
Area of non-compliance will be discussed and agreed to with GRZ. The time required to bring each process into compliance will be detailed in the final Environmental Plan. Meeting these time schedules, within the 31 month completion period, will guarantee the maintenance of the indemnification. <br /><br />
8. Smelter Operation<br /><br />
Environmental planning for the smelter will not include any aspect of indemnification. <br /><br />
Timetable | Date<br /><br />
Production of the Baseline Study | 12 months from the date hereof<br /><br />
Production of the Environmental Plan | 18 months from the date hereof<br /><br />
-71-SCHEDULE 6<br /><br />
TRAINING AND HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME<br /><br />
In the operation of the Chambishi Cobalt and Acid Plants, Chambishi Metals PLC will focus extensively on the training and development of its employees. As is practice on Avmin’s other operations, the company will ensure that technical excellence is part of each employee’s make-up. The company’s approach will be a pragmatic bottom-up developmental approach to human resource development, with selective initiatives to accelerate the development of managers.<br /><br />
The company will develop and empower current employees to make the best use of the opportunities for advancement. Merit alone will guide the selection criteria for filling vacancies and will not be limited to academic qualification, but will include informal qualifications and work experience. The criteria will be set at appropriate levels to avoid excluding employees from training and development.<br /><br />
In the interim, the company will provide on-the-job training to enhance existing skills. Ongoing safety training will be an important part of this process. It is planned to provide opportunities to appropriate employees to develop and grow through rotational training at other Avmin operations in Africa. <br /><br />
During the planning and construction stage of the new plant, the company will provide the employees with the new skills required to effectively manage the new technology. Also this period will be used to evaluate and effect organisational re-engineering to set in place the most effective and efficient organisational structure required by the new company. <br /><br />
Chambishi Metals PLC believes that it is in its best interest to maintain a high level of Zambian employment and will endeavour to attract qualified and experienced Zambians. Recruitment will not be limited to the Republic of Zambia but will also concentrate on attracting Zambians back to the Copperbelt from other parts of Africa and the rest of the world.<br /><br />
Chambishi Metals PLC has designated Mr R Duvel of Avmin to be the responsible person to take an active role in facilitating the success of the Training and Human Resource Development Plan. At a later stage, a company employee will be identified to fulfil this role. <br /><br />
The company will carry out a detailed evaluation of current employees in order to determine their current capacity and future potential. This evaluation will enable a detailed employee-specific training and development matrix to be developed. Chambishi Metals PLC will submit a detailed Training and Human Resource Development Plan within 12 months of Completion. <br /><br />
