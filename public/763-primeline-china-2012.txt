commercial, such Crude Oil bearing trap may, at the Contractor’s option, be             <br /><br /><br />
retained within the Contract Area during the term of the exploration period;            <br /><br /><br />
before the expiration of the exploration period, if, because of certain positive        <br /><br /><br />
factors, JMC considers unanimously that it is necessary to reappraise the               <br /><br /><br />
commerciality of the Crude Oil bearing trap, the Operator shall submit a further        <br /><br /><br />
appraisal report on such Crude Oil bearing trap to JMC for its review and               <br /><br /><br />
adoption; if the JMC’s determination of non-commerciality of such Crude Oil             <br /><br /><br />
bearing trap has not altered by the expiration of the exploration period, the           <br /><br /><br />
relevant area of such Crude Oil bearing trap shall be excluded from the Contract        <br /><br /><br />
Area.                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

trap, the Parties shall make their best efforts to seek another solution thereto.       <br /><br /><br />
However, if JMC can not reach an agreement on the commerciality of any Crude            <br /><br /><br />
Oil bearing trap within ninety (90) days following the submission of the appraisal      <br /><br /><br />
report prepared by the Operator in accordance with Article 11.3 herein or any           <br /><br /><br />
further appraisal report prepared by the Operator in accordance with Article 11.5       <br /><br /><br />
herein, then such trap shall be dealt with in accordance with the following             <br /><br /><br />
procedure:                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
11.6.1 If the Contractor informs CNOOC by notice that it considers a Crude Oil          <br /><br /><br />
bearing trap without commercial value, then the Contractor shall be                     <br /><br /><br />
deemed to have waived its rights to participate in the development of that              <br /><br /><br />
Crude Oil bearing trap. The relevant area covered by that Crude Oil                     <br /><br /><br />
bearing trap shall, however, be retained within the Contract Area until the             <br /><br /><br />
expiration of the exploration period. In case that CNOOC decides, within                <br /><br /><br />
the exploration period, to develop solely such Oil Field, then, within the              <br /><br /><br />
development period, the Contractor shall be allowed to participate in the               <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                        <br /><br /><br />

the said Oil Field, to participate in the development of such Oil Field by         <br /><br /><br />
giving a written notice to CNOOC, then, the Contractor shall pay CNOOC             <br /><br /><br />
an amount of money, in addition to the forty-nine percent (49%) of the             <br /><br /><br />
development costs spent by CNOOC on the said Oil Field with Deemed                 <br /><br /><br />
Interest thereon up to the date of Contractor’s submission of the written          <br /><br /><br />
notice to CNOOC. Such amount shall be equal to three times (300%) the              <br /><br /><br />
foregoing payable development costs with Deemed Interest thereon and               <br /><br /><br />
such amount of money shall not be recovered after commercial production            <br /><br /><br />
of the Oil Field commences. Thereafter, the development costs to be                <br /><br /><br />
incurred in such Oil Field shall be provided by the Parties in proportion to       <br /><br /><br />
their respective participating interests. In the event that the Contractor still   <br /><br /><br />
decides not to participate in the development of the said Oil Field by the         <br /><br /><br />
expiration of the development period of such Oil Field, then the said Oil          <br /><br /><br />
Field shall be excluded from the Contract Area upon the Date of                    <br /><br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production of the said Oil Field.                       <br /><br /><br />
11.6.2    If CNOOC considers a Crude Oil bearing trap to have no commercial        <br /><br /><br />
value while the Contractor considers that it is a Crude Oil bearing trap           <br /><br /><br />
having commercial value, the Contractor may solely provide the entire              <br /><br /><br />
development costs and undertake development of the said Oil Field, and             <br /><br /><br />
the said Oil Field shall be deemed as an Oil Field in which CNOOC has no           <br /><br /><br />
participating interests. The entire risk related to the development costs          <br /><br /><br />
spent for the said Oil Field shall be borne solely by the Contractor.              <br /><br /><br />
11.6.3    Unless otherwise decided by CNOOC, the Development Operations and        <br /><br /><br />
Production Operations of an Oil Field solely financed for the development          <br /><br /><br />
by CNOOC shall still be, upon agreement between the Parties through                <br /><br /><br />
consultation, performed by the Operator subject to the agreement of terms          <br /><br /><br />
and conditions entered into by CNOOC and the Operator.                             <br /><br /><br />

﻿11.7    In the event of an Oil Field and/or Gas Field Straddling a Boundary, CNOOC           <br /><br /><br />
shall arrange for the Contractor and the neighbouring parties involved to work out           <br /><br /><br />
a unitized Overall Development Program for such Field and to negotiate the                   <br /><br /><br />
relevant provisions thereof.                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
11.8    If a Petroleum-bearing trap without commercial value within the Contract Area        <br /><br /><br />
can be most economically developed as a commercial Oil Field and/or Gas Field                <br /><br /><br />
by linking it up with facilities located outside the Contract Area, then the                 <br /><br /><br />
development of such Field shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided in              <br /><br /><br />
Article 11.7 herein.                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
11.9    The procedures specified in this Article 11 shall be applied, by analogy, to         <br /><br /><br />
determination of additional development projects in any Oil Field and/or Gas                 <br /><br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area during the production period, such projects being             <br /><br /><br />

11.10    If an appraisal trial production or temporary trial production is deemed by the     <br /><br /><br />
Parties to be necessary with respect to any trap in which Petroleum is discovered            <br /><br /><br />
or any Oil Field and/or Gas Field within the Contract Area, the Parties shall reach          <br /><br /><br />

(B) In the event there are no such Third Party sales of the Crude   <br /><br /><br />
Oil during the said month, then the Crude Oil price for the         <br /><br /><br />
said month shall be equal to the same Crude Oil price of the        <br /><br /><br />
preceding month adjusted by the differences in the                  <br /><br /><br />
individual arithmetic average of the daily weighted average         <br /><br /><br />
of the official government selling price of a basket of three       <br /><br /><br />
or more internationally traded Crude Oils in the said month         <br /><br /><br />

preceding month. The adjusted price shall be the Crude Oil          <br /><br /><br />
price for the said month. The Crude Oils selected for the           <br /><br /><br />
basket shall each be similar in quality to that from the            <br /><br /><br />
Contract Area and chosen from different countries and shall         <br /><br /><br />
reflect the conditions of the main world oil markets and            <br /><br /><br />

﻿Gas in any Oil Field after utilization pursuant to Article 18.1.1 herein          <br /><br /><br />
(hereafter referred to as “excess Associated Natural Gas”), the Operator          <br /><br /><br />
shall carry out a feasibility study regarding the utilization of such excess      <br /><br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of such Oil Field. Such feasibility study, if carried      <br /><br /><br />
out before the Development Operations of an Oil Field, shall be included          <br /><br /><br />
as part of the feasibility study on the development of the Oil Field. With        <br /><br /><br />
respect to any Oil Field already under commercial production, if a further        <br /><br /><br />
feasibility study on the utilization of its excess Associated Natural Gas is      <br /><br /><br />
required, such study shall be carried out by the Operator and a report            <br /><br /><br />
thereon shall be submitted to JMC for review and discussion. If the Parties       <br /><br /><br />
decide to utilize the excess Associated Natural Gas of any Oil Field, the         <br /><br /><br />
construction of facilities for such utilization and the production of the         <br /><br /><br />
excess Associated Natural Gas shall be carried out at the same time as the        <br /><br /><br />
Oil Field construction and production.                                            <br /><br /><br />

18.1.2.1    If the Parties agree that the excess Associated Natural Gas of an     <br /><br /><br />
Oil Field has no commercial value, then such gas shall be                         <br /><br /><br />
disposed of by the Operator, provided that there is no                            <br /><br /><br />

18.1.2.2    If any party to the Contract considers unilaterally that the excess   <br /><br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of an Oil Field has commercial value,                      <br /><br /><br />
such gas may be utilized by that party to the Contract at its own                 <br /><br /><br />
expense without affecting the amount of “cost recovery oil” and                   <br /><br /><br />

18.2.2 After completion of evaluation of a Gas Field, the Operator shall submit a   <br /><br /><br />
report thereon to JMC for review and discussion.                                    <br /><br /><br />
18.2.2.1 If JMC decides unanimously that a gas reservoir is non¬                    <br /><br /><br />
commercial, the corresponding area covered by the gas reservoir                     <br /><br /><br />
may be retained in the Contract Area during the exploration                         <br /><br /><br />
period. But if, at the expiration of the exploration period, JMC                    <br /><br /><br />
still considers the said gas reservoir to be non-commercial, the                    <br /><br /><br />
area covered by the gas reservoir shall be excluded from the                        <br /><br /><br />
Contract Area. For a Gas Field which has potential commercial                       <br /><br /><br />
value but which has not been developed due to a lack of market                      <br /><br /><br />
or a shortage of consuming facilities, the period for which the                     <br /><br /><br />

 18.2.2.2    If the Contractor considers any gas reservoir to be non¬                 <br /><br /><br />
 commercial, the Contractor shall he deemed to have waived its                        <br /><br /><br />
 rights of participating in the development of that gas reservoir.                    <br /><br /><br />
 18.2.2.3    Where the Parties consider a gas reservoir to be commercial, the         <br /><br /><br />
