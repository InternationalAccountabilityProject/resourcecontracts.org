dollars (US$ --,000,000).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Should any well forming part of the Exploration work commitment provided<br /><br />
for in Articles 4.3 and 4.4 be abandoned, for any reason other than a reason<br /><br />
specified in Article 4.6 below, before reaching the defined objectives of such<br /><br />
well, the Concessionaire shall drill a substitute well. In this event the relevant<br /><br />
Exploration Period shall be extended by a reasonable period of time as<br /><br />
MIREM may agree to allow the drilling and evaluation of the substitute well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise approved by MIREM, any well which forms part of the<br /><br />
Exploration work commitment provided for in Articles 4.3 and 4.4 shall be<br /><br />
drilled to such depth as set forth in those articles, unless before reaching the<br /><br />
required depth:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
further drilling would in the reasonable opinion of the Concessionaire<br /><br />
present an obvious danger, due to such events as, but not limited to, the<br /><br />
presence of abnormal pressure or excessive losses of drilling mud;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
impenetrable formations are encountered;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Petroleum bearing formations are encountered which require<br /><br />
protecting, thereby preventing planned depths from being reached; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MIREM agrees to terminate the drilling operation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In circumstances that the drilling of any well is drilled for the purpose of<br /><br />
Article 4.6 it may be terminated at a lesser depth and shall be deemed to have<br /><br />
satisfied all the Concessionaire’s obligations in respect of that well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the drilling of Exploration Wells hereunder, the Concessionaire shall,<br /><br />
in accordance with applicable law, keep MIREM informed of the progress of<br /><br />
each well and shall:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
as soon as reasonably possible, consult with MIREM regarding any<br /><br />
proposed well testing programme;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
test potentially commercially viable horizons within the EPC Area<br /><br />
indicated by wireline logging or by other means of formation<br /><br />
evaluation; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
promptly undertake a technical evaluation of the said test results and of<br /><br />
all other relevant subsurface data and submit the same to MIREM as<br /><br />
soon as it has been completed.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Minimum Expenditure obligations set forth in Articles 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4<br /><br />
shall not in respect of any period be satisfied unless the total Attributable<br /><br />
Expenditure for that period equals or exceeds the amount of the Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure for that period; provided, however, that if, at the end of any<br /><br />
Exploration Period, the work commitment for that period has been completed<br /><br />
to the reasonable satisfaction of MIREM, the expenditure incurred by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during that period shall be deemed to equal or exceed the<br /><br />
Minimum Expenditure for that period specified in Articles 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 .<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.10(a) Minimum Expenditure guarantee<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the joint and several liability of the Persons constituting<br /><br />
the Concessionaire, each of the Persons constituting the Concessionaire shall<br /><br />
by no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, and where this<br /><br />
14<br /><br />
<br /><br />
EPC has been extended pursuant to Article 3.3, on the first day of each such<br /><br />
extension period, provide, in substantially the form shown in Annex “D” an<br /><br />
unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee in respect of its share of the<br /><br />
Minimum Expenditure for the initial Exploration Period, or, as the case may<br /><br />
be the Minimum Expenditure obligations for any further Exploration<br /><br />
Periods, as the same may have been reduced by the provisions of Article<br /><br />
4.11. For the purpose of this Article 4.10(a), where a Person constituting the<br /><br />
Concessionaire has undertaken to fund payments in respect of Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure which would otherwise have been payable by another Person<br /><br />
constituting the Concessionaire, the share of Minimum Expenditure of that<br /><br />
Person constituting the Concessionaire giving that undertaking will be<br /><br />
deemed to include the share of Minimum Expenditure for which such other<br /><br />
Person constituting the Concessionaire would have been liable if no such<br /><br />
undertaking had been given.<br /><br />
4.10(b) Parent Company guarantee<br /><br />
Without prejudice to the joint and several liability of the Persons constituting<br /><br />
the Concessionaire, each of the Persons constituting the Concessionaire shall<br /><br />
by no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date provide, in<br /><br />
substantially the form shown in Annex “E” an unconditional and irrevocable<br /><br />
parent company guarantee from an entity acceptable to MIREM in respect of<br /><br />
all its obligations under this EPC beyond the scope of the Minimum<br /><br />
Expenditure guarantee.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The amount of any bank guarantee given pursuant to applicable law or Article<br /><br />
4.10 shall be reduced at the end of every calendar quarter by an amount equal<br /><br />
to the Attributable Expenditure incurred by the Concessionaire during that<br /><br />
quarter in discharge of its obligations under Articles 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.12<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If, at the end of the initial Exploration Period or at the end of any Exploration<br /><br />
Period, the Attributable Expenditure incurred by the Concessionaire during<br /><br />
that period does not and is not, pursuant to Article 4.9, deemed to equal or<br /><br />
15<br /><br />
<br /><br />
exceed the Minimum Expenditure for that period, MIREM shall notify the<br /><br />
Concessionaire and shall, unless the full amount of the shortfall has been met<br /><br />
by the Concessionaire within fourteen (14) days of such notification, have the<br /><br />
right to call on said guarantee for the payment thereunder to MIREM of the<br /><br />
full amount of the shortfall.<br /><br />
4.13<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event where the number of Exploration Wells drilled by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during any Exploration Period exceed the number of wells<br /><br />
provided for in the work commitment for that period, as specified in Articles<br /><br />
4.2 and 4.3, the number of additional Exploration Wells drilled by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during such Exploration Period may be carried forward and<br /><br />
treated as work undertaken in discharge of the Concessionaire’s commitment<br /><br />
to drill Exploration Wells during the succeeding period; provided, however, if<br /><br />
by reason of the provisions of this article the work commitment of the<br /><br />
Concessionaire for any period as specified in Articles 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 have<br /><br />
been fully discharged by the Concessionaire before that period commences,<br /><br />
the Concessionaire, after consultation with MIREM, shall adopt a work<br /><br />
commitment for the period in question so as to ensure the continuity of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in, or in connection with, the EPC Area during that<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.14<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Otherwise than as provided in such articles, nothing in Articles 4.12 or<br /><br />
clause 4.13 shall be read or construed as extinguishing, postponing or<br /><br />
modifying any commitment of the Concessionaire to carry out seismic surveys<br /><br />
or to drill Exploration Wells pursuant to this Article.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.15<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Neither the Appraisal Wells nor seismic surveys carried out pursuant to an<br /><br />
Appraisal Programme drawn up pursuant to Article 6.2 nor the expenditure<br /><br />
incurred by the Concessionaire in carrying out such Appraisal Programme<br /><br />
shall be treated as discharging in whole or in part the Minimum Expenditure<br /><br />
obligations set out in Articles 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.16<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within forty five (45) days of the Effective Date and thereafter, for so long as<br /><br />
an Exploration Period subsists and at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of<br /><br />
16<br /><br />
<br /><br />
each calendar year or at such other times as may be approved in advance by<br /><br />
MIREM, the Concessionaire shall prepare in reasonable detail and submit to<br /><br />
MIREM an Exploration work programme and budget for the remaining<br /><br />
portion of the calendar year or, for the subsequent calendar year, and a<br /><br />
proposed structure for the Concessionaire’s organisation for the conduct of<br /><br />
Exploration Operations in the EPC Area.<br /><br />
4.17<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Exploration work programme and budget prepared by the Concessionaire<br /><br />
shall be consistent with obligations under this article and shall set forth the<br /><br />
Exploration Operations which the Concessionaire proposes to carry out during<br /><br />
the remaining portion of the calendar year or, in the case of the programme<br /><br />
and budget for subsequent years, during the following calendar year. The<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall consider any recommendations made by MIREM in<br /><br />
respect thereof and after making such revisions thereto as the Concessionaire<br /><br />
considers appropriate submit the Exploration work programme and budget to<br /><br />
MIREM for information.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.18<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Concessionaire may at any time amend the Exploration work programme<br /><br />
and budget submitted in accordance with Article 4.16, provided that the<br /><br />
amended Exploration work programme and budget are:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
prepared in reasonable detail and submitted to MIREM, whose<br /><br />
recommendations in respect thereof shall be considered by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
consistent with the Concessionaire’s obligations under this Article;<br /><br />

6.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where, in the course of the Petroleum Operations, a Discovery of Petroleum is<br /><br />
made in the EPC Area, the Concessionaire shall as soon as reasonably possible<br /><br />
by notice inform MIREM whether or not, in its opinion, the said Discovery is<br /><br />
of potential commercial interest.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For a Discovery of potential commercial interest the Concessionaire shall<br /><br />
promptly prepare an Appraisal Programme and, after consultation with<br /><br />
MIREM, carry out such Appraisal Programme and submit a report of the<br /><br />
appraisal activities to MIREM within three (3) months after the completion of<br /><br />
the Appraisal Programme.<br /><br />

Article 9<br /><br />
Cost Recovery and Production Entitlement<br /><br />
9.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Concessionaire shall bear and pay all costs incurred in carrying out the<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in which the Concessionaire participates, and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall recover such costs, to the extent permitted by the<br /><br />
provisions of Annex “C” of this EPC, and shall be remunerated exclusively by<br /><br />
means of an entitlement to quantities of Petroleum to which the<br /><br />
Concessionaire is entitled as herein provided.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions related to cost recovery and profit entitlement set out in this<br /><br />
Article shall apply to Petroleum with effect that the Government and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire shall have title in undivided participating entitlement to the<br /><br />
Petroleum available for sale in any given period. Unless otherwise instructed<br /><br />
by Government the sale of such Petroleum shall take place on a joint dedicated<br /><br />
basis by the Concessionaire and the Concessionaire will hold those<br /><br />
entitlements in undivided proportions equal to the proportions in which during<br /><br />
that period each Party was entitled to Disposable Petroleum. Such instructions<br /><br />
shall not affect volumes of Petroleum subject to contract. Accordingly, the<br /><br />
proceeds from the sale on a joint dedicated basis of Petroleum in any given<br /><br />
period shall be divided between the Government and the Concessionaire in the<br /><br />
proportions in which they had title in undivided entitlements to the Petroleum<br /><br />
sold.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From the total quantity of Petroleum Produced, the Concessionaire may take a<br /><br />
portion thereof necessary to discharge the Concessionaire’s obligation for the<br /><br />
Petroleum Production Tax. The balance of Petroleum remaining after the<br /><br />
aforesaid portion has been set aside is hereinafter referred to as “Disposable<br /><br />
Petroleum”.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For purposes of the R-factor calculation, Disposable Petroleum and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Petroleum shall be calculated in respect of the whole of the EPC Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Insofar as permitted by applicable law and this EPC, all costs incurred<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by the Concessionaire in relation to Petroleum Operations, shall be recovered<br /><br />
from Disposable Petroleum, as available at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In addition, and in the event the Government and/or the Concessionaire<br /><br />
<br /><br />
elect to take Profit Petroleum in kind, the Concessionaire shall, for accounting<br /><br />
and reporting purposes, record Cost Petroleum separately:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
in respect of each Development and Production Area, and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii) in the form of liquids and gas, on a pro-rata basis relative to the<br /><br />
volumes of Petroleum Produced.<br /><br />
Condensate shall be taken in liquids or gas on the basis of its character at the<br /><br />
Delivery Point.<br /><br />
9.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For each calendar year, all Recoverable Costs incurred by the Concessionaire<br /><br />
in relation to Petroleum Operations in the EPC Area shall be limited to --------percent (--- %) of Disposable Petroleum.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Cost Petroleum for any quarter calculated in the manner aforesaid shall be<br /><br />
increased by:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the amount of any contributions made by the Concessionaire into the<br /><br />
Decommissioning Fund during such quarter; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the costs incurred by the Concessionaire during such quarter to<br /><br />
implement an approved Decommissioning Plan prepared pursuant to<br /><br />
applicable law and the provisions of Article 15 save to the extent that,<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
<br /><br />
costs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
have<br /><br />
<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
<br /><br />
funded<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by<br /><br />

from<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning Fund; and<br /><br />

Valuation of Petroleum<br /><br />
10.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The value of Petroleum referred to in Articles 9 and 11 shall, to the<br /><br />
extent such Petroleum consists of Crude Oil, be determined at the end<br /><br />
of each calendar month commencing with the calendar month in which<br /><br />
Commercial Production of Crude Oil begins. To the extent such<br /><br />
Petroleum consists of Natural Gas it shall be determined at the end of<br /><br />
each calendar month commencing in which commercial delivery at the<br /><br />
Delivery Point begins.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A value for each separate export grade of Crude Oil will be:<br /><br />
(a) in the case of sales to non-Affiliated Companies, the weighted<br /><br />
average price per barrel at the Delivery Point of each separate<br /><br />
export grade of Crude Oil being the prices FOB within the meaning<br /><br />
defined in Incoterms 2000, at which such Crude Oil has been sold<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Concessionaire<br /><br />
<br /><br />
during<br /><br />
<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
<br /><br />
calendar<br /><br />
<br /><br />
month;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b) If the Concessionaire sells the Crude Oil to a third party on terms<br /><br />
different from FOB (as per Incoterms 2000), then for the purpose<br /><br />
of this EPC, a calculated net-back FOB price shall be applied. The<br /><br />
net-back FOB price shall be established by deducting from the<br /><br />
price agreed the actual and direct costs incurred by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire in fulfilling the obligations under their sales<br /><br />
contract additional to those obligations included under a FOB<br /><br />
contract.<br /><br />
(c) in the case of sales to Affiliated Companies, such price as agreed<br /><br />
between MIREM and the Concessionaire on the basis of adding the<br /><br />
following two factors together:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the weighted average calendar month FOB price for<br /><br />
Brent rated Crude Oil, or such other appropriate marker<br /><br />
32<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Crude Oil for the production in question for the period<br /><br />
in question. The weighted average will be based on the<br /><br />
days in each calendar month when a closing price is<br /><br />
reported in Platts Oilgram price report. Days such as<br /><br />
weekends and holidays with no price reports will be<br /><br />
ignored;<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a premium or discount to the price of the Brent rated<br /><br />
Crude Oil, or such other appropriate marker Crude Oil<br /><br />
for the production in question to be determined by<br /><br />
reference to the quality of the Crude Oil produced from<br /><br />
the EPC Area and the cost of moving such Crude Oil to<br /><br />
the market.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In any case in which MIREM and the Concessionaire are unable to agree a<br /><br />
price under Article 10.2 (c), in order to determine the premium or discount<br /><br />
referred to therein the following procedures shall be undertaken:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MIREM and the Concessionaire shall submit to each other their<br /><br />
assessments of the premium or discount together with an explanation<br /><br />
of the key factors taken into consideration in assessing the premium or<br /><br />
discount;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if the premium or discount submitted by each of MIREM and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire are within ten United States Cents (10 US ¢) per barrel<br /><br />
of each other the average will be taken for the purposes of setting the<br /><br />
final value of the Crude Oil;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if the premium or discount submitted by each of MIREM and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire differ by more than ten United States Cents (10 US ¢)<br /><br />
per barrel each will resubmit a revised premium or discount to the<br /><br />
other on the third (3rd) business day after the first exchange of<br /><br />
information;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
33<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if the premium or discount submitted by each of MIREM and the<br /><br />
Concessionaire on the second exchange of information are within ten<br /><br />
United States Cents (10 US ¢) per barrel of each other the average will<br /><br />
be taken for the purposes of setting the final value of Crude Oil;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if the premium or discount submitted on the second exchange of<br /><br />
information differ by more than ten United States Cents (10 US ¢) per<br /><br />
barrel the matter shall, in accordance with Article 30.6, be referred for<br /><br />
determination by a sole expert who shall establish a price based on the<br /><br />
criteria set out in Article 10.2(c) but always within the range<br /><br />
established<br /><br />

<br /><br />
in the case of sales to non-Affiliated Companies, the weighted average<br /><br />
price per Gigajoule of commercial specification Natural Gas at the<br /><br />
Delivery Point at which such Natural Gas has been delivered by the<br /><br />
Concessionaire during that calendar month, shall be the weighted<br /><br />
average price per Gigajoule of all other commercial specification<br /><br />
Natural Gas delivered during the same calendar month from reservoirs<br /><br />
subject to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Mozambique and the<br /><br />
weighted average of posted or publicly available prices for alternative<br /><br />
fuels to Natural Gas for large scale industrial consumers including<br /><br />
power generators in the market where such has been delivered to<br /><br />
ultimate customers.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
in the case of sales to Affiliated Companies, such price as stipulated in<br /><br />
sub-paragraph a) above for sales to non-Affiliated Companies or such<br /><br />
price agreed between MIREM and the Concessionaire.<br /><br />
