including by way of security, pledged or transferred, in whole or in part, by GEOVIC to any<br /><br />
Lender or other creditor, as well as to its successors and assignees. Any assignment,<br /><br />
realization of a pledge or transfer of rights arising under this Convention shall automatically<br /><br />
entail, unless otherwise provided by the assignment, pledge or transfer deed, the transfer of<br /><br />
constructions, structures and facilities of any kind belonging to GEOVIC as well as of the<br /><br />
benefit of the granting of rights of access to lands as defined in the Mining Code, and the<br /><br />
terms of the present Convention. Except for constructions, structures and facilities of any<br /><br />
kind belonging to GEOVIC which may not be the object of a mortgage or other security, nor<br /><br />
of any attachment or legal process, GEOVIC may grant any security, including transfer by<br /><br />
way of security, over its other property or assets, including its goodwill, its intellectual<br /><br />

With effect from the date of entry into force of such substitution, the Substituted<br /><br />

GEOVIC by this Convention. However and notwithstanding the foregoing, no Substituted<br /><br />
Entity shall have the right to agree to amendments or modifications of this Convention.<br /><br />
Such substitutions shall entail the vesting in the Substituted Entity of the said rights<br /><br />
and obligations as well as GEOVIC’s rights in constructions, structures and facilities of any<br /><br />
kind and the benefit of enjoyment of the rights of access to the lands, notwithstanding any act<br /><br />
or ruling of third parties to the contrary, in particular in the event of bankruptcy or court<br /><br />
liquidation of GEOVIC.<br /><br />
When the principal, interest and all other amounts due by GEOVIC under its contracts<br /><br />

GEOVIC shall resume its rights and obligations conferred by the present Convention.<br /><br />
The conditions and implementation terms of the substitution shall be defined by and<br /><br />
between the Parties and the Lender, as the case may be. The Parties shall notify the Minister<br /><br />

shall be stayed temporarily during the arbitration proceedings. If the dispute relates to<br /><br />
amounts due as Ad Valorem Tax, or an element of computation of such tax, GEOVIC shall<br /><br />
pay the uncontested portion. This suspension shall not be stayed if GEOVIC fails to pay such<br /><br />
uncontested amount, at least sixty (60) days after notice without cure.<br /><br />
25.5 If the issue that motivated the suspension of the Mining Permit has not been<br /><br />
cured after thirty (30) days, and an arbitration procedure has not been commenced, GEOVIC<br /><br />
shall be considered as not having performed its obligations under the rights conferred by the<br /><br />
Mining Permit, which shall be withdrawn, and the present Convention terminated.<br /><br />
25.6 Any notice of default given pursuant to this Article shall be cancelled<br /><br />
immediately, and any suspension that has taken effect shall be lifted, when the default has<br /><br />
been cured and any applicable penalties paid.<br /><br />

default has not been cured in the time periods provided for above, the rights and benefits<br /><br />
referred to in Article 25.2 shall be suspended for a period of no more than one hundred eighty<br /><br />
(180) days from the notification of such action to GEOVIC. Such suspension of rights and<br /><br />
benefits shall terminate prior to the expiry of the one hundred eighty (180) day period if the<br /><br />
State takes note that the default has been cured and that, where applicable, penalties provided<br /><br />
for in the present Convention have been paid. During the period of suspension of rights and<br /><br />
benefits, activities undertaken under this Convention shall proceed in accordance with its<br /><br />
terms, and with the legislation in force.<br /><br />

resolved by arbitration, or (b) the default(s) has(have) not been cured and penalties provided<br /><br />
for by this Convention have not been paid, the Mining Permit may be withdrawn and this<br /><br />
Convention terminated, with effect from the date of notification of such termination to<br /><br />
GEOVIC by the State.<br /><br />
25.9 Suspension of the rights and benefits as well as withdrawal of the Mining<br /><br />

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be expressly outlined that force majeure shall<br /><br />
be understood as all events beyond the control of GEOVIC and likely to impede either the<br /><br />
construction or the development of its mining or plant sites, or the production, transportation<br /><br />
or marketing of its products.<br /><br />
However, the technical and commercial hazards of the company, as well as the general<br /><br />
economic situation, may not be considered as cases of force majeure.<br /><br />
28.3. The Party that cannot comply with its obligations due to a Force Majeure event<br /><br />
shall notify the other Party and shall provide all the details on the Force Majeure event. In<br /><br />
all cases, the Party that is the victim of a Force Majeure event shall take all appropriate steps<br /><br />
in order to perform the obligations affected by the Force Majeure event.<br /><br />
A Force Majeure event affecting Contractors and Subcontractors shall be considered<br /><br />
as a Force Majeure event affecting GEOVIC insofar as this Force Majeure event affects<br /><br />
GEOVIC’s activities in Cameroon.<br /><br />
28.4. If, in case of Force Majeure, performance of any of the obligations provided for<br /><br />
in this Convention is suspended, the period of suspension of the obligation and the time<br /><br />
necessary for the Party that is the victim of the Force Majeure event to repair the damages<br /><br />
caused by the Force Majeure event, as well as the damages caused during this period of<br /><br />
suspension, shall be added to any time period provided by this Convention for the<br /><br />
performance of such an obligation, and any other time period in this Convention shall be<br /><br />
extended by an equal amount of time.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 29:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES<br /><br />
<br /><br />
29.1 The Parties shall agree that any dispute arising between the State and GEOVIC<br /><br />
from this Convention, including its validity, shall be the subject of attempts at amicable<br /><br />
settlement.<br /><br />
In the event of failure to reach an amicable settlement, such disputes shall be settled<br /><br />
following the arbitration procedure set forth in this article.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
<br /><br />
29.2 Any dispute as to interpretation as between the English and French versions, shall<br /><br />
be resolved pursuant to this article. However, if the parties agree that the dispute does not<br /><br />
warrant application of the full arbitration procedure, they shall designate a neutral bilingual<br /><br />
third party who is knowledgeable in the application of international contracts generally. The<br /><br />
decision of the party so designated as to the proper interpretation of the disputed clauses shall<br /><br />
be binding on the parties.<br /><br />
If the parties cannot agree on the third party to be designated, they shall agree to<br /><br />
submit an application to the International Chamber of Commerce, for the designation of such<br /><br />
third party. The parties shall agree to accept the party so designated.<br /><br />
29.3. Except as specifically stated elsewhere in this Convention, all disputes arising<br /><br />
in connection with this Convention shall be finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and<br /><br />
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) by three arbitrators appointed<br /><br />
in accordance with the said Rules (the “Rules”).<br /><br />
The Parties shall agree that any arbitration under this arbitration provision shall be an<br /><br />
international arbitration subject to the New York Convention on the Recognition and<br /><br />
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards of 1958.<br /><br />
An arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with this Convention shall be<br /><br />
composed of three (3) arbitrators selected as indicated below. The arbitrators shall have the<br /><br />
powers of compounders.<br /><br />
29.4. If a Party is of the opinion that a dispute will not be resolved amicably, it shall<br /><br />
notify the other Party of its decision to resort to arbitration by means of a Request for<br /><br />
Arbitration, notified to the other party in accordance with conditions laid down in this<br /><br />
Convention and communicated to the ICC. The Request for Arbitration shall be drafted in<br /><br />
accordance with the Rules, and shall indicate the name, qualifications and domicile of the<br /><br />
Claimant’s selected arbitrator.<br /><br />
The Defendant shall file its Answer with the ICC and shall notify it to the Claimant<br /><br />
within thirty (30) days of the Defendant’s receipt of the Request for Arbitration. The Answer<br /><br />
shall designate the Defendant’s choice of arbitrator, indicating the arbitrator’s name,<br /><br />
qualifications and domicile.<br /><br />
The two designated arbitrators shall designate the third arbitrator within thirty (30)<br /><br />
days of the receipt by the Claimant of the Defendant’s Answer. They shall jointly<br /><br />
communicate the name, qualifications and domicile of the third arbitrator to the ICC.<br /><br />
Failure to designate within a deadline of thirty(30) days with effect from the date of<br /><br />
designation of an arbitrator by either of the parties, or if the two designated arbitrators fail to<br /><br />
designate a third arbitrator, as provided above, the unnamed arbitrator(s) shall be appointed by<br /><br />
the ICC.<br /><br />
29.5. The Parties shall agree to pay advances and costs of arbitration as provided for<br /><br />
in the Rules. The Award shall allocate final responsibility for costs and fees of the arbitration.<br /><br />
29.6. The Parties’ obligations arising from this Convention shall remain in force and<br /><br />
the Parties shall not be released therefrom during the course of any arbitration proceeding,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provided, however, that the commencement of an arbitration procedure shall suspend<br /><br />
execution of the disputed measure during the course of such arbitration, unless the designated<br /><br />
arbitrators decide otherwise, at the request of one of the Parties, and as a measure to prevent<br /><br />
significant economic loss to either Party or to third parties, to protect the environment, or for<br /><br />
any reason justifying emergency measures.<br /><br />
29.7. The award rendered by the arbitration tribunal shall be final and irrevocable. It<br /><br />
shall be binding on the Parties and shall be enforceable in accordance with ICC Rules and<br /><br />
applicable laws in the Republic of Cameroon. The Parties shall renounce, formally and<br /><br />
without reservation, any right to challenge said award, to oppose its execution by any means<br /><br />
or to resort to any other jurisdiction whatsoever for resolution of the same dispute or any part<br /><br />
of it. The Republic of Cameroon, within the context of arbitration, hereby waives its right to<br /><br />
invoke immunity from execution of the arbitration award and, if necessary, from any<br /><br />
judgment for enforcement of the arbitration award.<br /><br />
29.8. If an arbitration award orders one of the Parties to pay sums of money to the<br /><br />
other Party, the Parties shall undertake to agree on the terms of payment of such amounts<br /><br />
within thirty (30) days from the date of notification of the award. The arbitration tribunal<br /><br />
shall not close its proceedings until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after notification of the<br /><br />
award, or (ii) receipt from either Party of a request that the arbitrators decide a schedule for<br /><br />
payment of any award, as an adjunct to the award, and in aid of enforcement of its award on<br /><br />
the merits.<br /><br />
If the negotiations fail, if no request is made to the arbitrators for the scheduling of<br /><br />
payments, or if an award is not satisfied in full, pursuant to an agreement of the Parties or in<br /><br />
accordance with an award in aid of enforcement, the Parties agree that the Party in whose<br /><br />
favour the award on the merits has been made shall be entitled to set off all or any part of the<br /><br />
award against any amounts owing by that Party to the other Party, including but not limited to<br /><br />
any award in favour of the other Party by the arbitration tribunal, any taxes or fees, including<br /><br />
but not limited to Ad Valorem Taxes owed by GEOVIC to the State, or any amounts owed by<br /><br />
the State to GEOVIC. Neither the rate of the Ad Valorem Tax, nor the obligation of GEOVIC<br /><br />
to pay such tax shall be affected by such setoff rights, and GEOVIC shall continue to file<br /><br />
declarations of the Ad Valorem Tax, claiming any setoff.<br /><br />
Where no setoffs are available, the Party against which an award has been rendered<br /><br />
shall make quarterly payments on the award amounting to a minimum of twenty-five percent<br /><br />
(25%) of the amount of the award, until the award is paid in full.<br /><br />
If after 12(twelve) months of the award on the merits, said award has not been paid in<br /><br />
full, if either of the Parties has breached its agreement on the schedule to pay the award, or if<br /><br />
the arbitrators’ award as to payment terms has not been complied with, the Parties shall be<br /><br />
entitled to pursue the enforcement of the arbitration award by any other means which are legal<br /><br />
in the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought, without restriction.<br /><br />
The provisions of this Article shall be enforceable in any case where an arbitration<br /><br />
award establishes that, in breach of the provisions of this Convention in respect of the stability<br /><br />
of the legal and tax regime, a legislative, administrative or regulatory measure entailing a<br /><br />
payment to the State was enforced against Third Party Beneficiaries, to the extent GEOVIC is<br /><br />
contractually bound to reimburse such payment to such Persons.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties may agree that this Article shall apply to the payment of sums of money<br /><br />
required from either Party as a result of the amicable settlement of a dispute.<br /><br />
29.9. In the event of a dispute between the State and any Third Party Beneficiary<br /><br />
arising out of this Convention, these provisions shall be applicable under the following<br /><br />
conditions: the State accepts the terms of this article pursuant to its obligations under this<br /><br />
Convention. A Third Party Beneficiary shall be deemed to have ratified this article when it i)<br /><br />
initiates arbitration by filing a Request for Arbitration or ii) agrees to arbitration by filing an<br /><br />
Answer to a demand.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 30:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PLACE AND LANGUAGE OF ARBITRATION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The arbitration shall be conducted in English or in French, or in both languages, and<br /><br />
shall take place in Paris, France. The arbitrators selected shall decide any questions as to use<br /><br />
of language during the proceedings, on the basis of fairness to the Parties and in the interest of<br /><br />
promoting the efficiency of the proceedings.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 31:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
APPLICABLE LAW<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cameroon law, the terms and conditions of this Convention, the general principles of<br /><br />
international law and common practices widely used in the international mining industry shall<br /><br />
govern this Convention. In case of conflict among these, common practices which can be<br /><br />
established as being widely used in the international mining industry shall take precedence.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 32:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ENTIRE AGREEMENT<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Convention shall set forth the entire understanding of the Parties thereto and shall<br /><br />
supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the<br /><br />
subject matter hereof. The Parties shall declare that no representation, promise, or statement<br /><br />
of intent made by either Party has been left out of this Convention. However, no Party shall<br /><br />
be bound by or be liable for any alleged representation, promise, or statement of intent not<br /><br />
embodied or incorporated herein unless same shall have been made contemporaneously<br /><br />
herewith and put in writing and signed by both Parties.<br /><br />
ARTICLE 33:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
NON-WAIVER<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The failure of either Party to insist upon strict performance by the other Party of the<br /><br />
terms and conditions of this Convention, or its failure to take the necessary measures at its<br /><br />
disposal to ensure their performance shall not be considered as a waiver of any of its rights<br /><br />
granted by this Convention. Each Party shall be under obligation to observe the covenants,<br /><br />
responsibilities, and duties imposed upon it by the terms of this Convention and its riders. The<br /><br />
Parties shall be bound to perform in strict accordance with the terms hereof, despite the<br /><br />
possible inaction of any of the Parties.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 34:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SEVERABILITY<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each and every guarantee, undertaking and agreement contained in this Convention is,<br /><br />
and shall be construed to be, a separate and independent guarantee, undertaking and<br /><br />
agreement. If any term or provision of this Convention or the application thereof to any Party<br /><br />
or in any circumstance shall to any extent be declared invalid and/or unenforceable by an<br /><br />
arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Convention, or the<br /><br />
application of such term or provision to Parties or circumstances other than those as to which<br /><br />
it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby.<br /><br />
