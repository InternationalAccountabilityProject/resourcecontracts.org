If the Appraisal of a Discovery of Non-Associated Gas demonstrates that the Discovery,              <br /><br /><br />
although substantial, is not then, either alone or in combination with other Discoveries,           <br /><br /><br />

the request of the Contractors, declare a Gas Retention Area in respect of it for that period.      <br /><br /><br />

Contractors diligently seek to make it commercially viable, and demonstrate to the Ministry         <br /><br /><br />
that they are doing so.                                                                             <br /><br /><br />

Field, plus a reserve margin sufficient to cover the probable and possible extent of it, but the    <br /><br /><br />
Ministry may exclude deeper formations in which no Discovery has been made. The                     <br /><br /><br />
Ministry, at any time and from time to time, and whether of its own volition or at the              <br /><br /><br />
request of the Contractors, may:                                                                    <br /><br /><br />

this Article 4 is abandoned for any reason other than a reason specified in paragraph 4.4(b)             <br /><br /><br />
before reaching the defined objectives of such well, the Contractors shall drill a substitute            <br /><br /><br />
well. In this event, the first, second or third Exploration period, as the case may be, shall be         <br /><br /><br />
extended by a period of time equal in length to the time spent in preparing for and drilling             <br /><br /><br />
the substitute well, including mobilisation and demobilisation of the drilling rig, if                   <br /><br /><br />
applicable.                                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
(b)    Unless otherwise agreed by the Ministry, any well which forms part of the Exploration             <br /><br /><br />
Work Programme and Budget provided for in this Article 4 shall be drilled to such depth as               <br /><br /><br />
is necessary for the evaluation of the geological formation established by the available data            <br /><br /><br />
as the target formation and which Good Oil Field Practices would require the Contractors to              <br /><br /><br />
attain, unless before reaching such depth:                                                               <br /><br /><br />
(i)    a formation stratigraphically older than the deepest target formation is encountered;             <br /><br /><br />
(ii)    basement is encountered;                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
(iii)    further drilling would present an obvious danger, such as but not limited to the                <br /><br /><br />
presence of abnormal pressure or excessive losses of drilling mud;                                       <br /><br /><br />
(iv)    impenetrable formations are encountered;                                                         <br /><br /><br />
(v)    Petroleum-bearing formations are encountered which require protecting, thereby                    <br /><br /><br />
preventing planned depths from being reached; or                                                         <br /><br /><br />
(vi)    the Contractors and the Ministry agree to terminate the drilling operation; and                  <br /><br /><br />
(vii)    the Ministry confirms that the drilling obligation has been fulfilled.                          <br /><br /><br />
In such circumstances the drilling of any such well may be terminated at a lesser depth and              <br /><br /><br />
shall be deemed to have satisfied the Contractors’ obligations in respect of that well.                  <br /><br /><br />
(c)    Where a well which forms part of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget provided               <br /><br /><br />
for in this Article 4 results in a Discovery and the Contractors inform the Ministry pursuant            <br /><br /><br />
to Section 4.9 that the Discovery merits Appraisal, that well will be deemed to have met its             <br /><br /><br />
objective and to have satisfied the Contractors’ obligations in respect of that well.                    <br /><br /><br />

under the Exploration Work Programme, the Ministry may:                                               <br /><br /><br />
(i)    terminate this Agreement and require payment by way of liquidated damages of the               <br /><br /><br />
estimated cost of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget not carried out;                          <br /><br /><br />
(ii)    require payment by way of liquidated damages of the estimated cost of the                     <br /><br /><br />

(iii)    require that the shortfall be added to the Exploration Work Programme and Budget             <br /><br /><br />

The Parties agree that the amount payable under this paragraph 4.5(a) is a reasonable                 <br /><br /><br />

the excess shall be credited against Exploration to be carried out in the following Contract          <br /><br /><br />
Year and, to the extent in excess of that Exploration, shall be further carried forward.              <br /><br /><br />

(d)    In determining whether to approve the over-expenditures contemplated at paragraphs 4.7(a)      <br /><br /><br />
and 4.7(b), the Ministry shall consider whether such increases are necessary to complete the          <br /><br /><br />
programme of works, provided that such increase is not the result of any failure of the               <br /><br /><br />
Contractors to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement.                                         <br /><br /><br />

From time to time, the Contractors may submit, for the approval of the Ministry,               <br /><br /><br />

The Contractors shall notify the Ministry of a Discovery and shall provide the Ministry with   <br /><br /><br />

At such time and in such manner as the Ministry requires, the Contractors shall submit, for    <br /><br /><br />
the approval of the Ministry, an Appraisal Work Programme and Budget for each Calendar         <br /><br /><br />

From time to time the Contractors may submit, for the approval of the Ministry,                <br /><br /><br />

An Appraisal Work Programme and Budget for a Calendar Year will be such as would be            <br /><br /><br />
undertaken by a person seeking diligently to Appraise (in accordance with this Agreement)      <br /><br /><br />

Discoveries, a Commercial Discovery.                                                           <br /><br /><br />

The Contractors may, at any time and having regard to paragraph 4.10(b), declare that a        <br /><br /><br />
Commercial Discovery has been made.                                                            <br /><br /><br />

all claims, damages, losses, penalties, costs and expenses arising from or related to, any            <br /><br /><br />

termination or expiration of this Agreement. Each Party shall in good time (i) respond in             <br /><br /><br />

that would result in an inadequate or inaccurate recording and reporting of assets, liabilities       <br /><br /><br />
or any other transaction, or which would put such Party in violation of its obligations under         <br /><br /><br />
the laws applicable to the operations under this Agreement.                                           <br /><br /><br />

the Contractor has no control, the Contractor may charge Petroleum Operations for                       <br /><br /><br />
