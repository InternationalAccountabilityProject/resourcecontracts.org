time of calculation, are being freely and actively traded in the international market and are similar in characteristics<br /><br />
and quality to the Crude Oil in respect of which the price is being determined, such FOB selling price to be<br /><br />
ascertained from Platt's Crude Oil Market Wire daily publication ("Platt's") or tile spot market for-the same crude<br /><br />
oils ascertained in the same manner, whichever price, in the opinion of the Parties more truly reflects the current<br /><br />
value of such Crude Oils. For any Delivery Period in which sales take place, the price shall be the arithmetic<br /><br />
average price per Barrel determined by calculating the average for such Delivery Period of the mean of the<br /><br />
high and low FOB or spot prices for each day of<br /><br />

from the price as determined in accordance with Article 19.3 for the same Delivery Period, the Parties shall meet<br /><br />
upon notice from any Party, to determine if the prices established for the relevant Delivery Period should be<br /><br />
adjusted taking into account third party Arms Length Sales made by the Contractor of the same or similar Crude<br /><br />
Oil from the relevant Development Area or other Fields and published information in respect of other genuine third<br /><br />
party Arms Length Sales of the same or similar Crude Oil for that Delivery Period. Until the matter of an<br /><br />
adjustment for the relevant Delivery Period is finally determined. the price as established in accordance with this<br /><br />
Article will apply for that Delivery Period. Any adjustment, if necessary, will be made within thirty (30) days from<br /><br />
the date the adjustment for that Delivery Period is finally determined.<br /><br />
