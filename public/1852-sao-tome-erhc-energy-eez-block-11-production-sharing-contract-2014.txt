<br /><br />
with its Associates shall, as the case may be, pay all charges and fees as are imposed by law in<br /><br />
Sao Tome and Principe. The Contractor and its Associates shall not be treated less favorably<br /><br />
from any other Persons engaged in similar petroleum operations in the Territory of Sao Tome<br /><br />
and Principe;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(o)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
indemnify and hold the State, including the National Petroleum Agency, harmless against all<br /><br />
losses, damages, injuries, expenses, actions of whatever kind and nature including all legal fees<br /><br />
and expenses suffered by the State or the National Petroleum Agency where such loss,<br /><br />
damage, injury, expense or action is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the<br /><br />
Contractor, its Affiliates, its sub-contractors or any other Person acting on its or their behalf or<br /><br />
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or consultants;<br /><br />
<br /><br />

RECOVERY OF OPERATING COSTS AND SHARING OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be calculated on a Contract Area basis for Royalty Oil, Cost<br /><br />
Oil and Profit Oil. This allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be in accordance with the Accounting<br /><br />
Procedure, the Allocation and Lifting Procedure and this Clause 10 as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Royalty Oil shall be allocated to the State from the first day of Production, based on the daily<br /><br />
total of Available Crude Oil from a Contract Area, set at a rate of 2%;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
17<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be allocated to the Contractor in such quantum as will generate an amount of<br /><br />
Proceeds sufficient for recovery of Operating Costs in each Contract Area. All costs will be<br /><br />
recovered in United States dollars through Cost Oil allocation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be not more than eighty percent (80) % of Available Crude Oil in each Contract<br /><br />
Area less deduction of Royalty Oil in any accounting period;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Profit Oil, being the balance of Available Crude Oil after deducting Royalty Oil and Cost Oil<br /><br />
shall be allocated to each Party based on the pre-tax, nominal rate of return calculated on a<br /><br />
quarterly basis for the Contract Area in accordance with the following sliding scale:<br /><br />
Contractor's Rate of Return for<br /><br />
Contract Area (%per annum)<br /><br />
<16%<br /><br />
>=16 %< 19%<br /><br />
>=19 %< 23%<br /><br />
>=23 %< 26%<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Beginning at the date of Commercial Discovery, Contractor's rate of return shall be determined at the<br /><br />
end of each Quarter on the basis of the accumulated compounded net cash flow for each Contract Area,<br /><br />
using the following procedure:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor's net cash flow for a Contract Area for each Quarter is:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The sum of the Contractor's Cost Oil and share of Contract Area Profit Oil<br /><br />
regarding the Petroleum actually lifted in that Quarter at the Realizable Price;<br /><br />
Minus Operating Costs;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For this computation, neither any expenditure incurred prior to the date of Commercial<br /><br />
Discovery for a Contract Area nor any Exploration Expenditure shall be included in the<br /><br />
computation of the Contractor's net cash flow.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor's net cash flows for each Quarter are compounded and accumulated for a<br /><br />
Contract Area from the date of the Commercial Discovery according to the following formula:<br /><br />
ACNCF (Current Quarter) =<br /><br />
(100% + DQ) x ACNCF (Previous Quarter) + NCF (Current Quarter) 100%<br /><br />
where:<br /><br />
ACNCF = accumulated compounded net cash flow<br /><br />
NCF = net cash flow<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
<br /><br />
DQ = quarterly compound rate (in percent)<br /><br />
The formula will be calculated using quarterly compound rates (in percent) of 3,78%, 4.45%,<br /><br />
5.31%, and 5.95%, which correspond to annual compound rates ("DA") of 16%, 19%, 23%,<br /><br />
and 26%, respectively.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor's rate of return in any given Quarter for a Contract Area shall be deemed to be<br /><br />
between the largest DA which yields a positive or zero ACNCF and the smallest DA which<br /><br />
causes the ACNCF to be negative.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The sharing of Profit Oil from a Contract Area between the State and the Contractor in a given<br /><br />
Quarter shall be in accordance with the scale in paragraph (a) above using the Contractor's<br /><br />
deemed rate of return as per paragraph (c) in the immediately preceding Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In a given Contract Area, it is possible for the Contractor's deemed rate of return to decline as a<br /><br />
result of negative cash flow in a Quarter with the consequence that Contractor's share of Profit<br /><br />
Oil from that Contract Area would increase in the subsequent Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pending finalization of accounts, Profit Oil from the Contract Area shall be shared on the basis<br /><br />
of provisional estimates, if necessary, of a deemed rate of return as approved by the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency. Adjustments shall be effected with the procedure subsequently to be<br /><br />
adopted by the National Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The quantum of Available Crude Oil to be allocated to each Party under this Contract shall be<br /><br />
determined at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each Party shall lift and dispose of its allocation of Available Crude Oil in accordance with the<br /><br />
Allocation and Lifting Procedures as provided in Schedule 3. In the event of any reconciliation, the<br /><br />
records of the National Petroleum Agency shall be the official, final and binding records.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Allocation of Royalty Oil and State Profit Oil shall be in the form of delivery of Production of<br /><br />
Petroleum to the National Petroleum Agency and the National Petroleum Agency or other appropriate<br /><br />
authority shall issue receipts for such delivery within thirty (30) days of lifting such Royalty Oil and<br /><br />
Profit Oil. These receipts are issued by the National Petroleum Agency or other appropriate authority on<br /><br />
behalf of the Government of Sao Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any Party may, at the request of any other Party, lift such other Party's Available Crude Oil pursuant to<br /><br />
Clause 10.3 and the lifting Party within thirty (30) days shall transfer to the account of the non-lifting<br /><br />
Party the Proceeds of the sale to which the non-lifting Party is entitled . Overdue payments shall bear<br /><br />
interest at the rate of LIBOR plus two percent (2%).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The State may sell to the Contractor all or any portion of its allocation of Available Crude Oil from the<br /><br />
Contract Area under mutually agreed terms and conditions at the Realizable Price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
19<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties shall meet as and when agreed in the Allocation and Lifting Procedures to reconcile all<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Petroleum produced, allocated and lifted during the period in accordance with the Allocation and Lifting<br /><br />
Procedures set forth in Schedule 3.<br /><br />
10.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of lifting the State's Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil, the State, upon one<br /><br />
hundred eighty (180) days advance notice to the Operator, issued by the National Petroleum Agency,<br /><br />
may elect to receive the State's allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil in cash based on the<br /><br />
Realizable Price rather than through lifting regardless of whether or not the Contractor sells the State's<br /><br />
Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil to a third party. If the State elects to receive cash in lieu of lifting, the<br /><br />
Operator shall lift the State's allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil and pay into the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Account cash in respect of such lifting within thirty (30) days from the end of the month in<br /><br />
which the lifting occurred. Every six (6) months, the State may elect to have an entity designated by the<br /><br />
State to resume lifting the State's allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil upon one hundred eighty<br /><br />
(180) days notice to the Operator prior to the date the State elects to have an entity, designated by the<br /><br />
State, to resume lifting.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Save as otherwise provided in this Contract, Crude Oil Production shall be valued in accordance with the<br /><br />
following procedures:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On the attainment of commercial production of Crude Oil, each Party shall engage the services<br /><br />
of an independent laboratory of good repute to undertake a qualitative and quantitative analysis<br /><br />
of such Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a new Crude Oil stream is produced, a trial marketing period shall be designated which<br /><br />
shall extend for the first six (6) month period during which such new stream is lifted or for the<br /><br />
period of time required for the first ten ( 10) liftings, whichever is longer. During the trial<br /><br />
marketing period the Parties shall:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
collect samples of the new Crude Oil upon which the qualitative and quantitative<br /><br />
analysis shall be performed as provided in Clause 11.1(a);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
determine the approximate quality of the new Crude Oil by estimating the yield values<br /><br />
from refinery modeling;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
market in accordance with their entitlement to the new Crude Oil and to the extent that<br /><br />
one Party lifts the other Party's allocation of Available Crude Oil, and payments<br /><br />
therefore, shall be made by the buyers to the Operator who will be responsible for<br /><br />
distributing to the other Parties in accordance with their entitlement, Cost Oil and<br /><br />
Profit Oil and the Contractor's accounting shall reflect such revenues, in accordance<br /><br />
with Clause 10;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provide information to a third party who shall compile the information and maintain<br /><br />
all individual Party information confidential, with regard to the marketing of the new<br /><br />
Crude Oil, including documents which verify the sales price and terms of each lifting;<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
apply the actual F.0.B. sales price to determine the value for each lifting which F.O.B.<br /><br />
sales pricing for each lifting shall continue, as the Realizable Price, after the trial<br /><br />
marketing period until the Parties agree to a valuation of the new Crude Oil but in no<br /><br />
event longer than ninety (90) days after conclusion of the trial marketing period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As soon as practicable but in any event not later than sixty (60) days after the end of the trial<br /><br />
marketing period, the Parties shall meet to review the qualitative and quantitative analysis, yield<br /><br />
and actual sales data. Each Party may present a proposal for the valuation of the new Crude Oil.<br /><br />
A valuation formula for the Realizable Price shall be agreed to by the Parties not later than nine<br /><br />
(9) months after the first lifting. It is the intent of the Parties that such prices shall reflect the true<br /><br />
market value based on arm's length transactions for the sale of the new Crude Oil. The valuation<br /><br />
formula, as determined hereinbefore (including the product yield values), shall be mutually<br /><br />
agreed within thirty (30) days of the aforementioned meeting, failing which, it shall be referred<br /><br />
to a mutually agreed independent expert who shall have the appropriate international oil and gas<br /><br />
experience and who will resolve and settle the matter in a manner as he shall in his absolute<br /><br />
discretion think fit and the decision of the expert shall be final and binding on the Parties. If,<br /><br />
after a period of thirty (30) days, the Parties are unable to agree on the identity of the expert,<br /><br />
such expert shall be appointed by the International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the<br /><br />
provisions for the appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the International<br /><br />
Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon the conclusion of the trial marketing period, the Parties shall be entitled to lift their<br /><br />
allocation of Available Crude Oil pursuant to Clause 10.3 and the Allocation and Lifting<br /><br />
Procedures set forth in Schedule 3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a new Crude Oil stream is produced from the Contract Area and is commingled with an<br /><br />
existing Crude Oil produced, which has an established Realizable Price basis, then such basis<br /><br />
shall be applied to the extent practicable for determining the Realizable Price of the new Crude<br /><br />
Oil. The Parties shall meet and mutually agree on any appropriate modifications to such<br /><br />
established valuation basis, which may be required to reflect any change in the market value of<br /><br />
the Crude Oils as a result of commingling.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If, in the opinion of either the National Petroleum Agency or the Contractor, an agreed price valuation<br /><br />
method fails to reflect the market value of Crude Oil produced in the Contract Area, then such Party may<br /><br />
propose to the other Party modifications to such valuation method once in every six (6) months but in no<br /><br />
event more than twice in any Calendar Year. The Parties shall then meet within thirty (30) days of such<br /><br />
proposal and mutually agree on any modifications to such valuation within thirty (30) days from such<br /><br />
meeting, failing which, the issue shall be referred to a mutually agreed independent expert who shall<br /><br />
have the appropriate international oil and gas experience<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and who will resolve and settle the matter in a manner as he shall in his absolute discretion think fit and<br /><br />
the decision of the expert shall be final and binding on the Parties. If after a period of thirty (30) days,<br /><br />
the Parties are unable to agree on the identity of the expert, such expert shall be appointment by the<br /><br />
International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the provisions for the appointment of experts<br /><br />
under the Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
11.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Segregation of Crude Oils of different quality and/or grade shall, by agreement of the Parties, take into<br /><br />
consideration, among other things, the operational practicality of segregation and the cost benefit<br /><br />
analysis thereof. If the Parties agree on such segregation the following provisions shall apply:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any and all provisions of this Contract concerning valuation of Crude Oil shall separately apply<br /><br />
to each segregated Crude Oil produced; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
each grade or quality of Crude Oil produced and segregated in a given year shall contribute its<br /><br />
proportionate share to the total quantity designated in such year as Royalty Oil, Cost Oil and<br /><br />
Profit Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.<br /><br />

TITLE TO EQUIPMENT I DECOMMISSIONING<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall finance the cost of purchasing or leasing all materials, equipment and facilities to be<br /><br />
used in Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area pursuant to approved Work Programs and Budgets<br /><br />
and such materials, equipment and facilities, if purchased, shall become the sole property of the State<br /><br />
when the Contractor has recovered the cost of such materials, equipment and facilities (as the case may<br /><br />
be) in accordance with this Contract or upon its termination, whichever occurs first, free of all liens and<br /><br />
other encumbrances. Except as otherwise provided for in the Petroleum Law, the Contractor and the<br /><br />
State, including the National Petroleum Agency, shall have the right to use all materials, equipment and<br /><br />
facilities exclusively for Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area during the term of this Contract and<br /><br />
any extensions thereof. Should the State or the National Petroleum Agency desire to use such materials,<br /><br />
equipment and facilities outside the Contract Area, such use shall be subject to terms and conditions<br /><br />
agreed by the Parties, provided that it is understood that Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area<br /><br />
hereunder shall take precedence over such use by the State or the National Petroleum Agency. The<br /><br />
Contractor shall only lease materials, equipment and facilities with the approval of the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld if such lease is in the best interest of<br /><br />
the Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor's right to use such purchased materials, equipment and facilities shall cease with the<br /><br />
termination or expiration (whichever is earlier) of this Contract, including any extensions hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions of clause 13.1, with respect to the title of property passing to the State, shall not apply to<br /><br />
leased equipment belonging to local or foreign third parties, and such equipment may be freely exported<br /><br />

<br /><br />
13.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to clause 13.2, all fixed assets purchased or otherwise acquired by the Contractor for the<br /><br />
purposes of Petroleum Operations hereunder shall become the property of the State when the Contractor<br /><br />
has recovered the cost of such materials, equipment and facilities (as the case may be) in accordance<br /><br />
with this Contract or upon its termination, whichever occurs first. Upon termination of this Contract, the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor shall hand over possession of such fixed assets to the State in good working order and free of<br /><br />
all liens and other encumbrances.<br /><br />
13.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the term of this Contract, any agreed sales of equipment, land, fixed assets, materials and<br /><br />
machinery acquired for the purpose of Petroleum Operations shall be conducted by the Contractor on the<br /><br />
basis of the procedure for sale of assets as set forth in Schedule 5, subject to the consent of the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning<br /><br />
The expenditure for Decommissioning will be estimated on the basis of technical studies undertaken by<br /><br />
the Contractor, to be agreed by the National Petroleum Agency, as part of each Field Development<br /><br />
Program and revised as necessary.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise agreed by the National Petroleum Agency, the procedure for the Contractor providing<br /><br />
funds to meet its Decommissioning obligations shall be as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
an amount shall be established on a Contract Area basis, commencing two years after the start<br /><br />
of Production Period, on a unit of production basis as follows:<br /><br />
DP = (PVDC - DF) * ( P / RP), where:<br /><br />
DP = Decommissioning provision for the period (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
PVDC =Present Value of Decommissioning costs (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
DF = Balance of Decommissioning fund at the start of the period (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
P=<br /><br />
Crude Oil production in the period (millions of Barrels)<br /><br />
RP =<br /><br />
Estimated remaining Crude Oil (millions of Barrels)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All Decommissioning provisions shall be held in a Decommissioning reserve fund which shall<br /><br />
be an interest bearing escrow account jointly established by the Parties at a first class<br /><br />
commercial bank or other financial institution in accordance with the Petroleum Law. The bank<br /><br />
or financial institution shall have a long term rating of not less than "AA" by Standard and<br /><br />
Poor's Corporation or an "Aa2" rating by Moody's Investor Service or a comparable rating by<br /><br />
another mutually agreed rating service.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purposes of calculating the present value of Decommissioning costs, the following<br /><br />
formula shall be used:<br /><br />
PVDC =EDC / (1 + i)n, where:<br /><br />
PVDC =present value of Decommissioning costs<br /><br />
EDC = estimated value of Decommissioning costs in nominal terms at the expected date of<br /><br />
Decommissioning<br /><br />
i=<br /><br />
interest rate applicable to the escrow account in the current period<br /><br />
n=<br /><br />
number of Years between current period and expected date of Decommissioning<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Decommissioning reserve fund shall be used solely for the purposes of paying for<br /><br />
Decommissioning activities. No Party may mortgage, pledge, encumber or otherwise use such<br /><br />
Decommissioning reserve fund for any purpose whatsoever, except as expressly provided herein or in<br /><br />
the Petroleum Law. The Decommissioning reserve fund may be invested in investments approved in<br /><br />
advance by the Contractor and the National Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall annually meet any shortfall between the actual Decommissioning costs and the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning reserve fund for any Contract Area, with such amount<br /><br />
<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to be deposited into the escrow account within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Year.<br /><br />
13.10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any balance remaining in any Decommissioning fund after all Decommissioning costs in the Contract<br /><br />
Area have been met shall be distributed between the National Petroleum Agency and the Contractor in<br /><br />
the same proportion as the allocation of Available Crude Oil at the time of Decommissioning operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning expenditures incurred under these Decommissioning provisions are both cost<br /><br />
recoverable as Contract Area non-capital costs under the Accounting Procedure and deductible for Tax<br /><br />
purposes under the Petroleum Taxation Law.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Qualified nationals from Sao Tome and Principe shall be employed in all non specialized positions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Qualified nationals from Sao Tome and Principe shall also be employed in specialized positions such as<br /><br />
those in exploration, drilling, engineering, production, environmental safety, legal and finance. The<br /><br />
Contractor shall have the right, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, to employ non-nationals<br /><br />
of Sao Tome and Principe in such specialized positions where qualified individuals from Sao Tome and<br /><br />
Principe are not available, provided that the Contractor shall recruit and train nationals from Sao Tome<br /><br />
and Principe for such specialized positions such that the number of expatriate staff shall be kept to a<br /><br />
minimum.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pursuant to Clause 9(k), qualified competent professionals of the National Petroleum Agency shall be<br /><br />
assigned to work with the Contractor and such personnel and the Contractor's national personnel from<br /><br />
Sao Tome and Principe shall not be treated differently with regard to salaries and other benefits. The<br /><br />

Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to principles of public international law, no term of this Contract including the agreement of the<br /><br />

rights.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor discovers a commercially viable quantity of Natural Gas, the Contractor shall have the<br /><br />
right to develop, commercialize, recover the costs and share in the profits of a development of such<br /><br />
Natural Gas under this Contract on terms to be mutually agreed. Such terms when agreed shall become<br /><br />
an integral part of this Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding Clause 23.1, the Contractor may utilize, at no cost, Natural Gas required as fuel for<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations such as gas recycling, gas injection, gas lift or any other Crude Oil enhancing<br /><br />
recovery schemes, stimulation of wells necessary for maximum Crude Oil recovery in the field<br /><br />
discovered and developed by the Contractor and such usage shall be with prior written consent of the<br /><br />
National Petroleum Agency, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This shall be included<br /><br />
in a Field Development Program.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The attainment of recovery of Crude Oil through an efficient, economic and technically acceptable<br /><br />
method shall always be paramount in all decisions regarding Associated Natural Gas. However, prior to<br /><br />
the commencement of Production of Crude Oil from the Contract Area, the Contractor shall submit to<br /><br />
the National Petroleum Agency, a program for the utilization of any Associated Natural Gas that has<br /><br />
been discovered in the Contract Area, which shall be subject to the approval of the National Petroleum<br /><br />
Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor discovers sufficient volumes of Unassociated Natural Gas that could justify<br /><br />
commercial development, the Contractor shall immediately report the volume of potentially recoverable<br /><br />
Natural Gas to the National Petroleum Agency and shall promptly investigate and submit proposals to<br /><br />
the National Petroleum Agency for the commercial development of such Natural Gas taking in<br /><br />
consideration local strategic needs as may be identified by the National Petroleum Agency, within two<br /><br />
(2) years of the date of the relevant discovery. Any cost in respect of such proposals or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
34<br /><br />
<br /><br />
investigation presented by the Contractor to the National Petroleum Agency shall be included in<br /><br />
Operating Costs. The Contractor and the National Petroleum Agency will determine the plan and time<br /><br />
needed, which shall be no more than five (5) years, unless otherwise agreed by the National Petroleum<br /><br />
Agency, to progress a commercial development project, which shall include the terms for recovery of<br /><br />
Operating Costs and sharing of Natural Gas production, which terms when agreed shall form an integral<br /><br />
part of this Contract. If the Contractor fails to justify a commercial development within the agreed<br /><br />
<br /><br />
timeframe and if the National Petroleum Agency determines that a sufficient volume of Unassociated<br /><br />
Natural Gas exists, the National Petroleum Agency shall have the right to propose to the Contractor a<br /><br />
commercial development of such Natural Gas. The Contractor shall have the right to participate in the<br /><br />
commercial development under terms pursuant to Clause 23.1. If the Contractor declines to participate<br /><br />
in the commercial development of such Natural Gas as presented by the National Petroleum Agency and<br /><br />
if the Field Development Program does not hinder or jeopardize current Petroleum Operations, the<br /><br />
National Petroleum Agency may develop the Natural Gas in the manner presented to the Contractor.<br /><br />
