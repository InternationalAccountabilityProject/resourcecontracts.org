BETWEEN<br /><br />
THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA<br /><br />
AND<br /><br />
SIME DARBY PLANTATION (LIBERIA) INC.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	This Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into this 30 day of April 2009 by and between THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA, represented by the acting Minister of Agriculture, Borkai Sirleaf and the Minister of Finance, Augustine Ngafuan, and attested to by the Minister of Justice, Hon. Phillip A.Z. Banks, III, (hereinafter referred to as the "Government") and Sime Darby Plantation (Liberia) Inc., a corporation duly organized under the Laws of the Republic of Liberia, represented by it's authorized representative Mr Dato' Azhar Abdul Hamid, (hereinafter referred to as the "Investor").<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WITNESSETH:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS, a Concession Agreement (the "Original Concession Agreement") was entered into between Government and B.F. Goodrich Company on July 9, 1954 under the terms of which B.F. Goodrich was granted a concession to engage in, inter alia, agriculture, forestry, and farming in all their branches and all activities in connection therewith, including planting, cultivating, harvesting, processing and marketing of products, especially rubber; on an area of 600,000 acres of land situated along the St. John River in Grand Bassa County and along the St. Paul, Morro and Lofa Rivers in Southwestern Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS with the consent of Government, B.F. Goodrich's rights, obligations, liabilities, privileges and benefits under the Original Concession Agreement were transferred and assigned to Guthrie Corporation Ltd of the United Kingdom ("Guthrie UK") and in turn to Kumpulan Guthrie Sendirian Berhad, the parent company of Guthrie UK.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS, the Original Concession Agreement was amended on November 22, 1985, to reflect, inter alia, the sale, assignment and transfer of the concession rights thereunder to Kumpulan Guthrie Sendirian Berhad (subsequently known as Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad) ("KGB") and Government's consent thereto; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS, due to the Liberian civil war, KGB suffered substantial damage and loss to its concession facilities and assets in Liberia and the disruption of its Liberian business operations; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS, as a result of the Liberian civil war, KGB was forced to abandon its operations and on October 30, 2001 gave notice to Government that it was temporarily suspending its performance under the Original Concession Agreement due to the security situation in and around the concession area, including but not limited to the insurgency of dissident forces within Northern and Northwestern Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
	WHEREAS, during KGB's suspension of its operations under the Original Concession Agreement, Government has appointed various Officials and Persons to act in various capacities<br /><br />
<br /><br />
LONDOCS\3038230.01		1as interim management ("Interim Management") to continue and manage the operations in Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, Government has assured KGB that the civil conflict in Liberia has ceased and has invited KGB to resume operations in Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, KGB has expressed interest in resuming operations in Liberia and desires to make significant new investment in Liberia upon receipt of assurances from Government as to the tax, fiscal and other terms that will govern, or apply to, KGB's investment and operations in Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, the Government recognizes that foreign direct investment in the agricultural sector is a key component of its post-conflict rebuilding process and acknowledges the economic benefits that will result from KGB's business operations and other investments, including without limitation, the generation of employment opportunities, export revenue and downstream economic activities in Liberia; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, in November 2007, pursuant to a merger, Sime Darby Berhad (formerly known as Synergy Drive Bhd) acquired from KGB the entire business and undertaking of KGB, including all the rights, title, interest and benefit of KGB under the Original Concession Agreement; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, Investor is a subsidiary of Sime Darby Berhad; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, the Government desires to provide Investor with 220,000 hectares of land for the cultivation of oil palm and rubber trees and subsequent production of oil palm and rubber products for use in Liberia or for export. Of this area, 120,000 hectares was originally provided for under the terms of the Original Concession Agreement, and an additional 100,000 hectares is being provided in consideration of Investor's commitment to construct and operate a vegetable oil refinery in Liberia.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Investor agrees that so long as the remainder of the Term is adequate and sufficient to assure the viability of a replanting program, Investor shall commence replanting relevant parcels of land comprised in the Concession Area within twelve (12) months of the End of Cycle of each such identified parcel of land, in accordance with the Development Plan. In the event new oil palms or rubber trees are not planted within twelve (12) months after the End of Cycle for the relevant parcel of land, or if Investor gives Notice to Government that it will neither replant nor, with the consent of Government, use the relevant parcel of land for Investor Activities, then Government has the option to repossess the parcel of land that has not been replanted. Investor shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to replant so long as Investor has begun the replanting process prior to the end of such twelve (12) month period and diligently continues its efforts to replant.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    8.6    Failure to Develop.

<br /><br />
LONDOCS\3038230.01develop and plant. If after the end of such six (6) month period Government is of the reasonable opinion that the default cannot be cured, then the undeveloped portion of the Concession Area shall be forfeited to Government. In the event that the Investor's failure to develop the Concession Area is due to the fact that the land is not free from Encumbrances or to any act, omission or default of Government or agents of Government or to an event of Force Majeure, then Investor shall not be held responsible for the delay or for not developing the Concession Area. Investor's failure to develop the Concession Area in accordance with the Minimum Development Obligations set forth in Section 8.6 shall not constitute an Event of Default for purposes of Section 26.2(a) and Government's sole remedy in the event of a breach of Section 8.6 shall be to repossess the undeveloped land in accordance with this Section 8.6.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.7 Domestic Use.
