The title of Article 11 shall be modified to “Article 11: Determination of CBM Development” and the content of that<br /><br />
Article is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:<br /><br />
11.1 If any Coalbed Methane Discovery is made within the Contract Area, the Operator shall promptly report such<br /><br />
discovery to JMC. If JMC or Contractor makes a decision that a Coalbed Methane Discovery is worthy of a Pilot Test, the<br /><br />
Operator shall submit to JMC a Pilot Test Work Program which shall include a CBM Reserves Report compilation, plans<br /><br />
for disposal of any CBM and/or Liquid Hydrocarbons whether by sale, flaring or otherwise and a timetable for such<br /><br />
Coalbed Methane Discovery as soon as possible. Such Pilot Test Work Program shall be prepared no later than sixty (60)<br /><br />
days from the date of the aforesaid decision made by JMC or Contractor. After the approval by JMC of the Pilot Test Work<br /><br />
Program, the Operator shall implement the operation as soon as possible without unreasonable delay in accordance with the<br /><br />
timetable set forth in the approved Pilot Test Work Program.<br /><br />
11.2 After receipt of notice of proven reserves of a Coalbed Methane Field from the Ministry of Land and Resources of the<br /><br />
People's Republic of China, the Contractor, as the Operator, shall prepare and submit to JMC an Overall Development<br /><br />

of coal mining operations in the relevant coal field. After approval by the relevant Chinese governmental authority, such<br /><br />
Overall Development Program and any supplemental agreement shall be regarded as an integrated part of the Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.3 Long-term CBM, CBM Products and Liquid Hydrocarbons transportation and sales agreements shall be concluded<br /><br />
prior to the completion of compilation of Overall Development Program. Before the conclusion of the transportation and<br /><br />
sales agreements, both Parties shall use their best efforts to find suitable counterparties for long-term CBM, CBM Products<br /><br />
and Liquid Hydrocarbons transportation and sales agreements, and try to conclude such transactions.<br /><br />
11.4 If JMC unanimously decides that a reserves report will not be prepared for a particular Coalbed Methane Discovery, at<br /><br />
the request of the Contractor, the corresponding area covered by the Coalbed Methane Discovery may be retained in the<br /><br />
Contract Area during the exploration period. However, if, at the expiration of the exploration period, the JMC still<br /><br />
unanimously decides that a reserves report will not be prepared for the aforesaid Coalbed Methane Discovery, the area<br /><br />
covered by such Coalbed Methane Discovery shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
11.5 If the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the exploration period, advises JMC in writing that it will not prepare a<br /><br />
reserves report for a Coalbed Methane Discovery, the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived its rights of participation<br /><br />
in the development of that Coalbed Methane Field, then CUCBM shall have the right to solely develop such potential<br /><br />
Coalbed Methane Field.<br /><br />
Before the expiration of the exploration period, if the Parties do not unanimously approve the compilation of a reserves<br /><br />
report for a particular Coalbed Methane Discovery, Contractor may continue to compile the reserve report in accordance<br /><br />
with Chinese CBM reserves regulations and CUCBM shall assist Contractor to submit the reserve report that meets<br /><br />
Chinese proven reserves standards. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of proven reserves of a Coalbed Methane<br /><br />
Field from the Ministry of Land and Resources of the People’s Republic of China, CUCBM will make its election to<br /><br />
participate in accordance with Article 2.4 hereof.<br /><br />

in the following circumstances: additional development projects referring to the Overall Development Program designed<br /><br />
either to improve the production capability of the reservoir or to substantially increase the recoverable reserves therefrom<br /><br />
through additional investments. Any extension of the production period of the Coalbed Methane Field due to such<br /><br />
additional development projects shall be subject to the related provision of Article 4.5 hereof.<br /><br />
11.7 Notwithstanding the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production or anything to the contrary herein, the<br /><br />
allocation of the production from a Pilot Test shall be governed by the principles set forth in Articles 12 and 13 hereof.<br /><br />
