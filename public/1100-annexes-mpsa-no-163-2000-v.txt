The topography of the area is moderate to rugged with dominantly              <br /><br /><br />
northwest rending ridges. Elevation within the claim area varies from         <br /><br /><br />
40 to 350 meters above sea level.                                             <br /><br /><br />
The project sites in Rapu-Rapu experience two (2) pronounce seasons.          <br /><br /><br />
The wet season caused by northeast monsoon start from October to              <br /><br /><br />
February while the dry season occurs for the rest of the year.                <br /><br /><br />

The Philippine Airlines provides daily B 737 service to Legaspi from          <br /><br /><br />
Manila with a flying time of approximately 45 minutes. A daily                <br /><br /><br />
scheduled ferry and motorized banca (small outrigger boat) service            <br /><br /><br />
provides access to Rapu-Rapu town from Legaspi City. Travel time is           <br /><br /><br />
2 to 4 hours depending on vessel type and weather conditions. Small           <br /><br /><br />
fishing vessels may be chartered in Rapu-Rapu wharf/pier docks to             <br /><br /><br />
provide access to outlying villages on the coast of Rapu-Rapu. Travel         <br /><br /><br />
time from Rapu-Rapu pier dock to Barrio Malobago, the landing area            <br /><br /><br />
for base camp at Barrio Pagcolbon, is 40 minutes to one (1) hour by           <br /><br /><br />
motorized fishing banca.                                                      <br /><br /><br />

The major creeks and their tributary system have dominantly dendritic         <br /><br /><br />
pattern draining generally southeastward into the Albay Gulf. A               <br /><br /><br />
dominant trellis pattern of the drainage system is apparently due to the      <br /><br /><br />
schistosity and faulting of the rocks in the area. Water is available from    <br /><br /><br />
the creeks the whole year round.                                              <br /><br /><br />

Elsewhere the forest has largely removed by “kaingin” (slash and bum)         <br /><br /><br />
agricultural practices. Only small portion of the land area is planted        <br /><br /><br />
with coconut, banana, abaca and other fruit-bearing trees. Second and         <br /><br /><br />
third growth trees common in the vicinity grew in the interior and along      <br /><br /><br />
creeks and steeply dipping slopes. The rest of the area is cogon grass        <br /><br /><br />
and shrubs.                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

more or less along the creeks and outcrop. Detailed mapping will be               <br /><br /><br />
conducted on selected areas after identifying the significant occurrences         <br /><br /><br />
of mineralization. The result will be used to plan targets for sub surface        <br /><br /><br />
evaluation such as test pitting, and diamond drilling if necessary.               <br /><br /><br />
The equipment to be used are magnetic compass, measuring tape,                    <br /><br /><br />
