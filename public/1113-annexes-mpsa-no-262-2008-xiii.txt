Large part of the Project Area is characterized by moderately sloping        <br /><br /><br />
to hilly topography with high peaks of not more than 461 meters above        <br /><br /><br />
sea level. To the east is characterized by steep hills and mountains         <br /><br /><br />
with high peaks of 616 masl.                                                 <br /><br /><br />
Generally, the central mountainous terrain is cut by rectangular             <br /><br /><br />
drainage systems controlled by multiple fracture patterns. The Agsao         <br /><br /><br />

 River is apparently controlled by a NS trending fault and supplied by       <br /><br /><br />
 angular branching tributaries draining east.                                <br /><br /><br />
                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
 Northern portion is karstic topographic highland of limestone               <br /><br /><br />
 characterized by sinkholes, depressions, irregular outlines of steep        <br /><br /><br />
 cliffs particularly in the western rims. Rounded knob of resistant          <br /><br /><br />
 limestone are surrounded by elongated depressions drained by deeply         <br /><br /><br />
 incised streams.                                                            <br /><br /><br />

 alluvial terrace gravel. Gently sloping alluvial fan covers periphery of    <br /><br /><br />
 mountainous ridges and is probably produced from rapid deposition of        <br /><br /><br />
 sediments by the river systems. Rectangular drainage system                 <br /><br /><br />
 connects to meandering mainstreams towards the western lowlands.            <br /><br /><br />

 Agusan del Sur does not have its own airport faciiity/ies. Davao City       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
 and Butuan City are the nearest airport facilities. Bunawan is about        <br /><br /><br />
 two (2) hours drive (110 km.) from Butuan and about three (3) hours         <br /><br /><br />
 from Davao City. These Cities are serviced daily by Philippine Airline,     <br /><br /><br />
 Air Philippines and Cebu Pacific from Manila.                               <br /><br /><br />
 Considering Agusan del Sur is located in the Central Part of Mindanao,      <br /><br /><br />
                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
 there are no port facilities. The ports of Davao and Butuan (Nasipit)       <br /><br /><br />
 are serviced by passenger and cargo ships to Manila and other ports         <br /><br /><br />
 of destination and vice versa.                                              <br /><br /><br />
 4.3    Drainage System                                                      <br /><br /><br />

 The Agsao River and its tributaries serves as the main drainage in the      <br /><br /><br />
 area following a southeast flow and draining to one of the principal        <br /><br /><br />
 drainage south of the area - the Bunawan River. West is the Sumilao         <br /><br /><br />
 River which empties its load to Agusan River. Other tributary streams       <br /><br /><br />
 and minor creeks within the area are intermittent and are waterlogged       <br /><br /><br />
 only during the rainy season.                                               <br /><br /><br />
 During the months of the rainy season, particularly during nearby rains,    <br /><br /><br />
 the waters in the major drainage swell and sometimes developed into         <br /><br /><br />
 minor floods. All the waters of the rivers and its tributaries were         <br /><br /><br />
 drained into the sea. All these are the factors which contribute to the     <br /><br /><br />
 complete process of the never-ending hydrologic cycle in the area           <br /><br /><br />
 resulting to an excellent climate and the abundant and continuous           <br /><br /><br />
 water supply of the surrounding barangays and neighboring localities.       <br /><br /><br />

﻿south, passing just east of Banahaw. Sinistral             <br /><br /><br />
displacement along the fault exceeds 200 km.               <br /><br /><br />
The Philippines has a significant history of mining and    <br /><br /><br />
metals production, principally copper and gold, with       <br /><br /><br />
lesser nickel, molybdenum and silver. All the major        <br /><br /><br />
deposits are found along mobile orogenic belts,            <br /><br /><br />
commonly in clusters and are predominantly the products    <br /><br /><br />
of epithermal mineral associated with episodic             <br /><br /><br />
magmatism and intrusive rock emplacement, either into      <br /><br /><br />
breccia or shear structures or in the form of porphyry     <br /><br /><br />
deposits. The mineralizing events have been dated from     <br /><br /><br />
Early Cretaceous (110My) to Miocene (20My).                <br /><br /><br />
The Project lies at the central portion of Eastern         <br /><br /><br />
Mindanao Highlands forming the Diwata Mountain             <br /><br /><br />
Ranges. Rocks consist largely of ophiolitic piles of       <br /><br /><br />
Paleogene age, overlain by andesitic rocks, plutons and    <br /><br /><br />
sedimentary sequences of Neogene age as described by       <br /><br /><br />
Caldwell, et al, (1980); and McCaffrey et al, (1980) (in   <br /><br /><br />
UNDP, 1984 Geology of Northern Agusan Mindanao).           <br /><br /><br />
Many epithermal gold and porphyry copper type mineral      <br /><br /><br />
are hosted within these units running from Surigao to      <br /><br /><br />
Davao.                                                     <br /><br /><br />
Some 200 kilometers east of these highlands is the west    <br /><br /><br />
dipping-east verging Philippine Subduction System          <br /><br /><br />
considered by Hamilton (1979) and Moore (1980) as a        <br /><br /><br />
young morphological feature of probable Pliocene age       <br /><br /><br />
and consisting of imprecated sheets of ophiolite and       <br /><br /><br />
sedimentary rocks accreted from a subducting ocean         <br /><br /><br />
floor.                                                     <br /><br /><br />
West of the Eastern Mindanao Highlands lies the            <br /><br /><br />
Agusan-Davao trough, a NS trending sedimentary basin       <br /><br /><br />
of pre-Eocene age dividing the Eastern Mindanao            <br /><br /><br />
Highlands from the Central Mindanao Cordillera. Central    <br /><br /><br />
Mindanao Cordillera encompasses a broad, geologically      <br /><br /><br />
complex region consisting of multiple east-dipping thrust  <br /><br /><br />
sheets that overlie Cretaceous-Paleogene metamorphic       <br /><br /><br />
rocks.                                                     <br /><br /><br />
To the south lies the Pujada peninsula, a terrane of       <br /><br /><br />
ophiolitic rocks with folded metamorphic rocks at the sole <br /><br /><br />
of west dipping thrust sheets dated Cretacious-            <br /><br /><br />
Paleogene, and correlatable with the serpentinites and     <br /><br /><br />
related ophiolites in Agusan del Norte (by UNDP, 1980)     <br /><br /><br />
and in Central Bukidnon (by Santiago, A.B., 1982).         <br /><br /><br />
Southwest of the area includes a north-trending            <br /><br /><br />
magmatic ridge occupied by active and dormant              <br /><br /><br />
﻿andesitic stratovolcanoes probably Miocene to recent in     <br /><br /><br />
age.                                                        <br /><br /><br />
5.1.1.2 Local Geology                                       <br /><br /><br />
Andesitic flows and voicaniclastic rocks intruded by        <br /><br /><br />
dykes and sills of feldspar andesite porphyry are the       <br /><br /><br />
oldest rock units in the area. These intercalated layers of <br /><br /><br />
rocks have a general NW strike and SW dip. Andesitic        <br /><br /><br />
flows consist mainly of hornblendephyric to plagiophyric    <br /><br /><br />
varieties. In fresh outcrops, they are light gray with a    <br /><br /><br />
matrix of feldspar and hornblende rnicrolaths with short    <br /><br /><br />
stubby feldspar and hornblende phenocrysts. Where           <br /><br /><br />
propylitization has affected the rock, chlorite replaces    <br /><br /><br />
hornblende rendering a greenish coloration. Flow            <br /><br /><br />
structure is obvious in andesites as shown by the parallel  <br /><br /><br />
alignments of feldspar and hornblende.                      <br /><br /><br />
Voicaniclastic rocks of andesitic origin vary from wacke    <br /><br /><br />
to mudstone with occasional beds of intertongued flow       <br /><br /><br />
breccia. Bedding laminations are faintly visible and are    <br /><br /><br />
exhibited only in the finer sediments while graded          <br /><br /><br />
bedding is well displayed in wacke and mudstone.            <br /><br /><br />
A large diorite pluton intrudes the southwest part of the   <br /><br /><br />
area, and several small diorite epophyses are found in      <br /><br /><br />
the central portion. The diorite is massive but exhibits    <br /><br /><br />
blocky fracturing. Flow structures are shown as parallel    <br /><br /><br />
alignments of phenocrysts while some rocks exhibit          <br /><br /><br />
equigranular texture with phenocrysts of randomly           <br /><br /><br />
oriented feldspar. Quartz occurs as a varietal component    <br /><br /><br />
(2% of the rock.). Dissemination of black minerals,         <br /><br /><br />
probably magnetite, gives the rock a “peppered”             <br /><br /><br />
appearance. Chlorite and epidote occur as fracture          <br /><br /><br />
fillings and as replacement of hornblende. Quartz           <br /><br /><br />
veinlets cut the diorite in places suggesting the           <br /><br /><br />
hydrothermal fluid effect on the rock. Minor aplitic dykes  <br /><br /><br />
cut the volcanic hosts.                                     <br /><br /><br />
Limestone crops out in the far NE portion of the area, as   <br /><br /><br />
small isolated bodies. This limestone lies                  <br /><br /><br />
stratigraphically over the volcanics and related rocks as   <br /><br /><br />
an erosional remnant. The limestone is cream-colored        <br /><br /><br />
and displays karst topography featuring numerous            <br /><br /><br />
sinkholes and depressions. The basal part consists of       <br /><br /><br />
calcisiltite and marl grading upward to massive coralline   <br /><br /><br />
algal limestone.                                            <br /><br /><br />
Widespread occurrence of loosely consolidated gravel        <br /><br /><br />
dominates the western part of the area. These               <br /><br /><br />
sediments are made up of horizontally lying beds of thick   <br /><br /><br />
﻿gravel, silt, mud with clasts of various compositions. The    <br /><br /><br />
gravel uncomformably cover older rock units. This is the      <br /><br /><br />
youngest lithologic unit found in the area.                   <br /><br /><br />
The known mineral and former operating mines are              <br /><br /><br />
concentrated within the northern leasehold portion over a     <br /><br /><br />
5-km strike length. The central portion of the tenements      <br /><br /><br />
is largely covered by the younger lithic tuff sequence and    <br /><br /><br />
there are few outcrops of the agglomerate horizon. To         <br /><br /><br />
the south of the area, mineralized silicified agglomerate     <br /><br /><br />
is again an exposed and additional prospects and mine         <br /><br /><br />
occur.                                                        <br /><br /><br />
5= 1,1.3 Structure                                            <br /><br /><br />
North to northeast trending structural lineaments cut the     <br /><br /><br />
Greater Co’o area most prominent is Buan fault striking       <br /><br /><br />
N45°E and dips steeply to the NW. A wrench fault, which       <br /><br /><br />
rotated the downthrown block to the west, and cuts the        <br /><br /><br />
limestone exposed 3 kilometers southwest from Buan            <br /><br /><br />
Plant. Sharp, triangular faceted ridges and offset            <br /><br /><br />
streams characterize the footwall of this fault and up        <br /><br /><br />
northeast the fault cuts andesites and related sediments.     <br /><br /><br />
Several NE trending lineaments traverse the                   <br /><br /><br />
southeastern sector, in an en echelon manner, and             <br /><br /><br />
interpreted as a result of extensional stresses initiated by  <br /><br /><br />
the sinistral movements of the Philippine ‘Master Fault’      <br /><br /><br />
ten kilometers west of the area.                              <br /><br /><br />
Several major faults cross the mine working that currently    <br /><br /><br />
extends over a strike length of about 600m. From east to      <br /><br /><br />
west, the faults are “Oriental Fault” (100/80 - Dip           <br /><br /><br />
direction/dip angle), “Irak Fault” (300/70 on 150m level      <br /><br /><br />
flattening to 300/45 on the 220m level), “No Name Fault”      <br /><br /><br />
(280/70), “Tinago Fault” (300/65), “Joe’s Fault” (270/90)     <br /><br /><br />
and the westernmost “Unnamed Fault” (270/90). All             <br /><br /><br />
faults are at least locally mineralized.                      <br /><br /><br />
The overall structural vein trend and supplementary splits    <br /><br /><br />
obviously define multiple cymoidal structural patterns        <br /><br /><br />
generally trending E-W. At least three major veins            <br /><br /><br />
appear linked by supplementary vein splits generally in a     <br /><br /><br />
200 meters zone, about 900 meters in length. (Figure          <br /><br /><br />
3.3).                                                         <br /><br /><br />
                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 The veins exhibit “pinch and swell” characteristics, with    <br /><br /><br />
 sinous curves and inflections recognizable in                <br /><br /><br />
 underground openings and drill cores. Vein dips are          <br /><br /><br />
 generally NE in surface trenches and confirmed by            <br /><br /><br />
 diamond drilling.                                            <br /><br /><br />
﻿Veins dip steeply to the north with some splits having           <br /><br /><br />
reversed dips that re-connect with the main veins at             <br /><br /><br />
depth. The veins in the south, however, dip 45° to               <br /><br /><br />
vertical towards the east.                                       <br /><br /><br />
The Agsao River draining south is controlled by a NNW            <br /><br /><br />
trending fault.                                                  <br /><br /><br />
Bedding in sedimentary rocks is well displayed with NW           <br /><br /><br />
strike and NE to SW dips indicating folding. Where               <br /><br /><br />
silicification has altered the rock, bedding is obscured.        <br /><br /><br />
5.1.1.4 Mineralization and Alteration Zoning                     <br /><br /><br />
Mineralized structures exhibit irregular but persistent          <br /><br /><br />
alteration selvages, most common is sericitic clay               <br /><br /><br />
defining a narrow zone enveloped by silicified zones.            <br /><br /><br />
Veins display multiple branching and an anastomising             <br /><br /><br />
mesh-pattern, central to a 300 meter-wide zone of                <br /><br /><br />
sericitic alteration grading spatially to propylitic alteration. <br /><br /><br />
(Figure 3.4).                                                    <br /><br /><br />
Veins are mainly quartz, calcite and barite, occurring as        <br /><br /><br />
irregular masses within the main quartz body. Quartz             <br /><br /><br />
appears as massive or cryptocrystalline in irregular             <br /><br /><br />
bands and open fractures. Pervasive silicification within        <br /><br /><br />
the enclosing country rocks is displayed as total                <br /><br /><br />
replacement of the host lithology and grades of sericitic        <br /><br /><br />
alteration. Contact is gradual and irregular.                    <br /><br /><br />
Argillic (sericitic) alteration occurs as narrow selvages        <br /><br /><br />
parallel to the veins and laterally dispersed to tens of         <br /><br /><br />
meters. Some irregular stockworking of quartz veinlets           <br /><br /><br />
and stringers cut the argillic alteration probably as late       <br /><br /><br />
stage silica flooding.                                           <br /><br /><br />
Widely distributed of propylitic alteration is peripheral to     <br /><br /><br />
main mineralized zones. Chloritization is pervasive              <br /><br /><br />
within the host lithologies and commonly alters                  <br /><br /><br />
ferromagnesian minerals in andesite. Epidote is                  <br /><br /><br />
commonly associated as fracture or cavity filling.               <br /><br /><br />
1. Quartz + lllite ± Pyrite ± Barite + Calcite                   <br /><br /><br />
Quartz is the most dominant mineral, about 90%                   <br /><br /><br />
of vein material. Breccia textures are                           <br /><br /><br />
characterized by angular to surrounded silicified                <br /><br /><br />
rock and quartz fragments surrounded by masses                   <br /><br /><br />
of fine quartz, interstitial illite fibers, pyrite and           <br /><br /><br />
sphene. Feldspar as relict traces is completely                  <br /><br /><br />

                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
                  replaced by illite or illite-smectite and admixtures   <br /><br /><br />
                  of quartz and pyrite. Early quartz is surrounded by    <br /><br /><br />
                  streaks of illite threads.                             <br /><br /><br />

                  are possible targets for trenching or test pitting. The    <br /><br /><br />
                  main objective is to determine the lateral and vertical    <br /><br /><br />
                  extent of the targets by exposing them (excavating of      <br /><br /><br />
                  the overburden) for geologic mapping and sampling.         <br /><br /><br />
                  The depth of the overburden or soil and the width of the   <br /><br /><br />

Sample preparation is a very important step in the methods of assaying. If proper       <br /><br /><br />
preparation is not used, the analysis will not be valid.                                <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                        <br /><br /><br />

1.    General Drying Of Samples                                                         <br /><br /><br />
Safety glasses, hard hat, respirator, ear protection must be worn while                 <br /><br /><br />
operating crusher and pulverizer.                                                       <br /><br /><br />
Exhaust fan must be on while operating crusher and pulverizer.                          <br /><br /><br />
Sample pans are washed with water and stiff brush after use and left stacked            <br /><br /><br />
upside down to dry.                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
2.    All sample brought to the lab must be completely dry before they are to be        <br /><br /><br />
prepared.                                                                               <br /><br /><br />
Geology sampler are placed in sample pans along with corresponding tag and              <br /><br /><br />
placed in drying oven. There they should stay for between 1-3 hours. Muck               <br /><br /><br />
chips or sludge sampler will take more times drying as their moisture content it        <br /><br /><br />
much higher.                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
Mill filter cakes day shift are usually dry in the morning, however, the night shift    <br /><br /><br />
samples are still wet as they out usually around 5:00AM. To quicken the drying          <br /><br /><br />
of these samples, the pulp can be broken up and mashed in their respective              <br /><br /><br />
pans and dry in the hot plate to speed drying.                                          <br /><br /><br />
Carbon samples can be placed on hot plate to finish drying.                             <br /><br /><br />
Temperature of drying oven should be get approximate 105°C-120°C, too high              <br /><br /><br />
temperature may cause some roasting.                                                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
3. Crushing                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
When dry, samples are taken out and cooled. The samples should be placed                <br /><br /><br />
in sequence order to minimize sample mix-ups. The samples should be                     <br /><br /><br />
crushed on primary crusher to the smallest size possible, approximately %”              <br /><br /><br />
then put through the secondary crusher, crusher entirely samples into 1 1/2mm-          <br /><br /><br />
2mm. Paper bags marked with corresponding numbers and the appropriate tag               <br /><br /><br />
placed inside. Remember to carry tags along with samples during processes.              <br /><br /><br />
Note: Crusher should be well cleaned between each sample with compressed                <br /><br /><br />
air to prevent contamination.                                                           <br /><br /><br />
﻿4. Riffling or Splitting                                                              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
 The crushed sample can be placed back in original pan or riffled immediately         <br /><br /><br />
 after crushing. The purpose is to reduce the sample size to 300-500g. The            <br /><br /><br />
 rejects are stored in the pans and stack up in the shelve. The oldest are thrown     <br /><br /><br />
 out to make room for the most recent on daily basis, usually about 4 days            <br /><br /><br />
 retention is kept. The Diamond drill core samples are put it back in the original    <br /><br /><br />
 plastic bag and kept for 3 month or more them discard (inform geology before         <br /><br /><br />
 discard).                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
 Mill pulps are broken up with spatula, roll on a mat and 500-600g are cut with       <br /><br /><br />
 spatula. At this point, the marked bag containing tap is placed in pan and           <br /><br /><br />
 sample is ready for next step.                                                       <br /><br /><br />
 Note: Riffle should be well cleaned with compressed air and checked for bits or      <br /><br /><br />
 rock stuck in bafflers between each sample.                                          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
5. Pulverizing                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
All samples are pulverized in right pulverizer or Bico disc pulverizer, they          <br /><br /><br />
should be 100% minus-200. Pulverized samples have to be mixed to ensure               <br /><br /><br />
that they are homogenous, sample is ready for next step.                              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
6. Rolling                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
Rolling is a very important step in sample preparation. It is done to assure that     <br /><br /><br />
the sample will be homogenous before assaying.                                        <br /><br /><br />

3. Fusion                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
When all samples properly prepared, they are placed in fire assay furnace         <br /><br /><br />
which has been preheated to 2000 0 degree F. Be careful not to let                <br /><br /><br />
temperature in furnace drop to much while loading. It is advisable to put the     <br /><br /><br />
pots in rows of four starting with the last row going in front and the first row  <br /><br /><br />
going in last. The samples are then fused for approximately 45 minutes to 1       <br /><br /><br />
hour.                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
When fusion is complete, the crucibles are taken out one at a time with tongs     <br /><br /><br />
and poured into cast iron conical molds. Pouring should be done fairly show so    <br /><br /><br />
that molten lead will not splash on side of mold. They are then allowed to cool   <br /><br /><br />
for 5-10 minutes. When cooled, the slag is broken off with banner. (Safety        <br /><br /><br />
glasses must be worn for this). The lead button is then hammered into the         <br /><br /><br />
shape of cube. This will clean all slag from button and make for better handling  <br /><br /><br />
with tongs. The cubed lead is then placed on lead button tray making sure that    <br /><br /><br />
the order is kept throughput.                                                     <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
4. Cupellation                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
A suitable amount of cuples are placed in furnace and allowed to heat for 5-10    <br /><br /><br />
minutes. At that time, the lead cubes are placed in respective cupels and         <br /><br /><br />
allowed to melt. This takes only a few minutes as the melting point of lead is    <br /><br /><br />
low. Then the lead has melted and has opened (when black scum has                 <br /><br /><br />
cleared), the temperature in furnace is lowered to 17500F, the door is opened     <br /><br /><br />
slightly and piece of rebar is placed under the door. This allows air into the    <br /><br /><br />
furnace to oxidize the molten lead. This usually takes 45 minutes - 1 hour.       <br /><br /><br />
When all the lead has been oxidized or absorbed into the cupel, the silver bead   <br /><br /><br />
will flash marking the end of cupellation. The cupel are then removed from the    <br /><br /><br />
furnace with cupel fork, placed on steel table under fume hood allows to cool.    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

Large part of the Project Area is characterized by moderately                     <br /><br /><br />
sloping to hilly topography with high peaks of not more than 461                  <br /><br /><br />
meters above sea level. To the east is characterized by steep                     <br /><br /><br />
hills and mountains with high peaks of 616 masl.                                  <br /><br /><br />
Generally, the central mountainous terrain is cut by rectangular                  <br /><br /><br />
drainage systems controlled by multiple fracture patterns. The                    <br /><br /><br />
Agsao River is apparently controlled by a NS trending fault and                   <br /><br /><br />
supplied by angular branching tributaries draining east.                          <br /><br /><br />
Northern portion is karstic topographic highland of limestone                     <br /><br /><br />
characterized by sinkholes, depressions, irregular outlines of                    <br /><br /><br />
steep cliffs particularly in the western rims. Rounded knob of                    <br /><br /><br />
resistant limestone are surrounded by elongated depressions                       <br /><br /><br />
drained by deeply incised streams.                                                <br /><br /><br />
A relatively flat topography on the western side is dominated by                  <br /><br /><br />
wide alluvial terrace gravel. Gently sloping alluvial fan covers                  <br /><br /><br />
periphery of mountainous ridges and is probably produced from                     <br /><br /><br />
rapid deposition of sediments by the river systems. Rectangular                   <br /><br /><br />
drainage system connects to meandering mainstreams towards                        <br /><br /><br />

 The Agsao River and its tributaries serves as the main drainage               <br /><br /><br />
 in the area following a southeast flow and draining to one of the             <br /><br /><br />
 principal drainage south of the area - the Bunawan River. West                <br /><br /><br />
 is the Sumilao River which empties its load to Agusan River.                  <br /><br /><br />
 Other tributary streams and minor creeks within the area are                  <br /><br /><br />
 intermittent and are waterlogged only during the rainy season.                <br /><br /><br />

 The Philippines has a tropical climate, with a mean annual lowland            <br /><br /><br />
 temperature of about 27°C (80°F). The climate over any particular             <br /><br /><br />

﻿Ranges. Rocks consist largely of ophiolitic piles of        <br /><br /><br />
Paleogene age, overlain by andesitic rocks, plutons and     <br /><br /><br />
sedimentary sequences of Neogene age as described by        <br /><br /><br />
Caldwell, et al, (1980); and McCaffrey et al, (1980) (in    <br /><br /><br />
UNDP, 1984 Geology of Northern Agusan Mindanao).            <br /><br /><br />
Many epithermal gold and porphyry copper type mineral       <br /><br /><br />
are hosted within these units running from Surigao to       <br /><br /><br />
Davao.                                                      <br /><br /><br />
Some 200 kilometers east of these highlands is the west     <br /><br /><br />
dipping-east verging Philippine Subduction System           <br /><br /><br />
considered by Hamilton (1979) and Moore (1980) as a         <br /><br /><br />
young morphological feature of probable Pliocene age        <br /><br /><br />
and consisting of imprecated sheets of ophiolite and        <br /><br /><br />
sedimentary rocks accreted from a subducting ocean          <br /><br /><br />
floor.                                                      <br /><br /><br />
West of the Eastern Mindanao Highlands lies the             <br /><br /><br />
Agusan-Davao trough, a NS trending sedimentary basin        <br /><br /><br />
of pre-Eocene age dividing the Eastern Mindanao             <br /><br /><br />
Highlands from the Central Mindanao Cordillera. Central     <br /><br /><br />
Mindanao Cordillera encompasses a broad, geologically       <br /><br /><br />
complex region consisting of multiple east-dipping thrust   <br /><br /><br />
sheets that overlie Cretaceous-Paleogene metamorphic        <br /><br /><br />
rocks.                                                      <br /><br /><br />
To the south lies the Pujada peninsula, a terrane of        <br /><br /><br />
ophiolitic rocks with folded metamorphic rocks at the sole  <br /><br /><br />
of west dipping thrust sheets dated Cretacious-             <br /><br /><br />
Paleogene, and correlatable with the serpentinites and      <br /><br /><br />
related ophiolites in Agusan del Norte (by UNDP, 1980)      <br /><br /><br />
and in Central Bukidnon (by Santiago, A.B., 1982).          <br /><br /><br />
Southwest of the area includes a north-trending             <br /><br /><br />
magmatic ridge occupied by active and dormant andesitic     <br /><br /><br />
stratovolcanoes probably Miocene to recent in age.          <br /><br /><br />
4.4.1.2 Local Geology                                       <br /><br /><br />
Andesitic flows and volcaniclastic rocks intruded by        <br /><br /><br />
dykes and sills of feldspar andesite porphyry are the       <br /><br /><br />
oldest rock units in the area. These intercalated layers of <br /><br /><br />
rocks have a general NW strike and SW dip. Andesitic        <br /><br /><br />
flows consist mainly of hornblendephyric to plagiophyric    <br /><br /><br />
varieties. In fresh outcrops, they are light gray with a    <br /><br /><br />
matrix of feldspar and hornblende microlaths with short     <br /><br /><br />
stubby feldspar and hornblende phenocrysts. Where           <br /><br /><br />
propylitization has affected the rock, chlorite replaces    <br /><br /><br />
hornblende rendering a greenish coloration. Flow            <br /><br /><br />
structure is obvious in andesites as shown by the parallel  <br /><br /><br />
alignments of feldspar and hornblende.                      <br /><br /><br />
﻿Volcaniclastic rocks of andesitic origin vary from wacke to  <br /><br /><br />
mudstone with occasional beds of intertongued flow           <br /><br /><br />
breccia. Bedding laminations are faintly visible and are     <br /><br /><br />
exhibited only in the finer sediments while graded           <br /><br /><br />
bedding is well displayed in wacke and mudstone.             <br /><br /><br />
A large diorite pluton intrudes the southwest part of the    <br /><br /><br />
area, and several small diorite epophyses are found in       <br /><br /><br />
the central portion. The diorite is massive but exhibits     <br /><br /><br />
blocky fracturing. Flow structures are shown as parallel     <br /><br /><br />
alignments of phenocrysts while some rocks exhibit           <br /><br /><br />
equigranular texture with phenocrysts of randomly            <br /><br /><br />
oriented feldspar. Quartz occurs as a varietal component     <br /><br /><br />
(2% of the rock.). Dissemination of black minerals,          <br /><br /><br />
probably magnetite, gives the rock a “peppered”              <br /><br /><br />
appearance. Chlorite and epidote occur as fracture           <br /><br /><br />
fillings and as replacement of hornblende. Quartz            <br /><br /><br />
veinlets cut the diorite in places suggesting the            <br /><br /><br />
hydrothermal fluid effect on the rock. Minor aplitic dykes   <br /><br /><br />
cut the volcanic hosts.                                      <br /><br /><br />
Limestone crops out in the far NE portion of the area, as    <br /><br /><br />
small isolated bodies. This limestone lies                   <br /><br /><br />
stratigraphically over the volcanics and related rocks as    <br /><br /><br />
an erosional remnant. The limestone is cream-colored         <br /><br /><br />
and displays karst topography featuring numerous             <br /><br /><br />
sinkholes and depressions. The basai part consists of        <br /><br /><br />
calcisiitite and marl grading upward to massive coralline    <br /><br /><br />
algal limestone.                                             <br /><br /><br />
Widespread occurrence of loosely consolidated gravel         <br /><br /><br />
dominates the western part of the area. These                <br /><br /><br />
sediments are made up of horizontally lying beds of thick    <br /><br /><br />
gravel, silt, mud with clasts of various compositions. The   <br /><br /><br />
gravel uncomformably cover older rock units. This is the     <br /><br /><br />
youngest lithologic unit found in the area.                  <br /><br /><br />
The known mineral and former operating mines are             <br /><br /><br />
concentrated within the northern leasehold portion over a    <br /><br /><br />
5-km strike length. The central portion of the tenements     <br /><br /><br />
is largely covered by the younger lithic tuff sequence and   <br /><br /><br />
there are few outcrops of the agglomerate horizon. To        <br /><br /><br />
the south of the area, mineralized silicified agglomerate is <br /><br /><br />
again an exposed and additional prospects and mine           <br /><br /><br />
occur.                                                       <br /><br /><br />

 Several domesticated animals such as carabaos, horses,           <br /><br /><br />
 pigs and chicken could be found in the area, but limited         <br /><br /><br />
 since the place is not an agricultural lands and only very       <br /><br /><br />
 few residents till their lands for farming purposes.             <br /><br /><br />

 The area is located in the central part of Mindanao. There may   <br /><br /><br />
 be fish species in the muddy water along the river. The          <br /><br /><br />
 absence of any residents catching for fish show that if ever     <br /><br /><br />
 there are fishes, they are just few and not edible for human     <br /><br /><br />

 6.2    On Hydrology and Water Quality                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 8.2.1    Potential generation of acid mine drainage                     <br /><br /><br />
                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 During exploration, there will be no generation of acid mine            <br /><br /><br />
 drainage. However, during the mining stage, if warranted, there         <br /><br /><br />
 may be a possibility of acid mine drainage formation and                <br /><br /><br />
 measures will be installed to prevent its formation.                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 6.2.2    Siltation and pollution of surface waters                      <br /><br /><br />
 Some of the potential environmental effects identified are as           <br /><br /><br />
 follows:                                                                <br /><br /><br />
 >    water contamination due to human waste                             <br /><br /><br />
 >    siltation due to excavations and clearing of vegetations           <br /><br /><br />
 >    soil contamination due to human related waste.                     <br /><br /><br />
 >    Drilling fluids and cuttings may also contaminate the              <br /><br /><br />
 surface waters if not properly handled.                                 <br /><br /><br />
 6.2.3    Changes in hydrology                                           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 Negligible changes in water availability and quality and in the         <br /><br /><br />
 drainage patters is expected due to exploration activities.             <br /><br /><br />
 6.3    On the Ecology                                                   <br /><br /><br />
                                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 Although minimal in extent, there is still a possibility that the       <br /><br /><br />
 exploration activities and other related human activities may have a    <br /><br /><br />
 significant effect to the existing ecological balance within the area.  <br /><br /><br />
 Some of these effects are identified as follows:                        <br /><br /><br />
 >    displacement of flora and fauna due to clearing of vegetation.     <br /><br /><br />
 >    Noise and waste generation.                                        <br /><br /><br />

 6.4 On Socio-economic Environment                                            <br /><br /><br />
                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 The introduction of exploration activities over the Project Area may         <br /><br /><br />
 have very little significant effect to the socio-economic condition of the   <br /><br /><br />
 area considering that the extent of work to be done is relatively small.     <br /><br /><br />
 Only a number of locally hired residents may be benefited during             <br /><br /><br />
 exploration activities. These are some of the identified effects on the      <br /><br /><br />
 socio-economic conditions in the project area and its vicinity:              <br /><br /><br />
 >    Displacement of socio-economic activities                               <br /><br /><br />
 >    confused perception by local residents due to misinformation of         <br /><br /><br />
 project implementation                                                       <br /><br /><br />
 >    dust generation                                                         <br /><br /><br />
 >    safety of workers during the excavation of testpits may be              <br /><br /><br />
 compromised                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 >    migration into the project area due to wrong speculations.              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                              <br /><br /><br />

Areas affected by exploration activities such as stripped lands due to        <br /><br /><br />
drill path and drill site construction will be replanted/re-vegetated. This   <br /><br /><br />
will prevent landslides and mitigate soil erosion. Ripraps on potential       <br /><br /><br />
slide areas shall be constructed. During exploration, ensuring                <br /><br /><br />
minimum standards as to track and grid line widths can minimize               <br /><br /><br />
vegetation removal.                                                           <br /><br /><br />

Only a limited number of trenches and testpits will be dug and the            <br /><br /><br />
removed soil and rocks will be saved and the same shall be used as            <br /><br /><br />
backfill materials immediately after sampling and mapping. Care will          <br /><br /><br />
be exercise that diggings will be backfilled first with sulphides laden       <br /><br /><br />
spoils followed by the upper layer of the removed earth. This prevents        <br /><br /><br />
the sulphides form being exposed and later dissolved/leached, which           <br /><br /><br />
may lead to the formation of acid mine drainage. The refilled                 <br /><br /><br />
excavation sites will then be replanted. Disposal areas of removed            <br /><br /><br />
earth shall also be re-vegetated and drainage canals will be provided         <br /><br /><br />
whenever necessary.                                                           <br /><br /><br />
7.3    Maintenance of roads to minimize dust                                  <br /><br /><br />

 one or two settling pits will be constructed to contain and precipitate      <br /><br /><br />
 the sludge. These pits will be backfilled by earth/soil immediately after    <br /><br /><br />
 drilling. Aside from diesel, petrol and drilling mud, no other hazardous     <br /><br /><br />
 chemical will be used during the Exploration Period. Fuel storage sites      <br /><br /><br />
 shall be provided with bunds lined with impervious materials to prevent      <br /><br /><br />
 contamination of the soil in case of spillage.                               <br /><br /><br />
