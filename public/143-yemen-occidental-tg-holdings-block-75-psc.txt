If Crude Oil is discovered but is not deemed by the CONTRACTOR to be a Commercial Discovery of Oil under the above provisions of Article 3.5, the MINISTRY shall, after one (1) Month from the expiry of the period specified above within which the CONTRACTOR can give notice of a Commercial Discovery of Oil, have the right after sixty (60) Days from providing a written notice to the CONTRACTOR, and at the MINISTRY's sole risk and expense, to develop, produce and dispose of all Crude Oil from the geological feature in which said Crude Oil was discovered as aforesaid. Said notice shall state the specific area (the "Proposed Sole Risk Area") covering said geological feature to be developed, the wells to be drilled, the production facilities to be installed and the MINISTRY's estimated cost thereof, provided however that, within thirty (30) Days after receipt of said notice, the CONTRACTOR may, in writing, elect to develop the Proposed Sole Risk Area as provided for in this Agreement in the case of a Commercial Discovery, in which event, all terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply to the Proposed Sole Risk Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the CONTRACTOR elects not to develop such Proposed Sole Risk Area, the said area (thenceforth the "Sole Risk Area") covering said geological feature shall be set aside for sole risk operations by the MINISTRY. The Sole Risk Area shall be mutually agreed upon by the MINISTRY and the CONTRACTOR on the basis of good Petroleum Industry practices. The MINISTRY shall be entitled to have the Operator or a third party perform such operations for it at the MINISTRY's sole risk and expense, provided that such third partie's operations shall not interfere with the Contractor's Petroleum Operations and should be conducted according to the good international petroleum industry practices. When the MINISTRY has recovered from the Crude Oil produced from the Sole Risk Area a quantity of Crude Oil equal in value to three hundred percent (300%) of the cost it has incurred in carrying out the sole risk operations, the CONTRACTOR shall have the option, only in the event there has been a separate Commercial Discovery of Oil or Gas elsewhere within the Agreement Area, to share in further Development of the Sole Risk Area upon paying the MINISTRY one hundred percent (100%) of the costs incurred by the MINISTRY in conducting the sole risk operations. At least one (1) Month prior to the estimated recovery date, the MINISTRY shall give written notice to the CONTRACTOR and allow the CONTRACTOR access to the data to evaluate the option, as may be requested by the CONTRACTOR. The one hundred percent (100%) payment shall not be recovered by the CONTRACTOR.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Agreement Block (75)             16Immediately following such payment the Sole Risk Area shall either (1) revert to the status of an ordinary Development Area under this Agreement and thereafter shall be operated in accordance with the terms hereof; or(2) alternatively, in the event that at such time the MINISTRY or its Dependent Units are conducting Development operations in the Sole Risk Area at its or their sole expense and the MINISTRY elects to continue operating the Sole Risk Area, that area shall remain set aside and the CONTRACTOR shall only be entitled to its percentage of the Production Sharing Oil as specified in Article 7.3 below. The Crude Oil from the Sole Risk Area shall be valued in the manner provided in Article 7.4. In the event of any termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Article 3.4.1 or Article 3.4.2 above, this Agreement shall, however, continue to apply to the MINISTRY's operation of any sole risk project.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Cash and accrual accounts shall be maintained as coordinated with the MINISTRY.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 6<br /><br />
TAX IMPLEMENTATION PROVISIONS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is understood that the CONTRACTOR shall be subject to ROY Income Tax Laws except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, that any ROY Income Taxes paid by the MINISTRY on the CONTRACTOR's behalf constitutes additional income to the CONTRACTOR, and this additional income is always subject to ROY income Taxes, that is "grossed-up".<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The CONTRACTOR's annual income, as determined in Article 9.1.2 of the Agreement less the amount equal to CONTRACTOR's grossed-up Yemen income tax liability, shall be CONTRACTOR's "Provisional Income".<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The "gross-up value" is an amount added to Provisional Income to give "Taxable Income", such that the gross-up value is equivalent to ROY Income Taxes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Therefore:<br /><br />
Taxable Income = Provisional Income Plus Gross - up Value and <br /><br />
Gross-up Value = ROY Income Tax on Taxable Income Combining the first and last equations above,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Gross-up Value =<br /><br />
Provisional Income X Tax Rate,<br /><br />
1 - Tax Rate<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where the tax rate is expressed as a decimal.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The above equations are illustrated by the following numerical example. Assuming that the Provisional Income in Ten United States Dollars (U.S. $10), and that pursuant to Article 9.1.3 of the Agreement that ROY Income Taxes rate as applied to the CONTRACTOR would be sixty percent (60%), then the Gross-up Value is equal to:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
U.S. $10x0.6   =   U.S. $15.00<br /><br />
-----------<br /><br />
     1-0.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Therefore:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                                                                U.S. $<br /><br />
Provisional Income                                   10.00<br /><br />
Plus Gross-up Value                                15.00<br /><br />
Taxable Income                                       25.00<br /><br />
Less: ROY Income Taxes at 60%               15.00<br /><br />
CONTRACTOR 's Income after taxes         10.00<br /><br />

<br /><br />
SAMPLE CALCULATION OF ROYALTY, COST OIL, AND PRODUCTION SHARING OIL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Assuming that the Monthly Average Daily Net Production ("MADNP") is 80,000 BBL, then calculations of the shares of MINISTRY and CONTRACTOR would be as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. Deduction of Royalty owned by the STATE from the total amount of 80,000 BBL according to Article 3.2 of the Agreement as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3% of first     25,000 BBL  = 750 BBL<br /><br />
5% of next    25,000 BBL  = 1,250 BBL<br /><br />
6% of next    25,000 BBL  = 1,500 BBL<br /><br />
8% of next      5,000 BBL  = 400 BBL<br /><br />
_____________________________________<br /><br />
Royalty                             = 3,900 BBL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And the remaining amount of MADNP after the deduction of Royalty would come to be:<br /><br />
80,000 BBL - Royalty of 3,900 BBL = 76,100 BBL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. From the remaining amount of MNDNP calculated above we deduct the Cost Oil as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a) Assuming the daily recoverable costs exceed the value of the maximum Cost Oil calculated at the percentage stated in Article 7.1. of this Agreement ("maximum percentage")<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil = 76,100 x 50 = 38,050 BBL<br /><br />
                -----------<br /><br />
                      100<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b) Assuming the daily recoverable costs are $300,00 and are less than the value of the maximum Cost Oil calculated at the maximum percentage; and assuming the Cost Oil value is $20/BBL.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil = Daily Recoverable Costs<br /><br />
                ---------------------<br /><br />
    Value (per barrel) of the Cost Oil<br /><br />
    under Article 7.3 of the Agreement<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil =   $300,000<br /><br />
                   --------<br /><br />
                   $20/BBL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil = 15,000 BBL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Note:<br /><br />
For the purpose of this Annex G, "daily recoverable costs" means the recoverable costs allocated to the applicable Quarter divided by the number of days in such Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. The remaining MADNP ("Production Sharing Oil"), i.e., MADNP after deduction of (i) Royalty and (ii) Cost Oil (2a or 2b above, as applicable), according to Article 7.2 of this Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
MINISIRY's Share = The Production Sharing Oil<br /><br />
