Suspension or abandonment of production of a CBM Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Suspension of production from a CBM Field within the production period<br /><br />
In the event that the Parties agree to suspend temporarily production<br /><br />
from a CBM Field which has entered into commercial production, the<br /><br />
Production Area covered by the CBM Field shall be retained within the<br /><br />
Contract Area. In no event shall the period of such retention extend<br /><br />
beyond the date of the expiration of the production period of that CBM<br /><br />
Field. The duration of the relevant period of production suspension and<br /><br />
the arrangement for the maintenance operations during the aforesaid<br /><br />
period of suspension shall be proposed by the Operator, and shall be<br /><br />
decided by JMC through discussion. With respect to the aforesaid CBM<br /><br />
Field which has been suspended and retained within the Contract Area, in<br /><br />
the event that production is restored during the period of such<br /><br />
retention, the production period of that CBM Field shall be extended<br /><br />
correspondingly. In the event that the Parties fail to reach an<br /><br />
agreement on the restoration of production by the expiration of the<br /><br />
production suspension period decided by JMC through discussion, the<br /><br />
Party who wishes to restore production shall have the right to restore<br /><br />
production solely. The other Party may later elect to participate in<br /><br />
production by paying to the other Party its participating interest share<br /><br />
of the costs incurred in restoring such production, but shall have no<br /><br />
rights or obligations in respect of such CBM Field for the production<br /><br />
during such solely restored production period.<br /><br />
In any event, the obligation for abandonment and site restoration shall<br /><br />
rest solely with the Party(s) which participate in the restored<br /><br />
production; which shall indemnify and hold harmless any<br /><br />
non-participating Party from any costs, expenses or claims arising out<br /><br />
of such obligation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

provided, however, that prior written notice shall be given to the other<br /><br />
Party to the Contract. The other Party shall make a response in writing<br /><br />
within ninety (90) days from the date on which the said notice is<br /><br />
received. If the other Party also agrees to abandon production from the<br /><br />
said CBM Field, then abandonment costs shall be paid by the Parties in<br /><br />
proportion to their participating interests in such CBM Field. The<br /><br />
Parties shall abandon such CBM Field in accordance with procedure agreed<br /><br />
on by the Parties. From the date on which the abandonment is completed,<br /><br />
the production period of such CBM Field shall be terminated and such CBM<br /><br />
Field shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
4.6.2.2 If the Contractor notifies CUCBM in writing of its decision to abandon<br /><br />
production from a CBM Field while CUCBM decides not to abandon<br /><br />
production from said CBM Field, then from the date on which the<br /><br />
Contractor receives CUCBM's written response of its aforesaid decision<br /><br />
(the "Abandonment Date"), all of the Contractor's rights and obligations<br /><br />
under the Contract in respect of said CBM Field, including, but not<br /><br />
limited to, any obligation with respect to abandonment and site<br /><br />
restoration in respect of such CBM Field, shall be transferred to CUCBM<br /><br />
and terminated automatically with respect to Contractor, provided that<br /><br />
the Contractor shall not transfer to CUCBM any of the Contractor's<br /><br />
debts, existing liabilities and obligations in respect of the said CBM<br /><br />
Field. In addition, the Contractor shall undertake its existing<br /><br />
liabilities and obligations under the Contract prior to the Abandonment<br /><br />
Date. From the Abandonment Date, the said CBM Field shall be excluded<br /><br />
from the Contract Area.<br /><br />

herein in regard to the minimum exploration work commitment for any phase<br /><br />
of the exploration period, the increased or reduced exploration work shall<br /><br />
become the new minimum exploration work commitment for the Contractor to<br /><br />
fulfill in the said phase.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At the expiration of any phase during the exploration period, if the<br /><br />
exploration work actually fulfilled by the Contractor is less than the<br /><br />
minimum exploration work commitment for such phase<br /><br />
9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
or less than the new minimum exploration work commitment in Article 6.6<br /><br />
herein, and if, regardless of whether the expected minimum exploration<br /><br />
expenditures are fulfilled or not fulfilled, the Contractor opts to<br /><br />
terminate the Contract under Article 6.3 (c) herein, or if the said phase<br /><br />
is the last exploration phase, subject to the approval of the Department<br /><br />
or Unit the Contractor shall be allowed to transfer its unfulfilled<br /><br />
minimum exploration work commitment to another Contract Area as agreed by<br /><br />
the Contractor and CUCBM, or the Contractor shall, within thirty (30) days<br /><br />

work commitment ( or of the new such commitment) in U.S. dollars after it<br /><br />
has been converted into a cash equivalent using the method provided in<br /><br />
Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto. However, if the minimum exploration<br /><br />
work commitment for the exploration period is fulfilled while its expected<br /><br />
corresponding minimum exploration expenditures are not fulfilled, the<br /><br />
unfulfilled part shall be deemed as a saving and shall not be paid to<br /><br />
CUCBM.<br /><br />
6.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor shall be allowed the flexibility to transfer all or any part of<br /><br />
the minimum exploration work commitment under this Contract to another<br /><br />
contract area and vice versa. The minimum exploration work commitment<br /><br />
transferred from another contract area to this Contract and vice versa<br /><br />
shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the aggregate exploration<br /><br />
work commitments for both this Contract Area and to the contract area from<br /><br />
which the minimum exploration work commitment was transferred. Nothing<br /><br />
herein contained shall be construed or interpreted to allow any reduction<br /><br />
in the aggregate minimum exploration work commitment for any phase of the<br /><br />
exploration period for this Contract or the contract area from which the<br /><br />
exploration work commitment was transferred.<br /><br />

herein, and the expenditures mentioned in Article 10.2.2 herein:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if expenditures or excess expenditures are determined to be<br /><br />
reasonable, the Operator may incur such expenditures or excess<br /><br />
expenditures again during the same Calendar Year, subject to<br /><br />
Article 10.2 herein; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
if expenditures or excess expenditures are determined to be<br /><br />
unreasonable, the Operator shall not incur such expenditures or<br /><br />
excess expenditures again during the same Calendar Year and such<br /><br />
unreasonable expenditures or excess expenditures shall be dealt<br /><br />
with in accordance with Article 5.4 of Annex II-Accounting<br /><br />
Procedure hereto. However, with respect to the joint operation<br /><br />
conducted by the Contractor and CUCBM specified in Article 8.8<br /><br />
hereof, this provision shall not be applicable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 11: DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIALITY OF CBM<br /><br />
11.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If any CBM Discovery is made within the Contract Area, the Operator<br /><br />
shall promptly report such discovery to JMC. If JMC or the Contractor<br /><br />
makes a decision that a CBM Discovery is worthy of a Pilot Development,<br /><br />
the Operator shall submit to JMC a Pilot Development Work Program which<br /><br />
shall include disposal of any CBM and/or Liquid Hydrocarbons whether by<br /><br />
sale, flaring or otherwise and a timetable for such CBM Discovery as<br /><br />
soon as possible. Such Pilot Development Work Program shall be worked<br /><br />
out no later than ninety (90) days from the date of the aforesaid<br /><br />
decision made by JMC or the Contractor. The Pilot Development Work<br /><br />
Program shall, in so far as is practicable, be based on conducting the<br /><br />
Pilot Development work continuously, with a view to commencing<br /><br />
operations within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of the<br /><br />
aforesaid decision made by JMC or the Contractor.<br /><br />
19<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
11.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
After the approval by JMC of the Pilot Development Work Program referred<br /><br />
to in Article 11.1 herein, the Operator shall carry out the operations<br /><br />
as soon as possible without unreasonable delay in accordance with the<br /><br />
timetable set forth in the approved Pilot Development Work Program.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise specified in the Pilot Development Work Program, within<br /><br />
one hundred and eighty (180) days after the completion of the Pilot<br /><br />
Development, the Operator shall submit to JMC a detailed report on the<br /><br />
evaluation of the potential commerciality of the CBM discovery for<br /><br />
review and discussion. Under special circumstances, the above-mentioned<br /><br />
period may be reasonably extended upon agreement of the Parties.<br /><br />
The Pilot Development report shall include an evaluation of geology,<br /><br />
development, engineering and economics, the Maximum Efficient Rate (MER)<br /><br />
and the estimated duration of the production period determined in<br /><br />
accordance with the international CBM industry practice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If JMC decides unanimously that a CBM Discovery is non-commercial, at<br /><br />
the request of the Contractor, the corresponding area covered by the CBM<br /><br />
Discovery may be retained in the Contract Area during the exploration<br /><br />
period. But if, at the expiration of the exploration period, JMC<br /><br />
unanimously still considers the said CBM Discovery to be non-commercial,<br /><br />
the area covered by the CBM Discovery shall be excluded from the<br /><br />
Contract Area. The preceding shall not apply to a CBM Field which in the<br /><br />
opinion of either Party has potential commercial value but which has not<br /><br />
been developed due to a lack of market, a shortage of consuming<br /><br />
facilities or lack of transportation facilities and/or inability to<br /><br />
negotiate long-term transportation and/or sales agreements.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Prior to the expiration of the exploration period, if any Party<br /><br />
considers that a CBM Discovery which has been determined to be<br /><br />
non-commercial needs to be reappraised because of various favorable<br /><br />
factors, the Operator shall work out a new evaluation report on that CBM<br /><br />
Discovery and submit it to JMC for review and approval.<br /><br />
11.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the exploration period,<br /><br />
advises JMC in writing that any CBM Discovery is non-commercial, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall be deemed to have waived its rights of participating in<br /><br />
the development of that CBM Field, then, CUCBM shall have the right to<br /><br />
solely develop such potential CBM Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When the Parties consider a CBM Discovery to be potentially commercial,<br /><br />
as the Operator, the Contractor shall, within a reasonable amount of<br /><br />
time determined by JMC, prepare and submit to JMC an Overall Development<br /><br />
Program for such CBM Discovery. The Parties shall also negotiate and<br /><br />
enter into a mutually acceptable supplemental agreement in regard to the<br /><br />
development of such CBM Field in a manner that shall not unreasonably<br /><br />
interfere with the planned expansion of coal mining operations in the<br /><br />
relevant coal field. Upon receipt and approval of the Overall<br /><br />
Development Program, JMC shall immediately forward the Overall<br /><br />
Development Program to CUCBM. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of<br /><br />
the Overall Development Program, CUCBM shall submit the Overall<br /><br />
Development Program and supplemental agreement to the competent<br /><br />
authorities of the Chinese government for review and approval. Such<br /><br />
Overall Development Program and supplemental agreement shall be regarded<br /><br />
as an integral part of the Contract upon the approval of the competent<br /><br />
authorities of the Chinese government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Long-term CBM, CBM Products and Liquid Hydrocarbons transportation and<br /><br />
sales agreements shall be concluded prior to the Determination of<br /><br />
Commerciality.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event of a CBM Field Straddling a Boundary or of a potentially<br /><br />
commercial CBM Discovery straddling a boundary of the Contract Area,<br /><br />
CUCBM shall organize the Contractor and the neighboring party(ies)<br /><br />
involved, which may include CUCBM and/or it's Affiliates, to work out a<br /><br />
unitized or new Overall Development Program for such Field or Pilot<br /><br />
Development work program for such CBM Discovery. If such area is<br /><br />
controlled solely by CUCBM and/or its<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
Affiliates, then the Contract Area shall be extended to cover the CBM<br /><br />
Field with the approval of Department or Unit.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If a CBM Discovery without commercial value within the Contract Area and<br /><br />
a CBM discovery outside the Contract Area can be most economically<br /><br />
developed as a commercial CBM Field by common facilities jointly<br /><br />
constructed; or if a CBM discovery without commercial value within the<br /><br />
Contract Area can be economically developed as a commercial CBM Field by<br /><br />
linking it up with existing facilities located outside the Contract<br /><br />
Area, CUCBM shall organize the Contractor and the neighboring party(ies)<br /><br />
involved, which may include CUCBM and/or its Affiliates, to work out an<br /><br />
equitable agreement for construction or utilization and sharing the<br /><br />
costs relative to said facilities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In Article 11 those procedures which reference the Overall Development<br /><br />
Program shall be applied by analogy in the following circumstances:<br /><br />
additional development projects referring to the Overall Development<br /><br />
Program designed either to improve the producing capability of the<br /><br />
reservoir or to substantially increase the recoverable reserves<br /><br />
therefrom through additional investments. Any extension of the<br /><br />
production period of the CBM Field due to such additional development<br /><br />
projects shall be subject to the related provision of Article 4.5<br /><br />
hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production or<br /><br />
anything else to the contrary herein, the allocation of the production<br /><br />
from a Pilot Development shall be governed by the principles set forth<br /><br />
in Articles 12 and 13 hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 12: FINANCING AND COST RECOVERY<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Funds required for the CBM Operations shall be raised by the Operator in<br /><br />
accordance with Work Programs and budgets determined pursuant to the<br /><br />
relevant provisions of the Contract, the provisions described in Annex<br /><br />
II - Accounting Procedure hereto, and the provisions of this Article<br /><br />
12.1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1.1 All the exploration costs required for Exploration Operations shall be<br /><br />
provided solely by the Contractor. For purpose of the Contract, all<br /><br />
costs incurred during the extended period described in Article 4.3<br /><br />
hereof shall be deemed exploration costs and shall be provided solely by<br /><br />
the Contractor.<br /><br />
12.1.2 The development costs required for Development Operations in each CBM<br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area shall be provided by CUCBM and the<br /><br />
Contractor in proportion to their respective participating interests:<br /><br />
thirty percent (30%) by CUCBM and seventy percent (70%) by the<br /><br />
Contractor, unless CUCBM applies the provisions of the second paragraph<br /><br />
of this Article 12.1.2 herein.<br /><br />
In the event that CUCBM, at its option, decides not to participate in<br /><br />
the development of a CBM Field or decides to participate in the<br /><br />
development of such CBM Field to an extent of less than thirty percent<br /><br />
(30%) of the participating interest, CUCBM shall notify the Contractor<br /><br />
in writing of its decision of non-participation or a specific lesser<br /><br />
percentage of the participating interests before the Pilot Development<br /><br />
report is reviewed by JMC pursuant to Article 11.3 hereof. In such case,<br /><br />
if CUCBM does not participate in the development of such CBM Field, the<br /><br />
development costs therein shall be borne solely by the Contractor, or in<br /><br />
case CUCBM participates in the development of such CBM Field to an<br /><br />
extent of less than thirty percent (30%) of the participating interests,<br /><br />
such development costs shall be borne by the Parties in proportion to<br /><br />
their actual respective participating interests.<br /><br />
12.1.3 The operating costs incurred for the performance of the Production<br /><br />
Operations of each CBM Field before the Date of Commencement of<br /><br />
Commercial Production shall be considered as development costs. The<br /><br />
operating costs so incurred after the Date of Commencement of<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
Commercial Production shall be paid respectively by CUCBM and the<br /><br />
Contractor in proportion to their participating interests of the said<br /><br />
CBM Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties, at each other's request, shall cooperate and assist each<br /><br />
other to facilitate the financing of CBM Operations on the best terms<br /><br />
and conditions available. For the purpose of implementation of the<br /><br />
Contract, CUCBM agrees that the Contractor may, when financing, use the<br /><br />
entitlement of its share of production under the Contract as security<br /><br />
for loans, provided that the Contractor shall advise CUCBM in advance<br /><br />
and the loan application therefore shall be examined by CUCBM, and<br /><br />
provided further that the rights and interests of CUCBM under the<br /><br />
Contract shall not be impaired thereby. If CUCBM does not object to the<br /><br />
loan application within thirty (30) days of the receipt thereof, then<br /><br />
the rights and interests of CUCBM under the Contract shall be deemed<br /><br />
not impaired thereby.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All the costs and Pre-Contract Costs incurred in the performance of CBM<br /><br />
Operations shall be recovered in accordance with Annex II - Accounting<br /><br />
Procedure hereto and the following provisions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The operating costs for any given Calendar Year actually incurred by<br /><br />
CUCBM and the Contractor in respect of each CBM Field pursuant to<br /><br />
Article 12.1.3 herein, shall be recovered in kind by the Parties out of<br /><br />
the CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons produced from the said CBM Field during<br /><br />
that Calendar Year in accordance with Annex II - Accounting Procedure<br /><br />
hereto, after the operating costs have been converted into a quantity<br /><br />
of CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons on the basis of the CBM price and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons price determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
Unrecovered operating costs shall be carried forward to the succeeding<br /><br />
Calendar Year(s).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The exploration costs incurred by the Contractor and the Pre-Contract<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Costs incurred by CUCBM shall be recovered as follows:<br /><br />
After the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production of a CBM Field<br /><br />
within the Contract Area, the exploration costs incurred by the<br /><br />
Contractor and Pre-Contract Costs incurred by CUCBM in respect of the<br /><br />
Contract Area shall be recovered in kind out of the CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons produced from any CBM Field within the Contract Area in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 13.2.2.2 hereof, after the exploration costs<br /><br />
and Pre Contract Costs have been converted into a quantity of CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons based on the CBM price and Liquid Hydrocarbons<br /><br />
price determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof. The exploration<br /><br />
costs and Pre-Contract Costs shall be recovered without any Deemed<br /><br />
Interest.<br /><br />
If no CBM Field is discovered within the Contract Area, the exploration<br /><br />
costs incurred by the Contractor and the Pre-Contract Costs incurred by<br /><br />
CUCBM shall be deemed as their loss. Under no circumstances shall CUCBM<br /><br />
reimburse the Contractor for such loss.<br /><br />
12.2.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The development costs in respect of each CBM Field incurred by CUCBM<br /><br />
and the Contractor and Deemed Interest thereon shall be recovered as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2.3.1 After the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production of any CBM<br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area, the development costs in respect of<br /><br />
such CBM Field incurred by CUCBM and the Contractor and Deemed Interest<br /><br />
thereon calculated in accordance with Article 12.2.3.2 herein shall be<br /><br />
recovered in kind out of the CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons produced from<br /><br />
such CBM Field in accordance with Article 13.2.2.2 hereof, after the<br /><br />
development costs and Deemed Interest thereon have been converted into<br /><br />
a quantity of CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons based on the CBM price and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons price determined in accordance with Article 14<br /><br />
hereof.<br /><br />
12.2.3.2 Deemed Interest on the development costs incurred by CUCBM and the<br /><br />
Contractor for each CBM Field within the Contract Area shall be<br /><br />
calculated at a fixed annual compound rate of nine percent (9%) from<br /><br />
the first day of the month following the month in which such<br /><br />
development costs expended by each Party to the Contract are actually<br /><br />
recorded in the Joint Account by the Operator.<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
The detailed method of such calculation shall be as provided in Annex<br /><br />
II - Accounting Procedure hereto.<br /><br />
12.2.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons extracted and delivered from a CBM<br /><br />
Field before the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production shall be<br /><br />
allocated in accordance with Article 12 and Article 13 hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 13: CBM PRODUCTION AND ALLOCATION<br /><br />
13.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Operator shall, in accordance with the production profile, adjusted<br /><br />
as the case may be, set forth in the approved Overall Development<br /><br />
Program for each CBM Field, work out a CBM production and joint<br /><br />
marketing plan for each CBM Field in each Calendar Year and carry out<br /><br />
CBM production pursuant to such plan. Such plan shall have the Operator<br /><br />
receiving all proceeds from sales and making payments and accounting<br /><br />
for cost recovery as detailed below.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Annual Gross Production of CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons of each CBM<br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area in each Calendar Year during the<br /><br />
production period shall be allocated in accordance with the following<br /><br />
sequence and proportions:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The percentages of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder shall be<br /><br />
used for payments of the Value Added Tax and of Royalty respectively<br /><br />
and shall be paid in kind to the relevant authorities of the Chinese<br /><br />
Government through CUCBM.<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Five percent (5%) of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons shall be paid in kind to the competent<br /><br />
<br /><br />
authorities for payment of the Value Added Tax in accordance<br /><br />
with relevant rules and regulations of the People's Republic<br /><br />
of China through CUCBM; and<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Payment of Royalty shall be made pursuant to the relevant<br /><br />
rules and regulations of the People's Republic of China<br /><br />
through CUCBM.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed as the "cost recovery CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons" and shall be used for payments or for cost<br /><br />
recovery in the following sequence:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.2.1 Payment in kind for the operating costs actually incurred but not yet<br /><br />
recovered by the Parties pursuant to Article 12.2.1 hereof based on the<br /><br />
price of the said "cost recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons"<br /><br />
determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
13.2.2.2 The remainder of the "cost recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" shall,<br /><br />
after payment for operating costs in accordance with Article 13.2.2.1<br /><br />
herein, be deemed as "investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons".<br /><br />
Such "investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" shall be used<br /><br />
for the recovery of the exploration costs incurred and not yet<br /><br />
recovered by Contractor in respect of the Contract Area and for the<br /><br />
recovery of Pre-Contract Costs incurred and not yet recovered by CUCBM<br /><br />
in respect of the Contract Area.. The "investment recovery CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons" shall also be used for the recovery of the<br /><br />
development costs in respect of the CBM Field itself which have been<br /><br />
incurred but not yet recovered by CUCBM and the Contractor in<br /><br />
accordance with Articles 12.2.2 and 12.2.3 hereof, and Deemed Interest<br /><br />
thereon. The method of recovery and the recovery sequence are as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Beginning in the Calendar Year during which the production of<br /><br />
any CBM Field within the Contract Area commences, the<br /><br />
"investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" referred to<br /><br />
in Article 13.2.2.2 herein, based on the price which has been<br /><br />
determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof, shall be paid<br /><br />
in kind simultaneously on a 50% - 50% basis to the Contractor<br /><br />
for the recovery of the exploration costs which have been<br /><br />
incurred<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
in respect of, but have not yet been recovered from, the<br /><br />
Contract Area and to CUCBM for the recovery of Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Costs which have been incurred in respect of, but have not yet<br /><br />
been recovered from, the Contract Area. If CUCBM recovers its<br /><br />
Pre-Contract Costs prior to Contractor's recovery of its<br /><br />
exploration costs, that portion of the "investment recovery<br /><br />
CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" previously paid to CUCBM shall<br /><br />
then be paid to Contractor for the cost recovery of<br /><br />
Contractor's unrecovered exploration costs.<br /><br />
The total amount of Pre-Contract Costs that can be recovered<br /><br />
by CUCBM under this Article 13.2.2.2(a) from all CBM Fields in<br /><br />
the Contract Area during the recovery of exploration costs<br /><br />
shall be Two Million Eight Hundred Forty Thousand U.S. dollars<br /><br />
(US$2,840,000).<br /><br />
The unrecovered exploration costs and the unrecovered<br /><br />
Pre-Contract Costs shall be carried forward to and recovered<br /><br />
from the "investment recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" in<br /><br />
succeeding Calendar Years until fully recovered by the<br /><br />
Contractor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Beginning in the Calendar Year during which the exploration<br /><br />
costs incurred by the Contractor and the Pre-Contract Costs<br /><br />
incurred by CUCBM in respect of the Contract Area have been<br /><br />
fully recovered, the remainder of the "investment recovery CBM<br /><br />
and Liquid Hydrocarbons" of a CBM Field shall be used for the<br /><br />
simultaneous recovery of the development costs incurred and<br /><br />
not yet recovered respectively by CUCBM and the Contractor and<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon in respect of such CBM Field in<br /><br />
proportion to their respective participating interests therein<br /><br />
<br /><br />
based on the price of such remainder of the "investment<br /><br />
recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" determined in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 14 hereof. The unrecovered development costs and<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon shall be carried forward to and<br /><br />
recovered from the "investment recovery CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons" in succeeding Calendar Years until fully<br /><br />
recovered.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the production period of a CBM Field, costs for an<br /><br />
additional development project incurred pursuant to Article<br /><br />
11.9 hereof and Deemed Interest thereon shall be recovered<br /><br />
together with the unrecovered development costs and Deemed<br /><br />
Interest thereon. If the development costs and Deemed Interest<br /><br />
thereon have been fully recovered, then costs for the said<br /><br />
additional development project and Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
shall be recovered from the "investment recovery CBM and<br /><br />
Liquid Hydrocarbons" of such CBM Field referred to in Article<br /><br />
13.2.2.2 herein in accordance with the provisions specified in<br /><br />
Article 13.2 herein. The unrecovered costs for the additional<br /><br />
development project and Deemed Interest thereon shall be<br /><br />
carried forward to and recovered in succeeding Calendar Years<br /><br />
until fully recovered.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
After the recovery of a CBM Field's development costs and<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon and/or costs for the additional<br /><br />
development project and Deemed Interest thereon from the said<br /><br />
CBM Field by the Parties, the remainder of the "investment<br /><br />
recovery CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" shall automatically be<br /><br />
regarded as part of the "remainder CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons" referred to in Article 13.2.3 herein. By the<br /><br />
date of expiration of the production period of a CBM Field<br /><br />
pursuant to Article 4.5 hereof, if any development costs and<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon and/or costs for the additional<br /><br />
development project incurred in respect of such CBM Field and<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon have not yet been fully recovered,<br /><br />
then such unrecovered costs and Deemed Interest thereon shall<br /><br />
be regarded as a loss, and the Parties shall bear the loss in<br /><br />
proportion to their respective participating interests.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The remainder of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons after the allocation referred to in Articles 13.2.1 and<br /><br />
13.2.2 herein shall be deemed as "remainder CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons". Such "remainder CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" shall be<br /><br />
divided into "share CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" of the Chinese side<br /><br />
and "allocable remainder CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons". The "allocable<br /><br />
remainder CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons" of each CBM Field in each<br /><br />
Calendar Year shall be equal to the "remainder CBM and Liquid<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons" of that Calendar Year multiplied by the factor (X) for<br /><br />
each CBM Field within the Contract Area in that Calendar Year. The<br /><br />
factor (X) of each CBM Field in each Calendar Year shall be determined<br /><br />
in accordance with the following successive incremental tiers on the<br /><br />
basis of the Annual Gross Production of CBM and Liquid Hydrocarbons<br /><br />

GENERAL PROVISIONS<br /><br />
1.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Accounting Procedure is an integral part of the Contract.<br /><br />
The definitions set forth in Article 1 of the Contract are equally<br /><br />
applicable to this Accounting Procedure. The definitions and provisions of<br /><br />
this Accounting Procedure shall have the same force and effect as those in<br /><br />

conflict with those in the Contract, the provisions in the Contract shall<br /><br />
prevail.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Purpose: The purpose of this Accounting Procedure is to establish<br /><br />
equitable control methods for determining charges and credits applicable<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to the CBM Operations according to the relevant provisions of the<br /><br />
Contract, including the guidelines for accounting settlements in respect<br /><br />
of managing funds and materials, financing and Accounting Records, and for<br /><br />
compiling accounting statements.<br /><br />
The Operator shall neither gain nor lose in relation to the other Parties<br /><br />
to the Contract by means of the fact that it acts as the Operator.<br /><br />
1.3<br /><br />

used in this Accounting Procedure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

buying and selling rates of exchange applicable to any individual or<br /><br />
commercial entity quoted by the People's Bank of China at 11:00 a.m. on<br /><br />
the date of receipt of such cash in the Operator's bank account(s). If the<br /><br />
relevant date is a non-business day of the People's Bank of China, the<br /><br />
rate quoted on the previous business day by the People's Bank of China<br /><br />
shall apply.<br /><br />

Renminbi shall be translated into and recorded in U.S. dollars at the rate<br /><br />
of exchange as quoted above on the last business day of the previous<br /><br />
month, while those transactions which are made in currencies other than<br /><br />
Renminbi and U.S. Dollars shall be recorded in U.S. dollars at the actual<br /><br />
cost in U.S. dollars of effecting the transaction.<br /><br />
Neither CUCBM nor the companies comprising the Contractor shall experience<br /><br />
an exchange gain or loss, at the expense or benefit of the other Party.<br /><br />
The Operator shall make its best efforts to minimize any exchange loss.<br /><br />
All gains or losses from currency conversion or translation shall be<br /><br />
recorded in the Joint Account.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
3.2.1 According to the needs of the CBM Operations, the Operator shall regularly<br /><br />
issue monthly cash call notices within the amount of approved annual<br /><br />
budget to request each Investing Party to respectively make advances as<br /><br />
specified by the Operator. The Operator shall, at least twenty (20) days<br /><br />
prior to the commencement of each month, issue cash call notices for the<br /><br />
development costs and each Investing Party shall provide its percentage<br /><br />
share of funds according to the requirements and within the time limit<br /><br />
specified in the cash call notice. However, the payment due date specified<br /><br />

of the month for which cash is called. Each Investing Party shall transfer<br /><br />
its percentage share of funds to the Operator's bank account(s)<br /><br />
established by the Operator particularly for the CBM Operations. Such bank<br /><br />
account(s) will be interest bearing account(s), if possible. Such interest<br /><br />

In case the Operator, owing to the needs of the Development Operations,<br /><br />
has to incur expenditures which are unforeseen in the cash call for any<br /><br />
month, written notices shall be issued to all the Investing Parties who<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall finance their own shares for the additional amount within ten (10)<br /><br />
days following the receipt of the written notice.<br /><br />
3.2.2 Interest shall be paid by CUCBM or the companies comprising Contractor<br /><br />
failing to pay its share of funds on the due date specified in the cash<br /><br />
call at LIBOR on the delinquent date plus five percent (5%) for a<br /><br />
delinquency of less than one (1) month and thereafter at the average LIBOR<br /><br />
rate ruling throughout each subsequent month plus five percent (5%), such<br /><br />
interest being compounded on a monthly basis throughout the period of the<br /><br />
delinquency. The non-defaulting party or parties shall make up the<br /><br />
delinquent portion on behalf of the defaulting party or parties. When the<br /><br />
defaulting party or parties pay cash to meet both the delinquent portion<br /><br />
and accrued interest thereon, the Operator shall reimburse the<br /><br />
non-defaulting party or parties who made up the delinquent portion.<br /><br />
All amounts advanced by the non-defaulting party or parties plus accrued<br /><br />
interest not reimbursed by the defaulting party shall constitute a debt<br /><br />
due from the defaulting party or parties to the non-defaulting party or<br /><br />
parties who shall be entitled to all remedies at law and equity. The<br /><br />
Operator, or any non-defaulting party, if the Operator is a defaulting<br /><br />
party, on behalf of the non-defaulting party or parties is entitled to<br /><br />
take and sell the defaulting party's or parties' share of the Annual Gross<br /><br />
Production of CBM, Liquid Hydrocarbons and CBM Products and apply the<br /><br />
proceeds of the sale of such CBM, Liquid Hydrocarbons and CBM Products<br /><br />
against all sums due and payable by the defaulting party or parties<br /><br />
including accrued interest. Any excess funds remaining from such proceeds<br /><br />
after deduction of all amounts due, including interest and the costs,<br /><br />
charges and expenses incurred by the Operator, or any non-defaulting<br /><br />
party, if the Operator is a defaulting party, in connection with such<br /><br />
sale, shall be paid over to the defaulting party. Any deficiency remaining<br /><br />
due after deducting the proceeds of any such sale shall remain an<br /><br />
obligation of the defaulting party or parties and may be collected as any<br /><br />
other debt.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The cash for the Production Operations undertaken by the Parties jointly<br /><br />
and approved by JMC shall be provided by all the Investing Parties to the<br /><br />
Contract in proportion to their respective participating interests in the<br /><br />
development costs and shall bear no Deemed Interest. Based on the needs of<br /><br />
the Production Operations, the Operator may make timely adjustment of the<br /><br />
amount of cash to be provided by all the Investing Parties to the<br /><br />
Contract. The Operator shall issue monthly cash call notices for cash for<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Production Operations. In proportion to its share, each Investing<br /><br />
Party shall respectively provide advances on a monthly basis in accordance<br /><br />
with the requirements and within the time limit specified in the cash call<br /><br />
notice of the current month. The default provision specified in Article<br /><br />

3.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
According to the requirement of the CBM Operations, the Operator shall<br /><br />
indicate in any cash call notice the U.S. dollar equivalent of the total<br /><br />
cash called. The Operator shall also specify the amounts of Renminbi and<br /><br />
U.S. dollars required as estimated to make payment. CUCBM shall provide<br /><br />
the advance of its own share either in Renminbi or in Renminbi and U.S.<br /><br />
dollars with respect to the amounts called for by the Operator, but<br /><br />
CUCBM's funding in Renminbi shall not exceed the total amount of Renminbi<br /><br />
as indicated and called for by the Operator in any cash call notice. The<br /><br />
Contractor shall provide the advance of its own share in U. S. dollars.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
3.7.1 Funds for exploration costs, development costs and operating costs, when<br /><br />
received, pursuant to each cash call shall be credited against the<br /><br />
relevant accounts of the Investing Parties in the Joint Account.<br /><br />
3.7.2 In case CUCBM decides to develop a CBM Field for its sole account pursuant<br /><br />
to Article 11.5 of the Contract, or undertakes any other operation for its<br /><br />
sole account, the funds required shall be financed and accounted for<br /><br />
separately.<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
3.7.3 In accordance with Article 6.3 of the Contract, if the Contractor opts to<br /><br />
terminate the Contract as provided in Article 6.3(c) of the Contract or if<br /><br />
the phase is the last phase of the exploration period, the Contractor<br /><br />
shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of its decision to terminate<br /><br />
the Contract or thirty (30) days from the date of the expiration of the<br /><br />
exploration period, pay CUCBM in U.S. dollars the unfulfilled balance of<br /><br />
the minimum exploration work commitment (or of the new commitment) for the<br /><br />
exploration phase, converted into cash. The detailed method by which the<br /><br />
unfulfilled balance of the minimum exploration work commitment is<br /><br />
converted into U.S. dollars is that the actual average unit cost of the<br /><br />
last portion of a seismic line shot under the Contract or of the last well<br /><br />
drilled, excluding the abnormal drilling costs such as those of the<br /><br />
sidetrack, fishing, severe loss of mud circulation, etc. (i.e. U.S.<br /><br />
dollars/kilometer of seismic line; U.S. dollars/meter of drilling<br /><br />
footage), is multiplied by the unfulfilled amount of the minimum<br /><br />
exploration work commitment. The formula for such calculation is as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
I = Ac x Pu<br /><br />
in which:<br /><br />
I = converted cash amount of the unfulfilled balance of the minimum<br /><br />
exploration work commitment;<br /><br />
Ac = actual average unit cost of the last portion of a seismic line shot<br /><br />
or of the last well drilled; and<br /><br />
Pu = the unfulfilled amount of the minimum exploration work commitment<br /><br />
(The unfulfilled amount of the seismic line shot is the difference between<br /><br />
the kilometers specified in Article 6.2 of the Contract and actual<br /><br />
kilometers shot. The unfulfilled footage of an unfulfilled Wildcat is the<br /><br />
designed total depth of the Wildcat specified in accordance with Article<br /><br />
6.2 of the Contract or the depth actually drilled).<br /><br />

The overhead rates for the Development Operations shall be agreed upon by<br /><br />
the Parties through discussions at the time when the development budget<br /><br />
is being prepared.<br /><br />
When the first budget is prepared for the Calendar Year of Commencement<br /><br />
of Commercial Production from each CBM Field, the overhead rates for<br /><br />
production period and its related calculation method shall be agreed upon<br /><br />
through discussions between the Parties.<br /><br />
The costs and expenses for offices established by the Operator within the<br /><br />
Chinese territory which are not specifically dedicated to the CBM<br /><br />
Operations shall be allocated by the Operator to the CBM Operations<br /><br />
within the Contract Area or to other beneficiary Parties, including the<br /><br />
Contractor, on the basis of actual service time recorded, or may be<br /><br />
allocated by other methods agreed upon by the Parties. The amount of<br /><br />
allocation charged to the CBM Operations within the Contract Area shall<br /><br />
be included in the cost item of Article 5.2.18 of this Accounting<br /><br />
Procedure. The costs and expenses incurred by the offices established by<br /><br />
the Operator and its superior organizations outside the Chinese territory<br /><br />

calculated on the basis of cumulative actual expenditure for the Calendar<br /><br />
Year to that date and payment shall be made from the Joint Account on the<br /><br />
last working day of the following month. The final adjustment of the<br /><br />
overhead shall be made at the end of the Calendar Year in respect to any<br /><br />
difference between the actual payment by the Joint Account and the total<br /><br />
overhead for that Calendar Year calculated on the basis of the annual<br /><br />
cumulative actual investment expenditure at the end of such year. Any<br /><br />
excess shall be refunded and deficiencies made good.<br /><br />

right of the Contract Area and CBM mining right of the Development Area<br /><br />
within the Contract Area, and which shall be respectively considered as<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the exploration costs and development costs (or operating costs). The<br /><br />
Contractor shall transfer the specified fee to the bank account of CUCBM<br /><br />
within thirty days from the date on receipt of the written notice for the<br /><br />
payments of the exploration right fee or mining right fee from CUCBM. The<br /><br />

<br /><br />
With respect to the expenditures or excess expenditures under Article<br /><br />
10.2.4 (b) of the Contract which are determined by JMC to be<br /><br />
unreasonable, JMC will form a joint team for further investigation to<br /><br />
determine whether they shall be charged to the Joint Account or shall be<br /><br />
borne by the Operator alone before the year-end final closing of<br /><br />
accounts.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARTICLE 6<br /><br />
RECOVERY OF COSTS AND DEEMED INTEREST<br /><br />
6.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
According to the provisions of Article 12.2.2 of the Contract, the<br /><br />
exploration costs incurred by Contractor and the Pre-Contract Costs<br /><br />
incurred by CUCBM in respect to the Contract Area shall bear no interest.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The calculation of Deemed Interest on the development costs:<br /><br />
Deemed Interest on the development costs shall be calculated at the<br /><br />
specified rate from the first day after the month in which the<br /><br />
development funds of any of the Investing Parties have been received in<br /><br />
the Operator's bank account for the Joint Account in accordance with the<br /><br />
provisions of Article 12.2.3.2 of the Contract.<br /><br />
There are three hundred and sixty-five (365) days in each Calendar Year<br /><br />
for the purposes of interest calculation and the interest shall be<br /><br />
compounded once each Calendar Year on December 31st based on actual<br /><br />
number of days eligible for the interest.<br /><br />
Worked Example<br /><br />
Development costs-- US $100 received on tenth of March<br /><br />
US $100 received on twentieth of March<br /><br />
The aggregate amount received in March is US $200.<br /><br />
Deemed interest shall be calculated from the first of April through the<br /><br />
end of such Calendar Year with a total number of two hundred and<br /><br />
seventy-five (275) days.<br /><br />
275<br /><br />
Formula: Interest = US $200 X 9% X ------------365<br /><br />
At the end of the year interest is added to the capital and interest<br /><br />
thereon accrues until cost recovery is fully achieved, "i.e.," interest<br /><br />
is compounded at year end.<br /><br />
