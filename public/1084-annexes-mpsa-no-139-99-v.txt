Subsequent                    <br>raises are advanced towards the x-cut at intervals of 9 m                <br>or a total of 6 raises each heading. Ideally, these raises               <br>are cribbed with ladder provision at the manway side                     <br>for access of mines to the stope. As both vein (generally                <br>siliceous) and country rock (granodiorite) are generally                 <br>strong separated by distinct walls, the vein section is                  <br>blasted/extracted first and followed by the waste                        <br>portion. The ore is mucked into the chute and                         <br>subsequently broken waste is used to fill the open stope.                <br>The faces are maintained in stepped pattern for                         <br>effective blasting of the ore and waste. In most                          <br>instances, broken ore can be immediately shoveled into                   <br>chute as the waste material next broken is just enough                  <br>to fill the stope and serves as platform for miners to                   <br>drill the next round. Raises are built up periodically to                <br>maintain their tops at level with the filling. Sloping is               <br>carried out close to the next level above leaving only a                 <br>thin pillar below the upper timbered level. Mining                       <br>progress upward to the next level after the 3-veins in                  <br>the lower most level are extracted. A 5-m wide shaft<br>pillar on both sides will be left behind. <br><br><br />

Ana and San Antonio area vein system lies at the western of the          <br>Paracale Granodiorite intrusive emplaced upon an undifferentiated Jurassic<br>metamorphic sequence. For all practical purposes these two (2) lithologies are   <br>the only important rock units in the district. <br><br>This sequence occurs all around the Paracale, Jose Panganiban peninsula and      <br>consist mostly of serpentinized periodotities and some minor talc and chlorite   <br>schists. The ultramafic accounts for about 60% of the complex, and has been      <br>completely altered into serpentinities. There has yet been no study done to      <br>determine if this ultramafic body represent an opliolile series or not.          <br><br>The talc and chlorite schists arebelieved to have been derived from the         <br>diabasic components of the Early Miocene Universal Shale Formation, which        <br>outcrops to the south of the granodiorite.                                       <br><br>The Paracale granodiorite is an ovoid intrusive measuring some 12 kilometers     <br>by 4 kilometers, it is emplaced in a west north west orientation with the        <br>western end at the town of Jose Panganiban. It is composed mainly K-             <br>feldspar, quartz and biotite. It has a generally uniform composition all        <br>throughout.                                                                      <br><br>The presence of a core and marginal phase, the elongation in a west-north       <br>west direction together with the development of fractures perpendicular to this  <br>axis of elongation has implied a certain mode of emplacement for the Paracale    <br>granodiorite.<br><br>To account for the observed features of the stock, Gardner (1941) proposes a     <br>mode of emplacement involving intrusion of the stock under an active            <br>northest trending major stress axis. This will cause the stock to flow and be    <br>elongated in response to this stress axis, and that is to flow in a west - nort  <br>west direction. Wisser (1939) opines that the presence of the northeast          <br>trending major stress axis is not necessary. He appeals to a passive influence    <br>for the emplacement by suggesting that the stock flowed in the west-north        <br>west direction because that is the path of least resistance - the schistocity of <br>the metamorphic complex being in that orientation.                              <br><br>The main vein systems:                                                           <br><br>The Sta. Ana and Sta. Ana East vein are gold bearing cross joints located near   <br>the western contact of the stock. The major vein systems are:                    <br><br>1.    Sta. Ana Main Vein                                                         <br>2.    Sta. Ana East                                                              <br>3.    Tacoma 3<br><br><br />
In addition to the above three main veins, two secondary veins system were                 <br>also worked and these are:                                                                 <br><br>1.

They are more or less along the                           <br>direction of the Sta/Ana vein's strike. Portal of shaft-1 is at 160                 <br>m while shaft-2 collar is at 150 m. The former shaft is collared                    <br>at the hanging wall, side of Sta. Ana vein, the latter is at the                    <br>immediate foot well of the same vein. Both shafts will be                          <br>driven vertically to L-100 and consequently openings will                           <br>attain total depths of 94 m and 84 m respectively, normal depth                     <br>of sumps included. Subsequent cross- cuts will be driven                           <br>easterly and westerly emanating from the shafts and will be                         <br>driven to cut the closely- lying 3 parallel veins.

Maximum drift length will be                    <br>at 60 m measured from the x-cuts or a combined length of 120<br>m. per drift or 360 m per level. Upon completion of the                            <br>uppermost set of x-cuts and levels, main openings (shafts) will                     <br>be deepened to the second level at "0" level.

During actual production, each slope                <br>raise will have an influence width of 9 meters along plane of               <br>vein. As earlier mentioned under mining method, faces of slope              <br>will be stepped-back for effective ore and waste breaking. To               <br>establish this pattern, the farthest raise (# 1) is initially               <br>advanced for 6 m ht., (# 2) for 4.5 m, (# 3) for 3 m and (# 4) for<br><br><br><br><br />
1.5 m. The intervening ore between these raises is                          <br>consequently drilled and blasted to form the initial cut stoping            <br>is likewise- carried out in the adjoining shaft, same vein                  <br>extension of the same level. This will result to 4 stope raises             <br>per shaft or 8 slope raises in 2 shafts being worked                        <br>simultaneously per day.                                                    <br><br>Ore ranging in thickness from 0.77 - .85 m will be blasted                  <br>ahead of the country rock to avoid dilution and sorting. Broken            <br>ore is shoveled unto chutes before blasting the waste portion.              <br>Muck or waste will lie used for filling mined-out sections and              <br>will serve as platform for miners.                                          <br><br>In ore zone, interval of holes is 0.45 m. In a 9 m wide section,           <br>60 holes per round is required. In rock, 20 holes.                          <br><br>Estimated advance of stope face is 1.52 m. Tonnage ore per                  <br>round is 0.60 x 9 x 1.52 x 2.67 (thick x length x depth x sp. gr.)          <br>or 20 mt/blast. To attain a minimum stope width of 1.52 m,                  <br>after ore extraction, it is necessary to blast 0.67 m of rock.              <br><br>Tonnage of waste is 0.67 x 9 x 1.52 x 2.5 or 22 nit per round.              <br><br>Conservatively, a round in ore per day per shaft with 4 slope               <br>raises each will produce 60 mt, in 2 shafts. One hundred twenty             <br>(120) mt per day production is attainable.                                  <br><br>2.8.2    Estimated period of extraction per vein (drift) per level: At L-   <br>100 N & L-100 S, Sta.
