RECOVERY OF OPERATING COSTS AND SHARING OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1 The allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be calculated on a Contract Area basis for Royalty Oil, Cost<br /><br />
Oil and Profit Oil. The allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be in accordance with the Accounting<br /><br />
Procedures, the Allocation and Lifting Procedures and this clause 10 as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Royalty Oil shall be allocated to the State from the first day of Production, based on the daily total<br /><br />
of Available Crude Oil from a Contract Area, set at a rate of 2% (two percent);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be allocated to the Contractor in such quantum as will generate an amount of Proceeds<br /><br />
sufficient for recovery of Operating Costs in each Contract Area. All costs will be recovered in<br /><br />
United States dollars through Cost Oil allocation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be not more than 80% (eighty percent) of Available Crude Oil in each Contract Area<br /><br />
less deduction of Royalty Oil in any accounting period;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Profit Oil, being the balance of Available Crude Oil after deducting Royalty Oil and Cost Oil, shall<br /><br />
be allocated to each Party based on the before-tax, nominal rate of return calculated on a quarterly<br /><br />
basis for the Contract Area in accordance with the following sliding scale:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor’s Rate of Return for<br /><br />

<br /><br />
10.2 Beginning at the date of Commercial Discovery, the Contractor’s rate of return shall be determined at the<br /><br />
end of each Quarter on the basis of the accumulated compounded net cash flow for each Contract Area,<br /><br />
using the following procedure:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Contractor’s net cash flow for a Contract Area for each Quarter is:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(i) The result of the sum of the Contractor’s Cost Oil and the share of Profit Oil of the Contract Area regarding<br /><br />
Petroleum actually lifted in that Quarter at the Realizable Price;<br /><br />
(ii) Minus Operating Costs;<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For this computation, it shall not be included in the calculation of a Contractor’s net cash flow<br /><br />
neither any expense made before the date of Commercial Discovery for a Contract Area nor any<br /><br />
Exploration Cost.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s net cash flows for each Quarter are compounded and accumulated for a Contract<br /><br />
Area beginning at the date of Commercial Discovery according to the following formula:<br /><br />
ACNCF (Current Quarter) =<br /><br />
(100% + DQ x ACNCF (Previous Quarter) + NCF (Current Quarter) 100%<br /><br />
where:<br /><br />
ACNCF = accumulated compounded net cash flow<br /><br />
NCF = net cash flow<br /><br />
DQ = quarterly compound rate (in percent)<br /><br />
The calculation will be made using quarterly compound rates (in percent) of 4.44%, 5.09%, 5.95%,<br /><br />
and 6.57%, which correspond to annual compound rates (“DA”) of 19%, 22%, 26%, and 29%,<br /><br />
respectively.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s rate of return in any given Quarter for a Contract Area shall be deemed to be<br /><br />
between the largest DA which yields a positive or zero ACNCF and the smallest DA which causes<br /><br />
the ACNCF to be negative.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The sharing of Profit Oil from a Contract Area between the State and the Contractor in a given<br /><br />
Quarter shall be in accordance with the scale in clause 10.1, paragraph (d) above using the<br /><br />
Contractor’s deemed rate of return as per paragraph (c) in the immediately preceding Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In a given Contract Area, it is possible for the Contractor’s deemed rate of return to decline as a<br /><br />
result of negative cash flow in a Quarter with the consequence that Contractor’s share of Profit Oil<br /><br />
<br /><br />
from that Contract Area would increase in the subsequent Quarter.<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pending finalization of accounts, Profit Oil from the Contract Area shall be shared on the basis of<br /><br />
provisional estimates, if necessary, of a deemed rate of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
<br /><br />
return as approved by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo. Adjustments shall be effected with the<br /><br />
procedure subsequently to be adopted by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
10.3 The quantum of Available Crude Oil to be allocated to each Party under this Contract shall be determined<br /><br />
at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
10.4 Each Party shall lift and dispose of Available Crude Oil in accordance with the Allocation and Lifting<br /><br />
Procedures as provided in Schedule 3. In the event of any reconciliation, the records of the Agência<br /><br />
Nacional do Petróleo shall be the official, final and binding records.<br /><br />
10.5 Allocation of Royalty Oil and Profit Oil shall be in the form of delivery of Production of Petroleum to the<br /><br />
Agência Nacional do Petróleo. The Agência Nacional do Petróleo or other appropriate authority shall issue<br /><br />
receipts for such delivery within 30 (thirty) days of lifting such Royalty Oil and Profit Oil. These receipts<br /><br />
are issued by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo or other appropriate authority on behalf of the<br /><br />
Government of Sao Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
10.6 Any Party may, at the request of any other Party, lift such other Party’s Available Crude Oil, pursuant to<br /><br />
clause 10.3, and the lifting Party, within 30 (thirty) days, shall transfer to the account of the non-lifting<br /><br />
Party the Proceeds of the sale to which the non-lifting Party is entitled. Overdue payments shall bear<br /><br />
interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2% (two percent).<br /><br />
10.7 The State may sell to the Contractor all or any portion of its allocation of Available Crude Oil from the<br /><br />
Contract Area at the Realizable Price under mutually agreed terms and conditions.<br /><br />
10.8 The parties shall meet as and when agreed in the Allocation and Lifting Procedures to reconcile all<br /><br />
Petroleum produced, allocated and lifted during the period in accordance with the Allocation and Lifting<br /><br />
Procedures set forth in Schedule 3.<br /><br />
10.9 Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of lifting the State's Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil, the State may elect to<br /><br />
receive the State’s allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil in cash based on the Realizable Price rather<br /><br />
than through lifting, regardless of whether or not the Contractor sells the State's Profit Oil and/or Royalty<br /><br />
Oil to a third party. This option shall be exercised upon 180 (one hundred eighty) days advance notice<br /><br />
issued by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo to the Operator. If the State elects to receive cash in lieu of<br /><br />
lifting, the Operator shall lift the State's allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil and pay into the<br /><br />
National Petroleum Account cash in respect of such lifting within 30 (thirty ) days from the last day of the<br /><br />
month in which the lifting occurred. Every 6 (six) months, the State may elect to have an entity designated<br /><br />
by the State to resume lifting the State’s allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil, upon 180 (one<br /><br />
hundred eighty) days notice to the Operator, prior to the date the State elects to have an entity, designated<br /><br />
by the State, to resume lifting.<br /><br />
11.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.1 Save as otherwise provided in this Contract, Crude Oil Production shall be valued in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
<br /><br />
accordance with the following procedures:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On the attainment of commercial production of Crude Oil, each Party shall engage the services of an<br /><br />
independent laboratory of good repute to undertake a qualitative and quantitative analysis of such<br /><br />
Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Once a trial marketing period is designated which shall extend for the first 6 (six) month period<br /><br />
during which such new stream is lifted or for the period of time required for the first 10 (ten)<br /><br />
liftings, whichever is longer. During the trial marketing period the Parties shall:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
collect samples of the new Crude Oil upon which the qualitative and quantitative analysis<br /><br />
shall be performed as provided in clause 11.1(a);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
determine the approximate quality of the new Crude Oil by estimating the yield values from<br /><br />
refinery modeling;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii) market the new Crude Oil to which they are entitled and the other Party’s allocation of<br /><br />
Available Crude Oil they may be entitled to lift, and payments therefore shall be made by the<br /><br />
buyers to the Operator who will be responsible for its distribution to the other Parties in<br /><br />
accordance with their entitlement; Cost Oil and Profit Oil and the Contractor's accounting<br /><br />
shall reflect such revenues, in accordance with clause 10;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provide information to a third party who shall compile the information and maintain all<br /><br />
individual Party information confidential, with regard to the marketing of the new Crude Oil,<br /><br />
including documents which verify the sales price and terms of each lifting; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
apply the actual F.O.B. sales price to determine the value for each lifting which F.O.B. sales<br /><br />
pricing for each lifting shall continue, as the Realizable Price, after the trial marketing period<br /><br />
until the Parties agree to a valuation of the new Crude Oil but in no event longer than 90<br /><br />
(ninety) days after conclusion of the trial marketing period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As soon as practicable but in any event not later than 60 (sixty) days after the end of the trial<br /><br />
marketing period, the Parties shall meet to review the qualitative and quantitative analysis, yield and<br /><br />
actual sales data. Each Party may present a proposal for the valuation of the new Crude Oil. A<br /><br />
valuation formula for the Realizable Price shall be agreed to by the Parties not later than 9 (nine)<br /><br />
months after the first lifting. It is the intent of the Parties that such prices shall reflect the true market<br /><br />
value based on arm’s length transactions for the sale of the new Crude Oil. The valuation formula, as<br /><br />
determined hereinbefore (including the product yield values), shall be mutually agreed within 30<br /><br />
(thirty) days of the aforementioned meeting. In the absence of an agreement, it shall be referred to a<br /><br />
mutually agreed independent expert who shall have the appropriate international oil and gas<br /><br />
experience and who will<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<br /><br />
resolve and settle the matter in a manner as he shall in his absolute discretion think fit and the<br /><br />
decision of the expert shall be final and binding on the Parties. If, after a period of 30 (thirty) days,<br /><br />
the Parties are unable to agree on the identity of the expert, such expert shall be appointed by the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the provisions for the appointment of experts<br /><br />
under the Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon the conclusion of the trial marketing period, the Parties shall be entitled to lift their allocation<br /><br />
of Available Crude Oil pursuant to clause 10.3 and the Allocation and Lifting Procedures set forth in<br /><br />
Schedule 3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a new Crude Oil stream is produced from the Contract Area and is commingled with an<br /><br />
existing Crude Oil produced, which has an established Realizable Price basis, then such basis shall<br /><br />
be applied to the extent practicable for determining the Realizable Price of the new Crude Oil. The<br /><br />
Parties shall meet and mutually agree on any appropriate modifications to such established valuation<br /><br />
basis, which may be required to reflect any change in the market value of the Crude Oils as a result<br /><br />
of commingling.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.2 If, in the opinion of either the Agência Nacional do Petróleo or the Contractor, an agreed price valuation<br /><br />
method fails to reflect the market value of Crude Oil produced in the Contract Area, then such Party may<br /><br />
propose to the other Party modifications to such valuation method once in every 6 (six) months but in no<br /><br />
event more than twice in any Calendar Year. The Parties shall then meet within 30 (thirty) days of such<br /><br />
proposal and mutually agree on any modifications to such valuation within 30 (thirty) days from such<br /><br />
meeting. In the absence of an agreement, the issue shall be referred to a mutually agreed independent<br /><br />
expert who shall have the appropriate international oil and gas experience and who will resolve and settle<br /><br />
the matter in a manner as he shall in his absolute discretion think fit and the decision of the expert shall be<br /><br />
final and binding on the Parties. If after a period of 30 (thirty) days, the Parties are unable to agree on the<br /><br />
identity of the expert, such expert shall be appointed by the International Centre for Expertise in<br /><br />
accordance with the provisions for the appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the<br /><br />
International Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
11.3 Segregation of Crude Oils of different quality and/or grade shall, by agreement of the Parties, take into<br /><br />
consideration, among other things, the operational practicality of segregation and the cost benefit analysis<br /><br />
thereof. If the Parties agree on such segregation the following provisions shall apply:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any and all provisions of this Contract concerning valuation of Crude Oil shall separately apply to<br /><br />
each segregated Crude Oil produced; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
each grade or quality of Crude Oil produced and segregated in a given year shall contribute its<br /><br />
proportionate share to the total quantity designated in such year as Royalty Oil, Cost Oil and Profit<br /><br />
Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PAYMENTS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1 The Contractor shall make all payments to the State, for which it is liable under this Contract, in United<br /><br />
States dollars or such other currency agreed between the Contractor and the Agência Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
Payments shall be made into the National Petroleum Account in accordance with the Oil Revenue Law.<br /><br />
Where a<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
payment is made in currency other than United States dollars, the exchange rate used to convert the<br /><br />
liability from United States dollars into that currency shall be the exchange rate published on the date of<br /><br />
payment by the Central Bank of Sao Tome and Principe for dobras and by the Financial Times of London<br /><br />
for other currencies. Overdue payments shall bear interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 2% (two<br /><br />
percent) from the due date until the date of actual payment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2 The State shall make all payments to the Contractor for which it is liable under this Contract in United<br /><br />
States dollars or such other currency agreed between the Contractor and the Agência Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
Where a payment is made in a currency other than United States dollars, the exchange rate used to convert<br /><br />
the liability from United States dollar into that currency shall be the exchange rate published on the date of<br /><br />
payment by the Central Bank of Sao Tome and Principe for dobras, and the Financial Times of London for<br /><br />
other currencies. Overdue payments shall bear interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus 2% (two percent)<br /><br />
from the due date until the date of actual payment.<br /><br />
12.3 Any payments required to be made pursuant to this Contract shall be made within 30 (thirty) days<br /><br />
following the last day of the month in which the obligation to make such payments is incurred.<br /><br />
13.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
TITLE TO EQUIPMENT / DECOMMISSIONING<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.1 The Contractor shall finance the cost of purchasing or leasing all materials, equipment and facilities to be<br /><br />
used in Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area pursuant to approved Work Programs and Budgets and<br /><br />
such materials, equipment and facilities, if purchased, shall become the sole property of the State, free of<br /><br />
all liens and other encumbrances, when the Contractor has recovered the cost of such materials, equipment<br /><br />
and facilities (as the case may be) in accordance with this Contract or upon its termination, whichever<br /><br />
occurs first. Except as otherwise provided for in the Petroleum Law, the Contractor shall have the right to<br /><br />
use, free of any additional charge, all materials, equipment and facilities exclusively for Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations in the Contract Area during the term of this Contract and any extensions thereof. Should the<br /><br />
State or the Agência Nacional do Petróleo desire to use such materials, equipment and facilities outside the<br /><br />
Contract Area, such use shall be subject to terms and conditions to be agreed by the Parties, provided that<br /><br />
it is understood that Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area hereunder shall take precedence over such<br /><br />
use by the State or the Agência Nacional do Petróleo. The Contractor shall only lease materials, equipment<br /><br />
and facilities with the approval of the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, such approval not to be unreasonably<br /><br />
withheld.<br /><br />
13.2 The Contractor’s right to use such purchased materials, equipment and facilities shall cease with the<br /><br />
termination or expiration (whichever is earlier) of this Contract, including any extensions hereof.<br /><br />
13.3 The provisions of clause 13.1, with respect to the title of property passing to the State, shall not apply to<br /><br />
leased equipment belonging to local or foreign third parties, and such equipment may be freely exported<br /><br />
from the Territory of Sao Tome and Principe, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.4 Notwithstanding clause 13.2, all fixed assets purchased or otherwise acquired by the Contractor for the<br /><br />
purposes of Petroleum Operations hereunder, shall become the exclusive property of the State when the<br /><br />
Contractor has recovered the cost of such materials, equipment and facilities (as the case may be) in<br /><br />
accordance with this Contract or upon its termination, whichever occurs first. Upon termination of this<br /><br />
Contract, the Contractor shall hand over possession of such fixed assets to the State in good working order<br /><br />
and free of all liens and other encumbrances.<br /><br />
13.5 During the term of this Contract, any agreed sale of equipment, lands, fixed assets, materials and<br /><br />
machinery acquired for the purpose of Petroleum Operations shall be conducted by the Contractor on the<br /><br />
basis of the procedure for sale of assets as set forth in Schedule 5, subject to the consent of the Agência<br /><br />
Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
13.6 Decommissioning<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The expenditures for Decommissioning will be estimated on the basis of technical studies undertaken by<br /><br />
the Contractor, to be agreed by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, as part of each Field Development<br /><br />
Program and revised as deemed necessary.<br /><br />
13.7 Unless otherwise agreed with the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, the procedure for the Contractor<br /><br />
providing funds to meet its Decommissioning obligations shall be as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
an amount shall be established on a Contract Area basis, commencing upon 4 (four) years after the<br /><br />
commencement of the Production Period, on a unit of production basis as follows:<br /><br />
DP =(PVDC – DF) * (P / RP), where:<br /><br />
DP =Decommissioning provision for the period (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
PVDC =Present Value of Decommissioning costs (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
DF =Balance of Decommissioning fund at the start of the period (millions of US dollars)<br /><br />
P =Crude Oil production in the period (millions of Barrels)<br /><br />
RP =Estimated remaining Crude Oil (millions of Barrels)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All Decommissioning provisions shall be held in a Decommissioning reserve fund which shall be an<br /><br />
interest bearing escrow account jointly established by the Parties at a first class commercial bank or<br /><br />
at another financial institution in accordance with the Petroleum Law. The bank or financial<br /><br />
institution shall have a long term rating of not less than “AA” by Standard and Poor’s Corporation<br /><br />
or an “Aa2” rating by Moody’s Investor Service or an equivalent rating by another mutually agreed<br /><br />
rating service.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purposes of calculating the present value of Decommissioning costs, the following formula<br /><br />
shall be used:<br /><br />
PVDC = EDC / (1 + i) n, where:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PVDC =present value of Decommissioning costs<br /><br />
EDC =estimated value of Decommissioning costs in nominal terms at the expected date of<br /><br />
Decommissioning<br /><br />
i =interest rate applicable to the escrow account in the current period<br /><br />
n =number of Years between current period and expected date of Decommissioning<br /><br />
13.8 The Decommissioning reserve fund shall be used solely for the purposes of paying for Decommissioning<br /><br />
activities. No Party may mortgage, pledge, encumber or otherwise usurp such Decommissioning reserve<br /><br />
fund for any purpose whatsoever, except as expressly provided herein or in the Petroleum Law. The<br /><br />
Decommissioning reserve fund may be invested in investments approved in advance by the Contractor and<br /><br />
the Agência Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
13.9 The Contractor shall annually meet any shortfall between the actual Decommissioning costs and the<br /><br />
Decommissioning reserve fund for any Contract Area, with such amount to be deposited into the escrow<br /><br />
account within 30 (thirty) days after the end of each Calendar Year.<br /><br />
13.10 Any balance remaining in any Decommissioning fund after all Decommissioning costs in the Contract<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Area have been met shall be distributed between the Agência Nacional do Petróleo and the Contractor in<br /><br />
the same proportion as the allocation of Available Crude Oil at the time of Decommissioning operations.<br /><br />
13.11 Decommissioning expenditures incurred under these Decommissioning provisions are cost recoverable as<br /><br />
Contract Area non-capital costs under the Accounting Procedures and deductible for Tax purposes under<br /><br />
the Petroleum Taxation Law.<br /><br />
14.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF NATIONALS OF THE STATE<br /><br />

Good Oil Field Practice with respect to Petroleum Operations with an insurance company of good repute<br /><br />
approved by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, in the names of the Parties and with limits of liability not<br /><br />
less than those required in accordance with Good Oil Field Practice. The premium for such policies shall<br /><br />
be included in Operating Costs. All policies shall name the Agência Nacional do Petróleo as a co-insured<br /><br />
<br /><br />
with a waiver of subrogation rights in favor of the Contractor. Without prejudice to the generality of the<br /><br />
foregoing, such insurance shall cover:<br /><br />

property in question, the Contractor shall immediately take steps to replace or repair such lost or damaged<br /><br />
property. Any excess cost of repair or replacement above the amount reimbursed by the insurance<br /><br />
company shall be regarded as an Operating Cost. If the cost of repair is less than the amount reimbursed<br /><br />
by the insurance company, the difference shall be deducted from Operating Costs. If the decision is to<br /><br />
neither repair nor replace then the proceeds of any coverage shall be credited to Operating Costs. In the<br /><br />
event that the loss or damage is attributable to the Contractor’s negligence or willful misconduct, the<br /><br />
excess cost of replacement or repair shall not be reimbursed as an Operating Cost.<br /><br />

19.2 All changes in Control of a Contractor Party shall be subject to the prior approval of the Government.<br /><br />
Where a change in Control occurs without the prior approval of the Government, the Government may<br /><br />
terminate this Contract in respect of such Contractor Party. This clause 19.2 does not apply if the change<br /><br />
of Control is the direct result of an acquisition of shares or other securities of a publicly traded company<br /><br />
on a recognized stock exchange. Change of Control includes a Person ceasing to be Controlled (whether or<br /><br />
not another Person becomes in Control), and a Person obtaining Control (whether or not another Person<br /><br />
was under Control).<br /><br />
19.3 When an assignment, transfer or other disposition of any rights under this Contract, other than a transfer<br /><br />
pursuant to clause 19.5 is anticipated, the assigning Contractor Party must notify in writing the Agência<br /><br />

obligations and liabilities under this Contract, notwithstanding such assignment, transfer, conveyance or<br /><br />
other disposal. If the Affiliate ceases at any time to be an Affiliate of the transferring Contractor Party, the<br /><br />
Affiliate shall immediately re-assign or re-transfer to the original Contractor Party all rights and<br /><br />
obligations transferred to it under this Contract. Transfers of interests to an Affiliate of a Contractor Party<br /><br />
shall not change the nationality of the Contractor Party for the purpose of determining jurisdiction of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
32<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any arbitration tribunal.<br /><br />
19.6 Any request for consent pursuant to clause 19.1 made by a Contractor to the Agência Nacional do Petróleo<br /><br />

specified in clause 21.1 shall not be deemed an event of Force Majeure.<br /><br />
22.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
LAWS AND REGULATIONS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.1 This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Democratic Republic<br /><br />
of Sao Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
22.2 Subject to clause 25.8 and without prejudice to the principles of public international law, no term of this<br /><br />
Contract, shall prevent or limit the State from exercising its sovereign rights.<br /><br />
23.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.1 If the Contractor discovers a commercially viable quantity of Natural Gas, it shall have the right to<br /><br />
develop, commercialize, recover the costs and share the profits of a development of such Natural Gas<br /><br />
under this Contract on terms to be mutually agreed. Such terms when agreed shall become an integral part<br /><br />
of this Contract.<br /><br />
23.2 Notwithstanding clause 23.1, the Contractor may utilize, at no cost, Natural Gas required as fuel for<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations such as gas recycling, gas injection or any other Crude Oil enhancing recovery<br /><br />
schemes, for the necessary stimulation of wells aimed at the maximum Crude Oil recovery in the field<br /><br />
discovered and developed by the Contractor and such usage shall be with prior written consent of the<br /><br />
Agência Nacional do Petróleo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This shall be included in<br /><br />
a Field Development Program.<br /><br />
23.3 The recovery of Crude Oil through an efficient, economic and technically acceptable method shall always<br /><br />
be paramount in all decisions regarding Associated Natural Gas. However, prior to the commencement of<br /><br />
Production of Crude Oil from the Contract Area, the Contractor shall submit to the Agência Nacional do<br /><br />
Petróleo, a program for the utilization of any Associated Natural Gas that has been discovered in the<br /><br />
Contract Area, which shall be subject to the approval of the Agência Nacional do Petróleo.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
35<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.4 If the Contractor discovers sufficient volumes of Unassociated Natural Gas that could justify commercial<br /><br />
development, the Contractor shall immediately report the volume of potentially recoverable Natural Gas to<br /><br />
the Agência Nacional do Petróleo and shall promptly investigate and submit proposals to the Agência<br /><br />
Nacional do Petróleo for the commercial development of such Natural Gas taking in consideration local<br /><br />
strategic needs as may be identified by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo within 2 (two) years of the date<br /><br />
of the relevant discovery. Any cost in respect of such proposals or investigation presented by the<br /><br />
Contractor to the Agência Nacional do Petróleo shall be included in Operating Costs. The Contractor and<br /><br />
the Agência Nacional do Petróleo will determine the plan and time needed, which shall be no more than 5<br /><br />
(five) years, unless otherwise established by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, to progress a commercial<br /><br />
development project, which shall include the terms for recovery of Operating Costs and sharing of Natural<br /><br />
Gas production, which terms when agreed shall form an integral part of this Contract. If the Contractor<br /><br />
fails to justify a commercial development within the agreed timeframe and if the Agência Nacional do<br /><br />
Petróleo determines that a sufficient volume of Unassociated Natural Gas exists, the Agência Nacional do<br /><br />
Petróleo shall have the right to propose to the Contractor a commercial development of such Natural Gas.<br /><br />
The Contractor shall have the right to participate in the commercial development under the terms provided<br /><br />
for in clause 23.1. If the Contractor declines to participate in the commercial development of such Natural<br /><br />
Gas as presented by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo and if the Field Development Program does not<br /><br />
hinder or jeopardize current Petroleum Operations, the Agência Nacional do Petróleo may develop the<br /><br />
Natural Gas in the manner presented to the Contractor.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
