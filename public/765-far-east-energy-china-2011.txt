Liquid Hydrocarbons transportation and sales agreements, and try to conclude such transactions.<br /><br />
11.4 If JMC unanimously decides that a reserves report will not be prepared for a particular Coalbed Methane Discovery, at<br /><br />
the request of the Contractor, the corresponding area covered by the Coalbed Methane Discovery may be retained in the<br /><br />
Contract Area during the exploration period. However, if, at the expiration of the exploration period, the JMC still<br /><br />
unanimously decides that a reserves report will not be prepared for the aforesaid Coalbed Methane Discovery, the area<br /><br />
covered by such Coalbed Methane Discovery shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
11.5 If the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the exploration period, advises JMC in writing that it will not prepare a<br /><br />
reserves report for a Coalbed Methane Discovery, the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived its rights of participation in<br /><br />
the development of that Coalbed Methane Field, then CUCBM shall have the right to solely develop such potential Coalbed<br /><br />
Methane Field.<br /><br />
Before the expiration of the exploration period, if the Parties do not unanimously approve the compilation of a reserves<br /><br />
report for a particular Coalbed Methane Discovery, Contractor may continue to compile the reserve report in accordance with<br /><br />
Chinese CBM reserves regulations and CUCBM shall assist Contractor to submit the reserve report that meets Chinese<br /><br />
proven reserves standards. Within 30 days of receipt of notice of proven reserves of a Coalbed Methane Field from the<br /><br />
Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China, CUCBM will participate in such development with a<br /><br />
participating interest as provided in Article 2.4 hereof.<br /><br />

to improve the production capability of the reservoir or to substantially increase the recoverable reserves through additional<br /><br />
investments. Any extension of the production period of the Coalbed Methane Field due to such additional development<br /><br />
projects shall be subject to the related provision of Article 4.5 hereof.<br /><br />
11.7 Notwithstanding the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production or anything else to the contrary herein, the<br /><br />

with the objective of the Parties being to obtain the best price possible.<br /><br />
The transportation costs to be used to determine the FOB price at the Delivery Point shall be agreed to during the<br /><br />
negotiation of the long-term sales and purchase agreements and prior to the preparation and approval by the Parties of an<br /><br />
Overall Development Program. Such transportation costs shall be determined in accordance with international petroleum and<br /><br />
