The proposed contract area covers approximately four hundred thirty three and        <br /><br /><br />
9798/10,000 hectares.                                                                <br /><br /><br />
4.0    Project Area Description                                                      <br /><br /><br />
4.1    Terrain/Physiography                                                          <br /><br /><br />
Straddling the eastern foothills of the Diwata Range and hugging the coast, the      <br /><br /><br />
area is characterized by a generally moderate to rough topography with               <br /><br /><br />
prominent ridges and numerous intervening narrow valleys. The highest                <br /><br /><br />
elevation is almost 300 meters, with most part of the area not lower than 30         <br /><br /><br />
meters above sea level. The rather rugged terrain in the southern part of the        <br /><br /><br />
area passes on to a gentler and more subdued landscape to the north and              <br /><br /><br />
northeast. The ridges tend to follow a more or less north-south trend possibly       <br /><br /><br />
reflecting the general structural grain of the region.                               <br /><br /><br />
4.2    Accessibility                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
It takes anywhere from two to three hours by car to cover the Claver-Surigao         <br /><br /><br />
city route. Regular passenger jeepneys and buses ply this route. From Manila         <br /><br /><br />
and Cebu, Surigao City is serviced daily by Philippine Airlines. Interisland         <br /><br /><br />
vessels connect this city with other areas in Mindanao and the Visayas.              <br /><br /><br />
4.3    Drainage System/s                                                             <br /><br /><br />
The Hinadladan River and Tandawa Creek make up the most important water              <br /><br /><br />
systems within the immediate area, these empty into Dahican Bay which                <br /><br /><br />
straddles the northern and eastern portion of the area. Minor streams and            <br /><br /><br />
tributaries are mostly intermittent and tend to be dry for most part of the year.    <br /><br /><br />
4.4    Vegetation                                                                    <br /><br /><br />
Vegetation cover in the area may be classified under two main types: natural         <br /><br /><br />
vegetation consisting of forest and grass/shrub formations; and cultivated           <br /><br /><br />
vegetation. Plant species belonging to the natural vegetation category are           <br /><br /><br />
mostly found in the forest and uplands and consist principally of dipterocaps,       <br /><br /><br />
bamboo, molave, and various wild shrubs and lesser plants. Trees like acacia,        <br /><br /><br />
apitong, balete, banana (butuan), lauan, ipil-ipil, and many other commercial        <br /><br /><br />
tree species typifies this formation. Various species of orchids are also            <br /><br /><br />
common in the forest land, although these had also been decimated with the           <br /><br /><br />
loss of the primary forest cover. In the open grasslands on the                      <br /><br /><br />
other hand, mainly cogon and    other grass species and shrubs                       <br /><br /><br />
like amorseco, aamo, cadena de amor, etc. Predominate. Portions                      <br /><br /><br />
subjected to reforestation commonly support species like mangium,                    <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                     <br /><br /><br />

 agoho, gmelina and large-leafed mahogany. Bamboo (buho) are mainly found              <br /><br /><br />
 along drainage channels where they commonly form impenetrable clumps.                 <br /><br /><br />
 Cultivated vegetation includes the plant species that are utilized for food or        <br /><br /><br />
 ornamental purposes. This includes coconut, banana, mango, guava, camotent-           <br /><br /><br />
 cahoy, caballero, bignay, and other fruit and ornamental trees and plants. These      <br /><br /><br />
 species are commonly found in clear-cut and cultivated areas.                         <br /><br /><br />
 4.5 Land Use                                                                          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
 The major portion of the proposed contract area is bare of forest cover and           <br /><br /><br />
 supports only minor trees, shrubs and cogon grasss. Thick clumps of vegetation        <br /><br /><br />
 are encountered only along the major waterways where plant growth is more             <br /><br /><br />
 conducive. The whole area is practically bare during the summer months and is         <br /><br /><br />
 visibly brown and earthy in color.                                                    <br /><br /><br />
 Only a very minor part of the area is utilized for residential purpose. Most of       <br /><br /><br />
 the houses and dwellings are found along the highway or major access routes,          <br /><br /><br />
 the coast, main water channels and in areas where the slopes are more favorable.      <br /><br /><br />
 Agriculture in the area is dominated by coconut and other cash crops. This is         <br /><br /><br />
 particularly true along the coastal part of the area. Less accessible sections        <br /><br /><br />
 especially in the hinterlands are mainly barren or grasslands. The area appears       <br /><br /><br />
 to have a rather limited prospect for long term agricultural use due to the rather    <br /><br /><br />
 low productivity of the soil and the lack of adequate infrastructure support.         <br /><br /><br />

 5.1.1    Survey of previous work/s on the area                               <br /><br /><br />
 A number of geological studies had been carried in and around the area       <br /><br /><br />
 during the past thirty years or so. A lot of these centered on the           <br /><br /><br />
 characterization of the geology and mineral resources found therein.         <br /><br /><br />
 The most notable studies include those carried out by Rigor (1960) on        <br /><br /><br />
 the Ni-Fe resources of the Surigao Iron Reservation; Manlansing              <br /><br /><br />
 (1968) on a study of the laterite deposit in Dahican, Carrascal, Surigao     <br /><br /><br />
 del Sur; and Andrada & Sosa (1980) on mineral occurrences in certain         <br /><br /><br />
 areas in Carrascal, Cantilan, and Madrid, Surigao del Sur and Claver,        <br /><br /><br />
 Surigao del Norte. These studies indicated the occurrence of nickel-         <br /><br /><br />
 laterite and iron deposits in the area. Other works carried out by           <br /><br /><br />
 private exploration companies gave similar indications although access       <br /><br /><br />
 to these data may be less easy than those mentioned earlier.                 <br /><br /><br />
 5.1.2    Data compilation/collation                                          <br /><br /><br />
 The proponent shall strive to obtain all pertinent geological,               <br /><br /><br />
                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 geochemical, and related data on the area during the course of data          <br /><br /><br />
 collation and compilation. From the data generated preliminary               <br /><br /><br />
 geological and mineral occurrence maps will be prepared and utilized as      <br /><br /><br />
 basis for the initial field survey of the target area.                       <br /><br /><br />
 The research and data compilation phase will entail a total cost of          <br /><br /><br />
                                                                              <br /><br /><br />

 Prior to the conduct of the actual field survey, a remote sensing study      <br /><br /><br />
 will be undertaken to arrive at an intial analysis of the geology and        <br /><br /><br />
 structural character of the area. The remote sensing study will include      <br /><br /><br />
 airphoto, radar and/or satellite images analysis and interpretations. The    <br /><br /><br />
 study will be carried out mainly in Manila by a reputable group that will    <br /><br /><br />
 be contracted upon the approval of the MPSA application. The remote          <br /><br /><br />
 sensing study will last for about two (2) months and will make use of        <br /><br /><br />
 three to four personnel. The main output from the study will be              <br /><br /><br />
 geological and lineament maps of a scale of 1:25,000 to 1:10,000.            <br /><br /><br />
 The remote sensing study will entail an estimated cost of about one          <br /><br /><br />

 Except for a limited period (1 month) for conducting groundtruthing of         <br /><br /><br />
 the outputs of the remote sensing study, regional scale geological             <br /><br /><br />
 mapping or survey will not be undertaken. The preliminary geological           <br /><br /><br />
 and lineament maps generated during the previous phase is deemed               <br /><br /><br />
 sufficient for planning the semi-detailed phase of the exploration             <br /><br /><br />
 program.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />

 Regional scale geochemical soil sampling will also not be undertaken in        <br /><br /><br />
 the area. There is sufficient initial data and information on the nickel-      <br /><br /><br />
 laterite deposit to proceed with the semi-detailed phase. The proponent        <br /><br /><br />
 is hopeful of retrieving geochemical and related data from previous            <br /><br /><br />
 studies and exploration works undertaken in and around the area.               <br /><br /><br />
 Preliminary geochemical anomaly map/s will be prepared from the data           <br /><br /><br />
 generated.                                                                     <br /><br /><br />

 Geophysical exploration techniques are not considered during this phase        <br /><br /><br />
 of the program.                                                                <br /><br /><br />

 5.3.1 Geological mapping/alteration studies                                    <br /><br /><br />
 Utilizing the output of the initial phase, a semi-detailed geological          <br /><br /><br />
 survey will be implemented to further delimit the lateral extent of the        <br /><br /><br />
 prospective nickel-laterite deposit/s. The actual field survey will            <br /><br /><br />
 include geological traverses along drainage channels, road cuts, and           <br /><br /><br />
 other surface exposures. Compass and tape mapping might be resorted            <br /><br /><br />
 to along sections with prominent exposures or mineralization. The              <br /><br /><br />
 survey will focus on the distribution and thickness of the nickel-laterite     <br /><br /><br />
 deposit and will also highlight its physical characteristics.                  <br /><br /><br />
 A total of five hundred hectares (500 has.) is expected to be covered by       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                <br /><br /><br />
 this program within a period of two to three months. A total of fifteen        <br /><br /><br />
 (15) personnel, three (3) geologists/field mappers and twelve (12)             <br /><br /><br />
 support staff (field aides and laborers) will be utilized to undertake this    <br /><br /><br />
 and the geochemical sampling program. The semi-detailed geologic               <br /><br /><br />
 mapping program is estimated to cost around eighty thousand pesos              <br /><br /><br />
 (P80,000).                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
 The main output from this program are geological maps and sections of          <br /><br /><br />
 1:10,000 and 1:5,000 scale and the corresponding geological/technical          <br /><br /><br />
 reports.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />

                                                                             <br /><br /><br />
A geochemical soil sampling program will be carried out concurrently         <br /><br /><br />
with the semi-detailed geological survey. This will also cover 500           <br /><br /><br />
hectares with soil samples being taken at a density of 2 samples per         <br /><br /><br />
hectare. Base of slopes and ridge and spur sampling procedure will be        <br /><br /><br />
followed in this program. A total of around 250 to 300 soil samples          <br /><br /><br />
is projected to be taken. Whenever good or promising exposures are           <br /><br /><br />
encountered rock and saprolite samples will likewise be taken. It is         <br /><br /><br />
projected that around 20 to 30 rock and saprolite samples will be            <br /><br /><br />
obtained during this phase.                                                  <br /><br /><br />
Soil samples will be analyzed mainly for Ni and Co by AAS following          <br /><br /><br />
a hot acid digestion. Rock samples will be similarly analysed for Ni         <br /><br /><br />
and Co with choice samples also subjected to XRD and petrographic            <br /><br /><br />
studies.                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
The geochemical sampling program will be implemented by the same             <br /><br /><br />
field team/s carrying out geological mapping. The cost estimate              <br /><br /><br />
presented earlier covers both the geological mapping and the                 <br /><br /><br />
geochemical sampling programs.                                               <br /><br /><br />
The main output from this program are geochemical anomaly maps of            <br /><br /><br />
a scale of 1:10,000 and 1:5,000; geochemical data for soil and rock          <br /><br /><br />
samples; and corresponding technical reports.                                <br /><br /><br />
The total cost for this program is estimated at seventy thousand pesos       <br /><br /><br />
(P70,000).                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

The proponent might consider this exploration option depending on the        <br /><br /><br />
results obtained from the previous programs implemented.                     <br /><br /><br />
5.3.4    Subsurface investigation                                            <br /><br /><br />
An initial test pitting program will be implemented during this stage and    <br /><br /><br />
will be undertaken in the most promising or favorable sites. Around ten      <br /><br /><br />
(10) to twenty (20) test pits will be excavated per site depending on the    <br /><br /><br />
size and extent of the laterite deposit/s encountered or delineated. A       <br /><br /><br />
total of fifty (50) test pits is targetted during this stage of the          <br /><br /><br />
exploration program. About 70 to 100 geochemical soil samples are            <br /><br /><br />
expected to be generated.                                                    <br /><br /><br />
Test pitting will be undertaken in two (2) months and will require a total   <br /><br /><br />
of twelve (12) technical and support personnel to implement. The             <br /><br /><br />
estimated cost for this undertaking is around fifty thousand pesos           <br /><br /><br />
(P50,000).                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

 The topographic/cadastral survey will be undertaken to the establish the        <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                 <br /><br /><br />
 topographic configuration of the area and to provide accurate ground            <br /><br /><br />
 control points for the field survey, particularly during the detailed phase.    <br /><br /><br />
 Around two hundred fifty hectares (250 has.) will be covered in this            <br /><br /><br />
 survey. This will be very useful in locating future developmental works         <br /><br /><br />
 and will also be critical in defining accurately the boundaries of the          <br /><br /><br />
 contract area. The topographic maps to be produced will be on a scale           <br /><br /><br />
 of 1:200 with contour intervals of 2 to 5 meters. An amount of one              <br /><br /><br />
 hundred fifty thousand pesos (P 125,000) is programmed for the                  <br /><br /><br />
 undertaking with the bulk of the work to be contracted out to reputable         <br /><br /><br />
 firms. The entire survey activity is projected to last two (2) months.          <br /><br /><br />

 The detailed geological mapping program will be carried out using the           <br /><br /><br />
 compass and tape method with traverses being limited over relatively            <br /><br /><br />
 small area/s where the best and most prominent exposures or nickel-             <br /><br /><br />
 laterite occurrences are found. About 100 to 200 hectares will be               <br /><br /><br />
 covered under this program over a six-month period starting on the last         <br /><br /><br />
 quarter of the fisrt year. This will be implemented by a group                  <br /><br /><br />
 comprising three (3) technical men (geologist/field mappers), three (3)         <br /><br /><br />
 geologic or field aides, and fifteen (15) pick-up laborers. The main            <br /><br /><br />
 equipment and tools to be utilized are brunton compasses, clinometers,          <br /><br /><br />
 sample pick, hand lens, meter tape, and other basis field supplies and          <br /><br /><br />
 materials.                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
 Estimated cost for the detailed geological mapping program is placed at         <br /><br /><br />
 eighty thousand pesos (P80,000) covering expenses for field supplies            <br /><br /><br />
 and materials, contractual services, and wages for pick-up labor.               <br /><br /><br />
 Output of this activity will include detailed geological maps and sections      <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                 <br /><br /><br />

 The detailed geochemical survey will be carried out using a grid system         <br /><br /><br />
 for sampling point location and control. Although the disposition and           <br /><br /><br />
 geometry of the grid system to be adopted has yet to be finalized, the          <br /><br /><br />
 initial plan is to have 20 to 30 picket lines of 400 to 500 meter lenght        <br /><br /><br />
 and 50 meter interval and with soil samples being taken at every 25-            <br /><br /><br />
 meter distance. In highly prospective sites, auger drilling will be carried     <br /><br /><br />
 out to provide a vertical dimension to the geochemical profile and to           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                 <br /><br /><br />

                  pattern may also be opted for under this case. It is projected that about      <br /><br /><br />
                  600 to 700 soil samples will be generated during this stage of the             <br /><br /><br />

                  geological mapping program. The same field group undertaking the               <br /><br /><br />
                  latter will do the sampling with additional 6 to 8 laborers to be utilized     <br /><br /><br />
                  should the need arise.                                                         <br /><br /><br />

                  As in the previous geochemical program, the output will be mainly              <br /><br /><br />
                  geochemical anomaly maps and profiles on a scale of 1: 500 to 1: 100,          <br /><br /><br />
                  soil geochemical data, and corresponding technical reports.                    <br /><br /><br />

                  Auger drilling will be undertaken in selected sites to obtain subsurface       <br /><br /><br />
                  samples down to a depth of about 3 to 5 meters. In the initial semi-           <br /><br /><br />
                  detailed phase, a regular hand auger will be utilized. This is capable of      <br /><br /><br />
                  penetrating down to about a meter or more, with samples to be taken at         <br /><br /><br />
                  about half a meter interval. During the detailed or follow-up stage, a         <br /><br /><br />
                  mechanized auger drill will be utilized for better penetration. This will      <br /><br /><br />
                  be instigated in the more promising area/s to allow testing of the deeper      <br /><br /><br />
                  sections of the laterite profile. A more closely spaced sampling interval      <br /><br /><br />
                  can be adopted during this phase to better define the variation in nickel-     <br /><br /><br />
                  cobalt values and the physical characteristics of the laterite deposit.        <br /><br /><br />
                  The auger drilling program can be undertaken by 4 to 5 support                 <br /><br /><br />

                  mapping and sampling activities. The initial drilling program is               <br /><br /><br />
                  scheduled for 2 months with about 40 to 50 holes targetted for                 <br /><br /><br />
                  completion. The detailed phase on the other hand is programmed for 3           <br /><br /><br />

 laterite deposit, the depth of the test pit will be anywhere from 3 to 6    <br /><br /><br />
 meters. Actual excavation will be undertaken using implements like          <br /><br /><br />
 picks, shovels, crow bars, buckets and pulleys. No mechanized               <br /><br /><br />
 equipment will be utilized during this program.                             <br /><br /><br />
 Around 150 to 200 test pits are programmed to be excavated during the       <br /><br /><br />
 two-year exploration program with about 50 scheduled during the semi-       <br /><br /><br />
 detailed phase and 100 to 150 during the detailed phase. The test           <br /><br /><br />
 pitting program will cover roughly eight months with most of the work       <br /><br /><br />
 to be carried out concurrently with the other programs like geological      <br /><br /><br />
 mapping and geochemical sampling. Around 400 samples are expected           <br /><br /><br />
 to be generated by this activity.                                           <br /><br /><br />

 This covers activities geared towards defining the impact/s of the          <br /><br /><br />
 exploration program on the local environment. This will involve the         <br /><br /><br />
 establishment of base line data for identified critical environmental       <br /><br /><br />
 parameters and the setting up of an appropriate monitoring scheme to        <br /><br /><br />
 detect the changes these undergo during the course of the program.          <br /><br /><br />
 This will also include the conduct of an information and education          <br /><br /><br />
 campaign (IEC) among the local residents and affected people to make        <br /><br /><br />
 them aware of the activities being carried out by the proponent and how     <br /><br /><br />
 these might affect them in the long run.                                    <br /><br /><br />
 The environmental studies will be undertaken in consonance with the         <br /><br /><br />
 other exploration activities to allow cost efficiency of operations. A      <br /><br /><br />
 budget of one hundred fifty thousand pesos (PI50,000) is programmed         <br /><br /><br />
 for these undertakings.                                                     <br /><br /><br />

 Agriculture in the area is dominated by coconut and other cash crops.            <br /><br /><br />
 This is particularly true along the coastal part of the area. Less accessible    <br /><br /><br />
 sections especially in the hinterlands are mainly barren or grasslands. The      <br /><br /><br />
 area appears to have a rather limited prospect for long term agricultural use    <br /><br /><br />
 due to the rather low productivity of the soil and the lack of adequate          <br /><br /><br />
 infrastructure support.                                                          <br /><br /><br />

 Soil within the immediate proposed contract area falls under the sub-order       <br /><br /><br />
 Tropept, Order Inceptizol based on the Bureau of Soils & Water                   <br /><br /><br />
 Management (BSWM) classification scheme. Soils falling under the sub¬            <br /><br /><br />
 order Tropept are generally characterized as having been formed in an            <br /><br /><br />
 isomesic or warm temperature regime on a moderate to steep slopes in the         <br /><br /><br />
 humid tropics. Most tropepts have either an ochric or umbric epipedon            <br /><br /><br />
 and a cambric horizon. Inceptizols on the other hand is characterized by         <br /><br /><br />
 having one or more horizons in which mineral materials other than                <br /><br /><br />
 carbonates or amorphous silica have been altered or removed but not              <br /><br /><br />
 accumulated to a significant degree. These soils contain a preponderance         <br /><br /><br />
 of weatherable minerals and have an ochric or umbric epipedon over a             <br /><br /><br />
 cambric horizon and sometimes a fragipan.                                        <br /><br /><br />
 As mentioned earlier on, the soil in the area has a generally low productive     <br /><br /><br />

 capacity due toits relative immaturity and low organic content. It is            <br /><br /><br />
 therefore incapable of supporting long term agricultural production.             <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

 streams and tributaries are mostly intermittent and tend to be dry for most      <br /><br /><br />
 part of the year.                                                                <br /><br /><br />

 Climate in the area falls under Type II of the Modified Coronas                  <br /><br /><br />
 Classification of PAG AS A. This climate type is characterized by a very         <br /><br /><br />
 pronounced maximum rain period in winter. Maximum rainfall generally             <br /><br /><br />
 occur in December and January, although there is not a single dry month.         <br /><br /><br />
 Areas characterized by this climate type are generally found along or very       <br /><br /><br />

 air quality will be set concurrently with the conduct of environmental           <br /><br /><br />
 studies in the area.                                                             <br /><br /><br />

                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 The area and its immediate vicinities are principally underlain by volcanic      <br /><br /><br />
 rocks, limestone, clastic rocks, ultramafic complex, and alluvium.               <br /><br /><br />
 Portions underlain by the ultramafic rocks are found to be mineralized and       <br /><br /><br />
 it is made up chiefly of dunite, pyroxene-peridotite and serpentinites. The      <br /><br /><br />
 principal mineral deposits are the nickel-iron bearing lateritic soil and the    <br /><br /><br />
 nickel-enriched decomposed serpentinite resting over ultramafic rocks.           <br /><br /><br />
 Nickeliferous laterite and nickel-bearing decomposed serpentinite occur as       <br /><br /><br />
 thick mantle blanketing the ultramafic exposures along favorable slopes          <br /><br /><br />
 and flat terrains of high relief.                                                <br /><br /><br />
 Despite the wide area underlain by serpentinized ultramafic rocks, the           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 important nickeliferous deposits are found only along the northeastern           <br /><br /><br />
 coastal area of the Mineral Reservation extending from the southern              <br /><br /><br />
 portion of Adlay, Carrascal, Surigao del Sur westward to Urbiztondo,             <br /><br /><br />
 Claver, Surigao del Norte. Small and scattered lateritic tracts are also         <br /><br /><br />
 found capping the more gentle ridges on the southwestward portion of the         <br /><br /><br />
 Reservation particularly in Baoy and Mt. Legazpi Ranges.                         <br /><br /><br />
 The reddish-brown lateritic soil capping the gentle ridges consists mainly       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 of limonite and hematite with subordinate amount of magnetite. Near the          <br /><br /><br />
 surface and a few meters downward, hematite and limonite pellets                 <br /><br /><br />
 predominate. These pellets increase in quantity and size towards the             <br /><br /><br />
 surface and sometimes are found cemented together into a limonitic crust.        <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

 Large fragments of chromite-magnetite cobbles are also occasionally               <br /><br /><br />
 observed. Undelying the lateritic mantle is the yellowish-green to                <br /><br /><br />
 greenish, soft decomposed serpentinite and serpentinized pyroxene-                <br /><br /><br />
 peridotite. Being the basal portion of the deposits, this section commonly        <br /><br /><br />
 contains a higher grade of nickel than the overlying lateritic soil.              <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />
 Mountain peaks within the area seldom reach 400 meters above sea-level.           <br /><br /><br />
 The lateritic areas are characterized by gentle slopes to moderate relief         <br /><br /><br />
 with elevations ranging from 50 to around 200 mask The non-lateritic              <br /><br /><br />
 areas to the east and south exhibit moderate o steep ridges, gentle rolling       <br /><br /><br />
 terrain and nearly flat surfaces, being underlain mainly by limestone,            <br /><br /><br />
 clastic rocks, and alluvial deposits. Occasional patches of swampy areas          <br /><br /><br />
 are localized within the floodplain and coastal areas. Over-all, the area         <br /><br /><br />
 can be desribed as being on the late stage of geomorphic development.             <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

 Vegetation cover in the area may be classified under two main types:              <br /><br /><br />
 natural vegetation consisting of forest and grass/shrub formations; and           <br /><br /><br />
 cultivated vegetation. Plant species belonging to the natural vegetation          <br /><br /><br />
 category are mostly found in the forest and uplands and consist principally       <br /><br /><br />
 of dipterocaps, bamboo, molave, and various wild shrubs and lesser plants.        <br /><br /><br />
 Trees like acacia, apitong, balete, banana (butuan), lauan, ipil-ipil, and        <br /><br /><br />
 many other commercial tree species typifies this formation. Various               <br /><br /><br />
 species of orchids are also common in the forest land, although these had         <br /><br /><br />
 also been decimated with the loss of the primary forest cover. In the open        <br /><br /><br />
 grasslands on the other hand, mainly cogon and other grass species and            <br /><br /><br />
 shrubs like amorseco, aamo, cadena de amor, etc. Predominate. Portions            <br /><br /><br />
 subjected to reforestation commonly support species like mangium, agoho,          <br /><br /><br />
 gmelina and large-leafed mahogany. Bamboo (buho) are mainly found                 <br /><br /><br />
 along drainage channels where they commonly form impenetrable clumps.             <br /><br /><br />
 Cultivated vegetation includes the plant species that are utilized for food or    <br /><br /><br />
 ornamental purposes. This includes coconut, banana, mango, guava,                 <br /><br /><br />
 camotent-cahoy, Caballero, bignay, and other fruit and ornamental trees           <br /><br /><br />
 and plants. These species are commonly found in clear-cut and cultivated          <br /><br /><br />
 areas.                                                                            <br /><br /><br />
 Clear-cutting of the forest for commercial utilization of lumber and              <br /><br /><br />

                   many rare plant species may have been lost during the past few decades or                  <br /><br /><br />

 species that requires protection. Its proximity to already habitated or                                      <br /><br /><br />
 developed areas have rendered it susceptible to human incursions and                                         <br /><br /><br />
 consequently much of its former wildlife had either moved to more remote                                     <br /><br /><br />
 regions or had been decimated by human activities like hunting, trapping,                                    <br /><br /><br />
 and forest products gathering. The introduction of domesticated animals                                      <br /><br /><br />
 like dogs, cats, pigs, etc. Has placed undue pressure on the local fauna.                                    <br /><br /><br />
 The ecological niche occupied by the native fauna is now almost totally                                      <br /><br /><br />
 taken over by the introduced animal species especially along the fringes of                                  <br /><br /><br />
 the forest lands and logged-over areas. Animals like wild boar, monkeys,                                     <br /><br /><br />
 deer, monitor lizard (bayawak) and bayakan (wild bat) are now rarely                                         <br /><br /><br />
 encountered particularly in the more accessible and habitated sites.                                         <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                              <br /><br /><br />
 Invertebrates, such as several species of insects, arachnids, mollusks,                                      <br /><br /><br />
 crustaceans, and chilopods have suffered a similar fate. Human incursions                                    <br /><br /><br />
 and clear-cutting of the forest have seriously damaged or destroyed their                                    <br /><br /><br />
 habitats leading to their migration or retreat to less affected portions of the                              <br /><br /><br />
 hinterlands.                                                                                                 <br /><br /><br />

 In the rivers and swamps, the main fish species are mosquito fish, guramy,                                   <br /><br /><br />
 tilapia, catfish and mudfish. Mollusks like telescope shell, planorbids and                                  <br /><br /><br />
 moon shells are common. Freshwater crabs, shrimps and crayfish are also                                      <br /><br /><br />
 fairly well represented. Natural plant species found in the wetlands include                                 <br /><br /><br />
 talahib, byuro, kangkong, cattails and other water plants. Little is known                                   <br /><br /><br />

 are found in Claver town proper although smaller ones are also found in           <br /><br /><br />
 Cagdianao and nearby barangays.                                                   <br /><br /><br />
 Lifestyle is simple and typical of rural areas. Traditional social gatherings     <br /><br /><br />
 or events such as fiestas, birthdays or marriages are unfailingly observed.       <br /><br /><br />
 Being mostly Christians, church celebrations are faithfully observed with         <br /><br /><br />
 the usual trimmings and candor.                                                   <br /><br /><br />
 Health and safety conditions may be described as tolerable although there         <br /><br /><br />
 is a general lack of facilities for health and medical care. One has to travel    <br /><br /><br />
 to the town proper or Surigao City to avail of medical treatment or               <br /><br /><br />
 hospitalization. Most of the local people rely on folk or herbal medicine to      <br /><br /><br />
 get by.                                                                           <br /><br /><br />
 Tap water, electricity and telephone service are not available in the area. It    <br /><br /><br />
 is only in Claver and other big towns that these services or amenities can        <br /><br /><br />
 be availed of. There are no major recreational facility in the area, although     <br /><br /><br />
 this does not deter the local populace especially the youth from utilizing        <br /><br /><br />
 whatever space available for games like basketball or volleyball.                 <br /><br /><br />
 Gambling and drinking of native wines or liquor are common pastimes               <br /><br /><br />
 among the populace.                                                               <br /><br /><br />

 area. The road is for the most part serviceable but poorly maintained and         <br /><br /><br />
 difficult to traverse during the rainy season. Bridges are built across the       <br /><br /><br />
 major rivers and streams but these are generally of limited gauge and             <br /><br /><br />
 capacity. From the main highway minor roads that are commonly                     <br /><br /><br />
 impassable during the rainy season connect the different barangays to the         <br /><br /><br />

                   deterioration in water quality is expected over sections of the streams        <br /><br /><br />
                   affected by siltation. The main effect will be an increase in turbidity and    <br /><br /><br />
                   possible reduction of oxygen content. This in turn can cause the loss of       <br /><br /><br />

                   nature as recovery is expected once restoration work on the excavations are    <br /><br /><br />
                   carried out.                                                                   <br /><br /><br />

 6.3    On the ecology (effects on ecosystem of site preparation, alteration of land              <br /><br /><br />
 form and natural drainage, and noise, etc.)                                                      <br /><br /><br />
 By and large the effect on the ecology of the area is not expected to be                         <br /><br /><br />
 very serious since most of the impacts of the activities to be carried out                       <br /><br /><br />
 will be temporary. Restoration works, like the replacement of the                                <br /><br /><br />
 excavated materials on the test pits and putting up of siltation ponds or                        <br /><br /><br />
 dams are expected to promote the recovery of the area in the earliest                            <br /><br /><br />
 possible time. Long term or serious lasting effects are not expected to                          <br /><br /><br />
 occur due to the implementation of the exploration program.                                      <br /><br /><br />
 6.4    On socioeconomic effects (to include among others impact on                               <br /><br /><br />
 indigenous/ethnic communities, where applicable - culture, tradition and                         <br /><br /><br />
 lifestyle)                                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
 The conduct of the exploration program within the area is also not                               <br /><br /><br />
 expected to have any major socioeconomic consequences. Employment                                <br /><br /><br />
 opportunities for the local inhabitants will be created during the conduct of                    <br /><br /><br />
 the activities and this in turn will mean an inflow of income into the                           <br /><br /><br />
 system. Considering that most of the activities to be carried out are of                         <br /><br /><br />
 short duration, the general impact on the peoples’ income will not be that                       <br /><br /><br />
 impressive. It will however still be considered sizable considering the                          <br /><br /><br />
 general lack of employment opportunities in the area. People residing in                         <br /><br /><br />
 the forest and those dependent upon the forest for their livelihood will not                     <br /><br /><br />
 be severely affected by the exploration activities. The excavation of test                       <br /><br /><br />
 pits in some portions of the area may render some inconvenience to the                           <br /><br /><br />
 forest dwellers but again this will be temporary and will be remedied as                         <br /><br /><br />
 soon as the test pits are covered up.                                                            <br /><br /><br />
 The exploration project is not anticipated to result in any changes in the                       <br /><br /><br />
 tradition, culture and lifestyle of th elocal people.                                            <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

                  During the implementation of the exploration program, a number of               <br /><br /><br />
                  measures will be adopted to minimze if not mitigate the adverse effects the     <br /><br /><br />
                  program might have on the environment. It should be noted however that          <br /><br /><br />
                  exploration programs are by and large environmentally benign operations         <br /><br /><br />
                  that give rise to generally minimal impact on the environment and the           <br /><br /><br />
                  people living within the area subject to exploration.                           <br /><br /><br />
                  The measures to be instigated will iclude the following:                        <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                  a)    Putting up of settling ponds, sediment traps or impoundments along        <br /><br /><br />
                  some of the drainage channelways to minimize siltation. This will be            <br /><br /><br />
                  particularly useful in reducing the sediment load of streams draining areas     <br /><br /><br />
                  of excavation, road rehabilitation or construction. The stockpile of loose      <br /><br /><br />
                  soil and rock materials from excavations will be provided with the most         <br /><br /><br />
                  efficient drainage ways posiible to retard if not totally eliminate the         <br /><br /><br />
                  introduction of massive amounts of sediments into the water systems. This       <br /><br /><br />
                  can be done by digging small diversionary canals around the stockpiles that     <br /><br /><br />
                  will channel surface run-off away from these or by setting up barriers like     <br /><br /><br />
                  wooden planks or plastic sheets around the stockpiles to keep the material      <br /><br /><br />
                  in place.                                                                       <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                  b)    Stabilization of slopes to reduce erosion. This will be carried out in    <br /><br /><br />
                  areas of unstable slopes to prevent landslides that might cut-off the access    <br /><br /><br />
                  routes or otherwise jeopardize the work areas. This could be done by rip¬       <br /><br /><br />
                  rapping or terracing the the exposed and unstable portions of the slope.        <br /><br /><br />
                  Reduction of steep slopes could also be resorted to especially along critical   <br /><br /><br />
                  roadcuts or in areas immediately upslope of the excavation. Planting of         <br /><br /><br />
                  cover folliage along slopes with barren vegetative cover will also be done      <br /><br /><br />
                  to stabilize the surface. This can easily be done by using fast-growing         <br /><br /><br />
                  shrubs and other plants as cover.                                               <br /><br /><br />
                  c)    Minimize the cutting of trees and removal of vegetative cover. The        <br /><br /><br />
                  cutting of trees and removal of cover folliage will be reduced to the barest    <br /><br /><br />
                  minimum possible under the program. Whenever a need arises to cut trees         <br /><br /><br />
                  for local use or to remove obstructions, only the less exotic or inferior       <br /><br /><br />
                  species will be utilized or removed. Survey and gridlines shall be set up in    <br /><br /><br />
                  such a way as to go around or skip areas of thick vegetative cover or large     <br /><br /><br />
                  trees. Reforestation activities presently being undertaken within the area      <br /><br /><br />
                  will be supported and as much as possible will be spared from any major         <br /><br /><br />
                  activity. Planting of cover foliage will be routinely undertaken especially     <br /><br /><br />
                  in critical areas. Every effort wil be exerted to prevent bushfires and         <br /><br /><br />
                  discourage slahs-and-bum practices that might render some areas totally         <br /><br /><br />
                  bare.                                                                           <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />

                  d)    Restoration of excavated areas. The test pits excavated for subsurface    <br /><br /><br />
                  sampling and studies will be covered-up or back-filled once these had           <br /><br /><br />
                  served their purpose. Efforts will be exerted to ensure that these will not     <br /><br /><br />
                  pose any danger to animals or people straying into the area. The diggings       <br /><br /><br />
                  will be fenced-off temporarily if these will retained for future follow-up      <br /><br /><br />
                  studies or resampling. Once back-filled, replanting of cover folliage will      <br /><br /><br />
                  be undertaken to stabilize the surface. Maximum care will be exercised to       <br /><br /><br />
                  ensure that the original soil stratification will be restored during back¬      <br /><br /><br />
                  filling. This can be done by segregating the top soil from the underlying       <br /><br /><br />
                  material and then returning this portion to its original position during the    <br /><br /><br />
                  restoration work.                                                               <br /><br /><br />
                                                                                                  <br /><br /><br />
                  e)    Solid and liquid wastes generated during the conduct of the exploration   <br /><br /><br />
                  program shall be disposed of properly to prevent posible contamination of       <br /><br /><br />
                  the environment. Organic solid wastes like paper products, wood chips,          <br /><br /><br />
                  food residues, etc. will be buried in appropriate sites. Other solid waste      <br /><br /><br />
                  like plastic products, glasswares and metallic material will either be burned   <br /><br /><br />
                  or taken out of the area for final disposal. Liquid wastes like used oils,      <br /><br /><br />
                  excess fuel, kerosene and similar products will also be burned to reduce        <br /><br /><br />
                  contamination of surface and groundwaters. As only minimal amounts of           <br /><br /><br />
                  these are expected to be generated during the course of the exploration         <br /><br /><br />
                  program, major contamination arising from sepages or leaks of these             <br /><br /><br />
                  sources is not foreseen. The proponent shall see to it that proper storage of   <br /><br /><br />
                  these materials is practiced to reduce chances of accidental spills or          <br /><br /><br />
                  leakages. It shall also see to it that only minimal amount of these materials   <br /><br /><br />
                  are stored in any one place at any one time for easier handling and control.    <br /><br /><br />
                  Aside from the small amount of nitric acid and potassium chromate that          <br /><br /><br />
                  will be utilized during water sampling for environmental study, no toxic        <br /><br /><br />
                  chemicals or reagents will be brought into the area during the field survey.    <br /><br /><br />

                  be undertaken to stabilize the surface. Maximum care will be exercised to       <br /><br /><br />
                  ensure that the original soil stratification will be restored during back¬      <br /><br /><br />
                  filling. This can be done by segregating the top soil from the underlying       <br /><br /><br />
                  material and then returning this portion to its original position during the    <br /><br /><br />

                  program shall be disposed of properly to prevent posible contamination of       <br /><br /><br />
                  the environment. Organic solid wastes like paper products, wood chips,          <br /><br /><br />
                  food residues, etc. will be buried in appropriate sites. Other solid waste      <br /><br /><br />
                  like plastic products, glasswares and metallic material will either be burned   <br /><br /><br />
                  or taken out of the area for final disposal. Liquid wastes like used oils,      <br /><br /><br />
                  excess fuel, kerosene and similar products will also be burned to reduce        <br /><br /><br />
                  contamination of surface and groundwaters. As only minimal amounts of           <br /><br /><br />
