RECOVERY OF OPERATING COSTS AND SHARING OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
PRODUCTION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be calculated on a Contract Area basis for<br /><br />
Royalty Oil, Cost Oil and Profit Oil. This allocation of Available Crude Oil shall be in<br /><br />
accordance with the Accounting Procedure, the Allocation and Lifting Procedure and<br /><br />
this Clause 10 as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Royalty Oil shall be allocated to the State from the first day of Production,<br /><br />
based on the daily total of Available Crude Oil from a Contract Area, set at a<br /><br />
rate of two percent (2%);<br /><br />
   <br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be allocated to the Contractor in such quantum as will generate<br /><br />
an amount of Proceeds sufficient for recovery of Operating Costs in each<br /><br />
Contract Area. All costs will be recovered in United States dollars through<br /><br />
Cost Oil allocation;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Cost Oil shall be not more than eighty percent (80%) of Available Crude Oil in<br /><br />
each Contract Area less deduction of Royalty Oil in any accounting period;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Profit Oil, being the balance of Available Crude Oil after deducting Royalty<br /><br />
Oil and Cost Oil shall be allocated to each Party based on the pre-tax, nominal<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
<br /><br />
rate of return calculated on a quarterly basis for the Contract Area in<br /><br />
accordance with the following sliding scale:<br /><br />
Contractor’s Rate of Return for<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Beginning at the date of Commercial Discovery, Contractor’s rate of return shall be<br /><br />
determined at the end of each Quarter on the basis of the accumulated compounded<br /><br />
net cash flow for each Contract Area, using the following procedure:<br /><br />
(a)  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s net cash flow for a Contract Area for each Quarter is: <br /><br />
   <br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
The sum of the Contractor’s Cost Oil and share of Contract Area Profit<br /><br />
Oil regarding the Petroleum actually lifted in that Quarter at the<br /><br />
Realizable Price;<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
Minus Operating Costs;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For this computation, neither any expenditure incurred prior to the date of<br /><br />
Commercial Discovery for a Contract Area nor any Exploration Expenditure<br /><br />
shall be included in the computation of the Contractor’s net cash flow.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s net cash flows for each Quarter are compounded and<br /><br />
accumulated for a Contract Area from the date of the Commercial Discovery<br /><br />
according to the following formula:<br /><br />
ACNCF (Current Quarter) =<br /><br />
(100% + DQ) x ACNCF (Previous Quarter) + NCF (Current Quarter) 100%<br /><br />
where:<br /><br />
ACNCF = accumulated compounded net cash flow<br /><br />
NCF = net cash flow<br /><br />
<br /><br />
DQ = quarterly compound rate (in percent)<br /><br />
The formula will be calculated using quarterly compound rates (in percent) of<br /><br />
4.44%, 5.09%, 5.95%, and 6.57%, which correspond to annual compound rates<br /><br />
(“DA”) of 19%, 22%, 26%, and 29%, respectively.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s rate of return in any given Quarter for a Contract Area shall<br /><br />
be deemed to be between the largest DA which yields a positive or zero<br /><br />
ACNCF and the smallest DA which causes the ACNCF to be negative.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The sharing of Profit Oil from a Contract Area between the State and the<br /><br />
Contractor in a given Quarter shall be in accordance with the scale in clause<br /><br />
19<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1 (d) above using the Contractor’s deemed rate of return as per clause 10.2<br /><br />
(c) in the immediately preceding Quarter.<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In a given Contract Area, it is possible for the Contractor’s deemed rate of<br /><br />
return to decline as a result of negative cash flow in a Quarter with the<br /><br />
consequence that Contractor’s share of Profit Oil from that Contract Area<br /><br />
would increase in the subsequent Quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pending finalization of accounts, Profit Oil from the Contract Area shall be<br /><br />
shared on the basis of provisional estimates, if necessary, of a deemed rate of<br /><br />
return as approved by the National Petroleum Agency. Adjustments shall be<br /><br />
effected with the procedure subsequently to be adopted by the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The quantum of Available Crude Oil to be allocated to each Party under this Contract<br /><br />
shall be determined at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each Party shall lift and dispose of its allocation of Available Crude Oil in accordance<br /><br />
with the Allocation and Lifting Procedures as provided in Schedule 3. In the event of<br /><br />
any reconciliation, the records of the National Petroleum Agency shall be the official,<br /><br />
final and binding records.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Allocation of Royalty Oil and Profit Oil shall be in the form of delivery of Production<br /><br />
of Petroleum to the National Petroleum Agency and the National Petroleum Agency or<br /><br />
other appropriate authority shall issue receipts for such delivery within thirty (30) days<br /><br />
of lifting such Royalty Oil and Profit Oil. These receipts are issued by the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency or other appropriate authority on behalf of the Government of Sao<br /><br />
Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any Party may, at the request of any other Party, lift such other Party’s Available<br /><br />
Crude Oil pursuant to Clause 10.3, and the lifting Party within thirty (30) days shall<br /><br />
transfer to the account of the non-lifting Party, the Proceeds of the sale to which the<br /><br />
non-lifting Party is entitled. Overdue payments shall bear interest at the rate of<br /><br />
LIBOR plus two percent (2%).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The State may sell to the Contractor all or any portion of its allocation of Available<br /><br />
Crude Oil from the Contract Area under mutually agreed terms and conditions at the<br /><br />
Realizable Price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Parties shall meet as and when agreed in the Allocation and Lifting Procedures to<br /><br />
reconcile all Petroleum produced, allocated and lifted during the period in accordance<br /><br />
with the Allocation and Lifting Procedures set forth in Schedule 3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of lifting the State's Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil,<br /><br />
the State, upon one hundred eighty (180) days advance notice to the Operator, issued<br /><br />
by the National Petroleum Agency, may elect to receive the State’s allocation of Profit<br /><br />
Oil and/or Royalty Oil in cash based on the Realizable Price rather than through<br /><br />
lifting, regardless of whether or not the Contractor sells the State's Profit Oil and/or<br /><br />
Royalty Oil to a third party. If the State elects to receive cash in lieu of lifting, the<br /><br />
Operator shall lift the State's allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil and pay into<br /><br />
20<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the National Petroleum Account cash in respect of such lifting within thirty (30) days<br /><br />
from the end of the month in which the lifting occurred. Every six (6) months, the<br /><br />
State may elect to have an entity designated by the State to resume lifting the State’s<br /><br />
allocation of Profit Oil and/or Royalty Oil upon one hundred eighty (180) days’ notice<br /><br />
to the Operator prior to the date the State elects to have an entity designated by the<br /><br />
State to resume lifting. In the event the State elects to receive its allocation of Profit<br /><br />
Oil and or/Royalty Oil in cash, then the Contractor may charge a marketing fee to be<br /><br />
mutually agreed.<br /><br />
11.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
VALUATION OF CRUDE OIL<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The valuation of Crude Oil shall reflect the true market value based on arm´s<br /><br />
length transactions for the sale of the Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Save as otherwise provided in this Contract, Crude Oil Production shall be valued in<br /><br />
accordance with the following procedures:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On the attainment of commercial production of Crude Oil, each Party shall<br /><br />
engage the services of an independent laboratory of good repute to undertake a<br /><br />
qualitative and quantitative analysis of such Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a new Crude Oil stream is produced, a trial marketing period shall be<br /><br />
designated which shall extend for the first six (6) month period during which<br /><br />
such new stream is lifted or for the period of time required for the first ten (10)<br /><br />
liftings, whichever is longer. During the trial marketing period the Parties<br /><br />
shall:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
collect samples of the new Crude Oil upon which the qualitative and<br /><br />
quantitative analysis shall be performed as provided in Clause 11.2(a);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
determine the approximate quality of the new Crude Oil by estimating<br /><br />
the yield values from refinery modeling;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
market in accordance with their entitlement to the new Crude Oil and to<br /><br />
the extent that one Party lifts the other Party’s allocation of Available<br /><br />
Crude Oil, and payments therefore, shall be made by the buyers to the<br /><br />
Operator who will be responsible for distributing to the other Parties in<br /><br />
accordance with their entitlement, Cost Oil and Profit Oil and the<br /><br />
Contractor's accounting shall reflect such revenues, in accordance with<br /><br />
Clause 10;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provide information to a third party who shall compile the information<br /><br />
and maintain all individual Party information confidential, with regard<br /><br />
to the marketing of the new Crude Oil, including documents which<br /><br />
verify the sales price and terms of each lifting; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
apply the actual F.O.B. sales price to determine the value for each lifting<br /><br />
which F.O.B. sales pricing for each lifting shall continue, as the<br /><br />
Realizable Price, after the trial marketing period until the Parties agree<br /><br />
21<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to a valuation of the new Crude Oil but in no event longer than ninety<br /><br />
(90) days after conclusion of the trial marketing period.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As soon as practicable but in any event not later than sixty (60) days after the<br /><br />
end of the trial marketing period, the Parties shall meet to review the qualitative<br /><br />
and quantitative analysis, yield and actual sales data. Each Party may present a<br /><br />
proposal for the valuation of the new Crude Oil. A valuation formula for the<br /><br />
Realizable Price shall be agreed to by the Parties not later than nine (9) months<br /><br />
after the first lifting. It is the intent of the Parties that such prices shall reflect<br /><br />
the true market value based on arm’s length transactions for the sale of the new<br /><br />
Crude Oil. The valuation formula, as determined hereinbefore (including the<br /><br />
product yield values), shall be mutually agreed within thirty (30) days of the<br /><br />
aforementioned meeting, failing which, it shall be referred to a mutually agreed<br /><br />
independent expert who shall have the appropriate international oil and gas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
experience and who will resolve and settle the matter in a manner as he shall in<br /><br />
his absolute discretion think fit and the decision of the expert shall be final and<br /><br />
binding on the Parties. If, after a period of thirty (30) days, the Parties are<br /><br />
unable to agree on the identity of the expert, such expert shall be appointed by<br /><br />
the International Centre for Expertise in accordance with the provisions for the<br /><br />
appointment of experts under the Rules for Expertise of the International<br /><br />
Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon the conclusion of the trial marketing period, the Parties shall be entitled to<br /><br />
lift their allocation of Available Crude Oil pursuant to Clause 10.3 and the<br /><br />
Allocation and Lifting Procedures set forth in Schedule 3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When a new Crude Oil stream is produced from the Contract Area and is<br /><br />
commingled with an existing Crude Oil produced which has an established<br /><br />
Realizable Price basis then such basis shall be applied to the extent practicable<br /><br />
for determining the Realizable Price of the new Crude Oil. The Parties shall<br /><br />
meet and mutually agree on any appropriate modifications to such established<br /><br />
valuation basis, which may be required to reflect any change in the market<br /><br />
value of the Crude Oils as a result of commingling.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If in the opinion of either the National Petroleum Agency or the Contractor an agreed<br /><br />
price valuation method fails to reflect the market value of Crude Oil produced in the<br /><br />
Contract Area, then such Party may propose to the other Party modifications to such<br /><br />
valuation method once in every six (6) months but in no event more than twice in any<br /><br />
Calendar Year. The Parties shall then meet within thirty (30) days of such proposal<br /><br />
and mutually agree on any modifications to such valuation within thirty (30) days<br /><br />
from such meeting, failing which, the issue shall be referred to a mutually agreed<br /><br />
independent expert who shall have the appropriate international oil and gas experience<br /><br />
and who will resolve and settle the matter in a manner as he shall in his absolute<br /><br />
discretion think fit and the decision of the expert shall be final and binding on the<br /><br />
Parties. If after a period of thirty (30) days, the Parties are unable to agree on the<br /><br />
identity of the expert, such expert shall be appointment by the International Centre for<br /><br />
Expertise in accordance with the provisions for the appointment of experts under the<br /><br />
Rules for Expertise of the International Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Segregation of Crude Oils of different quality and/or grade shall, by agreement of the<br /><br />
Parties, take into consideration, among other things, the operational practicality of<br /><br />
segregation and the cost benefit analysis thereof. If the Parties agree on such<br /><br />
segregation the following provisions shall apply:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any and all provisions of this Contract concerning valuation of Crude Oil shall<br /><br />
separately apply to each segregated Crude Oil produced; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
each grade or quality of Crude Oil produced and segregated in a given year<br /><br />
shall contribute its proportionate share to the total quantity designated in such<br /><br />
year as Royalty Oil, Cost Oil and Profit Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Crude Oil is sold to a verifiable independent third party, the actual F.O.B sales<br /><br />
price for each lifting shall, for the purpose of calculation of the sales price under this<br /><br />
Contract, constitute the Realizable Price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PAYMENTS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall make all payments to the State, for which it is liable under this<br /><br />
Contract, in United States dollars or such other currency agreed between the<br /><br />
Contractor and the National Petroleum Agency. Payments shall be made into the<br /><br />
National Petroleum Account in accordance with the Oil Revenue Law. Where a<br /><br />
payment is made in currency other than United States dollars, the exchange rate used<br /><br />
to convert the United States dollars liability into that currency shall be the exchange<br /><br />
rate published on the date of payment by the Central Bank of Sao Tome and Principe<br /><br />
for Dobras and the Financial Times of London for other currencies. Overdue payments<br /><br />
shall bear interest at the annual rate of LIBOR plus two percent (2%) from the due<br /><br />
date until the date of actual payment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The State shall make all payments to the Contractor for which it is liable under this<br /><br />
Contract in United States dollars or such other currency agreed between the Contractor<br /><br />
and the National Petroleum Agency. Where a payment is made in a currency other<br /><br />
than United States dollars, the exchange rate used to convert the United States dollar<br /><br />
liability into that currency shall be the exchange rate published on the date of payment<br /><br />
by the Central Bank of Sao Tome and Principe for Dobras, and the Financial Times of<br /><br />
London for other currencies. Overdue payments shall bear interest at the annual rate of<br /><br />
LIBOR plus two percent (2%) from the due date until the date of actual payment.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any payments required to be made pursuant to this Contract shall be made within ten<br /><br />
(10) days following the end of the month in which the obligation to make such<br /><br />

13.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
TITLE TO EQUIPMENT / DECOMMISSIONING<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall finance the cost of purchasing or leasing all materials, equipment<br /><br />
and facilities to be used in Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area pursuant to<br /><br />
approved Work Programs and Budgets and such materials, equipment and facilities, if<br /><br />
purchased, shall become the sole property of the State when the Contractor has<br /><br />
recovered the cost of such materials, equipment and facilities (as the case may be) in<br /><br />
accordance with this Contract or upon its termination, whichever occurs first, free of<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
all liens and other encumbrances. Except as otherwise provided for in the Petroleum<br /><br />
Law, the Contractor and the State, including the National Petroleum Agency, shall<br /><br />
have the right to use all materials, equipment and facilities exclusively for Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations in the Contract Area during the term of this Contract and any extensions<br /><br />
thereof. Should the State or the National Petroleum Agency desire to use such<br /><br />
materials, equipment and facilities outside the Contract Area, such use shall be subject<br /><br />
to terms and conditions agreed by the Parties, provided that it is understood that<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in the Contract Area hereunder shall take precedence over such<br /><br />
use by the State or the National Petroleum Agency. The Contractor shall only lease<br /><br />
materials, equipment and facilities with the approval of the National Petroleum<br /><br />
Agency, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld if such lease is in the best<br /><br />
interest of the Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
13.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s right to use such purchased materials, equipment and facilities shall<br /><br />
cease with the termination or expiration (whichever is earlier) of this Contract,<br /><br />
including any extensions hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The provisions of Clause 13.1, with respect to the title of property passing to the State,<br /><br />
shall not apply to leased equipment belonging to local or foreign third parties, and<br /><br />
such equipment may be freely exported from the Territory of Sao Tome and Principe,<br /><br />
in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to Clause 13.2, all fixed assets purchased or otherwise acquired by the<br /><br />
Contractor for the purposes of Petroleum Operations hereunder, shall become the<br /><br />
property of the State when the Contractor has recovered the cost of such materials,<br /><br />
equipment and facilities (as the case may be) in accordance with this Contract or upon<br /><br />
its termination, whichever occurs first. Upon termination of this Contract, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall hand over possession of such fixed assets to the State in good<br /><br />
working order and free of all liens and other encumbrances.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the term of this Contract, any agreed sales of equipment, land, fixed assets,<br /><br />
materials and machinery acquired for the purpose of Petroleum Operations shall be<br /><br />

in Schedule 5, subject to the consent of the National Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning<br /><br />
The expenditure for Decommissioning will be estimated on the basis of technical<br /><br />
studies undertaken by the Contractor, to be agreed by the National Petroleum Agency,<br /><br />
as part of each Field Development Program and revised as necessary.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise agreed by the National Petroleum Agency, the procedure for the<br /><br />
Contractor providing funds to meet its Decommissioning obligations shall be as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
an amount shall be established on a Contract Area basis, commencing two<br /><br />
years after the start of the Production Period, on a unit of production basis as<br /><br />

property. Any excess cost of repair or replacement above the amount reimbursed by<br /><br />
the insurance company shall be regarded as an Operating Cost. If the cost of repair is<br /><br />
less than the amount reimbursed by the insurance company, the difference shall be<br /><br />
deducted from Operating Costs. If the decision is to neither repair nor replace then the<br /><br />
proceeds of any coverage shall be credited to Operating Costs. In the event that the<br /><br />

(j)<br /><br />
20.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the events provided for in the articles 34, 35 or 36 of the Petroleum Law.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the cause for termination is an event specified in Clause 20.1(a), (b), (f), (g), (h), (i)<br /><br />
and/or (j) above, the National Petroleum Agency shall give written notice thereof to<br /><br />
the Contractor requiring it to remedy such default within a period not more than thirty<br /><br />
(30) days of receipt of the National Petroleum Agency’s notice or such additional days<br /><br />
as the National Petroleum Agency deems appropriate in the circumstances in its sole<br /><br />
discretion. If upon the expiration of the said period, such default has not been<br /><br />
<br /><br />
remedied or removed, the Government may, by written notice issued by the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency to the Contractor, declare this Contract terminated.<br /><br />
20.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Termination for any of the events specified in Clause 20.1(c), (d) and/or (e) above,<br /><br />
shall be with immediate effect and the Government may, by written notice to the<br /><br />
33<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor issued by the National Petroleum Agency, declare this Contract terminated.<br /><br />
Termination as to one Contractor Party shall not constitute termination as to the other<br /><br />
Contractor Party(ies).<br /><br />
20.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where this Contract is terminated with respect to only one Contractor Party, the State<br /><br />
shall have the option to assume the interests, rights and obligations of such defaulting<br /><br />
Contractor Party under this Contract. If the State elects not to exercise this option, the<br /><br />
interests, rights and obligations shall be assigned to the remaining Contractor Parties<br /><br />
who shall be liable jointly and severally.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that the other Contractor Party(ies) fail to meet any and all liabilities of<br /><br />
the terminated Contractor Party as provided in Clause 20.4, the State reserves the right<br /><br />
to terminate this Contract, in respect of all other Contractor Parties upon written<br /><br />
notice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Without prejudice to all other rights of the State, the Contractor shall upon the<br /><br />
termination of this Contract permit inspection, copying and auditing of its accounts<br /><br />
and records for the Petroleum Operations by the National Petroleum Agency and/or its<br /><br />
agents.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to relinquish its rights and to<br /><br />
terminate this Contract without further obligations or liabilities, upon completion of<br /><br />
the stipulated Minimum Work Obligations and Minimum Financial Commitment at<br /><br />
the end of any phase of the Exploration Period, upon giving a thirty (30) day advance<br /><br />
notice to the National Petroleum Agency. This Clause 20.7 shall not release the<br /><br />
Contractor from any unfulfilled obligations incurred prior to the termination of this<br /><br />
Contract, nor from any liabilities arising from acts or omissions taking place prior to<br /><br />
the termination of this Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
20.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Contract shall automatically terminate if no Commercial Discovery is made in<br /><br />
the Contract Area at the end of Exploration Period, as extended.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
FORCE MAJEURE<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any failure or delay on the part of any Party in the performance of its obligations or<br /><br />
duties (other than the obligation to pay money) under this Contract shall be excused to<br /><br />
the extent attributable to Force Majeure. A Force Majeure situation includes delays,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
defaults or inability to perform under this Contract due to any event beyond the<br /><br />
reasonable control of the Party claiming Force Majeure. Such event may be, but is not<br /><br />
limited to, any act, event, happening or occurrence due to natural causes and acts or<br /><br />
perils of navigation, fire, hostilities, war (whether declared or undeclared), blockade,<br /><br />
labor disturbances, strikes riots, insurrection, civil commotion, quarantine restrictions,<br /><br />
epidemics, storms, floods, earthquakes, accidents, blowouts and lightning.<br /><br />
21.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unlawful acts of Government are also considered to constitute Force Majeure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If Petroleum Operations are delayed, curtailed or prevented by an event of Force<br /><br />
Majeure, then the time for carrying out the obligation and duties thereby affected, and<br /><br />
rights and obligations hereunder, shall be extended for a period equal to the period of<br /><br />
such delay.<br /><br />
34<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Party who is unable to perform its obligations as a result of the Force Majeure<br /><br />
shall promptly notify the other Parties not later than forty-eight (48) hours after the<br /><br />
establishment of the commencement of the event of Force Majeure, stating the cause,<br /><br />
and the Parties shall do all that is reasonably within their powers to remove such<br /><br />
cause.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
21.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor’s failure or inability to find Petroleum in commercial quantities for<br /><br />
reasons other than as specified in Clause 21.1 shall not be deemed an event of Force<br /><br />
Majeure.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
LAWS AND REGULATIONS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the<br /><br />
Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
22.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to principles of public international law, no term of this Contract, including<br /><br />
the agreement of the Parties to submit to arbitration hereunder, shall prevent or limit<br /><br />
the State from exercising its sovereign rights.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
NATURAL GAS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor discovers a commercially viable quantity of Natural Gas, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall have the right to develop, commercialize, recover the costs and share<br /><br />
in the profits of a development of such Natural Gas under this Contract on terms to be<br /><br />
mutually agreed. Such terms when agreed shall become an integral part of this<br /><br />
Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding Clause 23.1, the Contractor may utilize, at no cost, Natural Gas<br /><br />
required as fuel for Petroleum Operations such as gas recycling, gas injection, gas lift<br /><br />
<br /><br />
or any other Crude Oil enhancing recovery schemes, stimulation of wells necessary<br /><br />
for maximum Crude Oil recovery in the field discovered and developed by the<br /><br />
Contractor and such usage shall be with prior written consent of the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This shall be<br /><br />
included in a Field Development Program.<br /><br />
23.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The attainment of recovery of Crude Oil through an efficient, economic and<br /><br />
technically acceptable method shall always be paramount in all decisions regarding<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas. However, prior to the commencement of Production of Crude<br /><br />
Oil from the Contract Area, the Contractor shall submit to the National Petroleum<br /><br />
Agency, a program for the utilization of any Associated Natural Gas that has been<br /><br />
discovered in the Contract Area, which shall be subject to the approval of the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
23.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor discovers sufficient volumes of Unassociated Natural Gas that could<br /><br />
justify commercial development, the Contractor shall immediately report the volume<br /><br />
of potentially recoverable Natural Gas to the National Petroleum Agency and shall<br /><br />
promptly investigate and submit proposals to the National Petroleum Agency for the<br /><br />
commercial development of such Natural Gas taking in consideration local strategic<br /><br />
needs as may be identified by the National Petroleum Agency, within two (2) years of<br /><br />
35<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the date of the relevant discovery. Any cost in respect of such proposals or<br /><br />
investigation presented by the Contractor to the National Petroleum Agency shall be<br /><br />
included in Operating Costs. The Contractor and the National Petroleum Agency will<br /><br />
determine the plan and time needed, which shall be no more than five (5) years, unless<br /><br />
otherwise agreed by the National Petroleum Agency, to progress a commercial<br /><br />
development project, which shall include the terms for recovery of Operating Costs<br /><br />
and sharing of Natural Gas production, which terms when agreed shall form an<br /><br />
integral part of this Contract. If the Contractor fails to justify a commercial<br /><br />
development within the agreed timeframe and if the National Petroleum Agency<br /><br />
determines that a sufficient volume of Unassociated Natural Gas exists, the National<br /><br />
Petroleum Agency shall have the right to propose to the Contractor a commercial<br /><br />
development of such Natural Gas. The Contractor shall have the right to participate in<br /><br />
the commercial development under terms pursuant to Clause 23.1. If the Contractor<br /><br />
declines to participate in the commercial development of such Natural Gas as<br /><br />
presented by the National Petroleum Agency and if the Field Development Program<br /><br />
does not hinder or jeopardize current Petroleum Operations, the National Petroleum<br /><br />
Agency may develop the Natural Gas in the manner presented to the Contractor.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
25.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Should there be a difference or dispute between the Parties concerning the<br /><br />
interpretation or performance of this Contract (a "Dispute") such that the Dispute<br /><br />
cannot be resolved by mutual agreement, the Parties may refer the matter to an<br /><br />
independent expert for an opinion to assist the Parties in reaching a mutual agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where an independent expert is used, the National Petroleum Agency and the<br /><br />

under any other procedure, agreement or international treaty shall have jurisdiction<br /><br />
over such Disputes between the Parties.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the relevant Parties have not reached a mutual agreement after three (3) months of<br /><br />
the date of a notice of a Dispute by one Party to another, unless the Parties to the<br /><br />
Dispute mutually agree to an extension, any Party to the Dispute may refer the Dispute<br /><br />
for resolution by final and binding arbitration to the International Centre for the<br /><br />
Settlement of Investment Disputes (the "Centre") established by the Convention on<br /><br />
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States,<br /><br />
done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (the "ICSID Convention"); or to the Additional<br /><br />

this Contract as are necessary to restore as near as practicable such commercial<br /><br />
benefits which existed under this Contract as of the Effective Date.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
27.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The terms, other than the terms that comprise the Biddable terms of this Contract,<br /><br />
shall not be materially more burdensome to the Contractor than the terms of other<br /><br />

<br /><br />
blocks in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sao Tome and Principe offered in the first<br /><br />
licensing<br /><br />
39<br /><br />
<br /><br />
round after the Effective Date of this Contract. If another contractor agrees such<br /><br />
materially less burdensome terms with the State, then this Contract shall be amended<br /><br />
to reflect the less burdensome terms agreed with the other contractor.<br /><br />
27.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Contract shall not be amended or modified in any respect except by mutual<br /><br />
consent, in writing, of the Parties hereto.<br /><br />

within a range of plus or minus five percent (5%) by the Party so nominating;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the tanker’s name or To Be Named (TBN) for each tanker lifting. Tanker<br /><br />
nomination made as TBN shall be replaced at least five (5) working days prior<br /><br />
to the accepted date range, unless a shorter time is acceptable to the<br /><br />
Contractor; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
documentation instructions shall be given for each lifting not later than four (4)<br /><br />
days prior to the first day of the accepted date range for the tanker in question.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tanker Substitution<br /><br />
A Party may substitute another tanker to lift its nominated volume of Crude Oil,<br /><br />
provided such substituted tanker has the same arrival date range as the originally<br /><br />
scheduled tanker and all other provisions of this Allocation and Lifting Procedure are<br /><br />
complied with.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Overlapping Date Ranges<br /><br />
In the event the combined lifting schedule contains overlapping accepted date ranges,<br /><br />
56<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the tanker which gives its Notice of Readiness (NOR) has provided all documentation<br /><br />
and obtained clearances first within such accepted date ranges shall be loaded first,<br /><br />
unless urgent operational requirements dictate otherwise in which case, demurrage<br /><br />
shall be borne by Petroleum Operations and charged to Operating Costs.<br /><br />
5.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Confirmation of Lifting Schedules<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At least fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of a calendar month, the Contractor<br /><br />
shall either confirm the feasibility of the proposed monthly lifting schedules or,<br /><br />
alternatively, advise of necessary modifications to such schedules. Such confirmation<br /><br />
which shall be in the form of a combined lifting schedule should include a loading<br /><br />
date range of three (3) days for each lifting, the first day being the earliest date of<br /><br />
arrival and the third day being the latest date of arrival.<br /><br />
5.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Operational Delays<br /><br />
The Parties recognize that occasionally environmental and technical problems in the<br /><br />
Contract Area may cause delays and/or disruptions in the combined lifting schedule.<br /><br />
The Contractor shall promptly notify the National Petroleum Agency of such delays<br /><br />
and/or disruptions, the projected termination of each of such delays and/or disruptions<br /><br />
and advise the National Petroleum Agency of the revised combined lifting schedule.<br /><br />
In the event such notification does not allow for a revised combined lifting schedule<br /><br />
on the part of the National Petroleum Agency, then any resultant costs will be charged<br /><br />
to Operating Costs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Estimated Delayed Arrival of a Tanker<br /><br />
Whenever it becomes apparent that a tanker will not be available as scheduled or will<br /><br />
be delayed, the Party utilizing such tanker shall notify the other Party(ies) of the<br /><br />
circumstances and expected duration of the delay. Upon assessing the impact that the<br /><br />
Delay will have upon the combined lifting schedule and production during the current<br /><br />
and/or next month, the Contractor shall make appropriate revision(s) to the combined<br /><br />
lifting schedule to avoid disruption in production. In the event that any Party fails to<br /><br />
lift its nominated share of production in any month/quarter due to circumstances<br /><br />
beyond the Party’s control or difficulties in maintaining the lifting schedule, that Party<br /><br />
shall have the right during the following quarter/month to lift the unlifted quantities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Tanker Standards<br /><br />
