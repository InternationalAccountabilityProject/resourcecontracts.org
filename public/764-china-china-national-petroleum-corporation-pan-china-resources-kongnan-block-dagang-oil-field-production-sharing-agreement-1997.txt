adopt the annual Work Program and budget as submitted or make such modifications agreed by the               <br /><br /><br />
Parties. The adopted annual Work Program and budget shall be submitted to CNPC for review and                <br /><br /><br />
approval within one (1) month as of the date on which they are submitted to JMC. Within fifteen (15)         <br /><br /><br />
days following the receipt of the annual Work Program and budget, CNPC shall notify JMC in writing           <br /><br /><br />
of its approval or disapproval or any modifications thereto with its detailed reasons. If CNPC requests      <br /><br /><br />
any modifications to the aforesaid annual Work Program and budget, the Parties shall promptly hold           <br /><br /><br />
meetings to make modifications and any modifications agreed upon by the Parties shall be effected            <br /><br /><br />
immediately. In case CNPC fails to notify JMC in writing of its approval or disapproval or any               <br /><br /><br />
modification within fifteen (15) days, the annual Work Program and budget adopted by JMC shall be            <br /><br /><br />
deemed to have been approved by CNPC. The Operator shall make its best efforts to perform the                <br /><br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in accordance with the approved or modified annual Work Program and budget.             <br /><br /><br />
As required for reviewing Work Program and budget by JMC, the Operator shall submit to                       <br /><br /><br />
JMC the supporting data as detailed as possible.                                                             <br /><br /><br />
10.2    The Operator may, in accordance with the following provisions, incur excess                          <br /><br /><br />
expenditures or expenditures outside the budget in carrying out the Work Program and budget,                 <br /><br /><br />
provided that the objectives of the approved Work Program and budget are not changed.                        <br /><br /><br />
10.2.1    In carrying out an approved budget for a single item, such as the drilling of a well, the          <br /><br /><br />
Operator may, if necessary, incur excess expenditures of no more than ten percent (10%) of the               <br /><br /><br />
budgeted amount. The Operator shall report quarterly the aggregate amount of all such excess                 <br /><br /><br />
expenditures to JMC for confirmation.                                                                        <br /><br /><br />
10.2.2    For the efficient performance of the Petroleum Operations, the Operator may, without               <br /><br /><br />
approval, undertake certain individual projects which are not included in the Work Program and               <br /><br /><br />
budget, for a maximum expenditure of One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S.$100,000), but the               <br /><br /><br />
Operator shall, within ten (10) days after such expenditures are incurred, report to JMC for                 <br /><br /><br />
confirmation. In case of emergency, the Operator may incur emergency expenditures for the amount             <br /><br /><br />
actually needed but shall report such expenditures to JMC as soon as they are made. However, the             <br /><br /><br />
said emergency expenditures shall not be subject to Articles 10.2.3 and 10.2.4 herein.                       <br /><br /><br />
10.2.3    In the event that the aggregate of excess expenditures under Article 10.2.1 herein and             <br /><br /><br />
expenditures under Article 10.2.2 herein incurred in a Calendar Year cause the total expenditures of         <br /><br /><br />
that Calendar Year to exceed the approved annual budget, such excess shall not exceed five percent           <br /><br /><br />
(5%) of the approved annual budget for that Calendar Year. If the aforesaid excess is expected to be         <br /><br /><br />
in excess of five percent (5%) of the annual budget, the Operator shall present its reasons therefore to     <br /><br /><br />
JMC and obtain its approval prior to incurring such expenditures.                                            <br /><br /><br />

(a)    if expenditures or excess expenditures are determined to be reasonable, the Operator         <br /><br /><br />
may incur such expenditures or excess expenditures again during the same Calendar Year subject to   <br /><br /><br />

Operator shall not incur such expenditures or excess expenditures again during the same Calendar    <br /><br /><br />
Year and such unreasonable expenditures or excess expenditures shall be dealt with in accordance    <br /><br /><br />

14.3.1 The price of various grades of the Crude Oil shall be expressed as a FOB price at the                  <br /><br /><br />
Delivery Point. Determination of the Crude Oil price shall be made with reference to the prevailing           <br /><br /><br />
price in arm's length transactions of similar quality Crude Oil on the main world oil markets and the         <br /><br /><br />
adjustment in such price shall be made in accordance with such determinants as the quality of the             <br /><br /><br />

﻿The aforesaid price in arm's length transactions in this Article refers to a price at which a                 <br /><br /><br />
seller sells its crude oil to a buyer who is independent of the seller, but not including the prices used     <br /><br /><br />
by them for government to government transactions which do not reflect international oil market               <br /><br /><br />
price, Crude Oil exchange, or barter transactions.                                                            <br /><br /><br />
14.3.2    Subject to the agreement of Parties, where the Crude Oil produced from the Oil Field                <br /><br /><br />
within the Contract Area differs in grades, the prices of such Crude Oil with different quality will be       <br /><br /><br />
individually determined.                                                                                      <br /><br /><br />
14.3.3    The price of the Crude Oil produced from the Oil Field within the Contract Area shall               <br /><br /><br />
be denominated in U.S. Dollars per metric ton. However, if an international currency other than the           <br /><br /><br />
U.S. Dollar prevails on the main world oil markets as the pricing unit of Crude Oil, the Parties may          <br /><br /><br />
also use that international currency therefore upon mutual agreement.                                         <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4    Procedure for the Determination of the Crude Oil Price                                              <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.1    The Crude Oil price shall be determined once each Calendar Quarter. In case                       <br /><br /><br />
the Crude Oil price prevailing on most world oil markets fluctuates, CNPC and the Contractor each             <br /><br /><br />
shall have the right to propose, at any time, that a new Crude Oil price be negotiated and determined.        <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.2    The Contractor shall, no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the                             <br /><br /><br />
commencement of any Calendar Quarter, notify CNPC of its proposed price for Crude Oil to be lifted            <br /><br /><br />
in such Calendar Quarter (for the purpose of this Article hereafter referred to as the said Calendar          <br /><br /><br />
Quarter).                                                                                                     <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.3    CNPC shall notify the Contractor of its decided price within ten (10) days                        <br /><br /><br />
after the receipt of the aforesaid proposed price notified by the Contractor. In the absence of a             <br /><br /><br />
different price notified by CNPC to the Contractor within ten (10) days after the receipt of the              <br /><br /><br />
aforesaid notification, the proposed price notified by the Contractor as referred to in Article 14.3.4.2      <br /><br /><br />
herein shall be applied to the Crude Oil to be lifted in the said Calendar Quarter.                           <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.4    The Contractor shall, within five (5) days following its receipt of notice of a                   <br /><br /><br />
price decided by CNPC, state to CNPC whether the price is acceptable. If it is acceptable, then the           <br /><br /><br />
said decided price shall be regarded as the price agreed upon by the Parties for the said Calendar            <br /><br /><br />
Quarter. If it is not acceptable, the Parties shall, within ten (10) days, carry out further negotiation in   <br /><br /><br />
an amicable manner to determine the price for the said Calendar Quarter.                                      <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.5    In the event that the Parties still cannot reach an agreement on the Crude Oil                    <br /><br /><br />
price for the said Calendar Quarter through further negotiations by the Parties, the Contractor may lift      <br /><br /><br />
the Crude Oil in accordance with the quota specified for the said Calendar Quarter in Article 13.2            <br /><br /><br />
hereof, and the Crude Oil price for the preceding Calendar Quarter shall apply provisionally to the           <br /><br /><br />
Crude Oil of such quota and the payment shall be made accordingly. Then, the Parties shall negotiate          <br /><br /><br />
further on the Crude Oil price for the said Calendar Quarter, taking into account relevant independent        <br /><br /><br />
and non-proprietary market data on Third Party sales of Crude Oil in substantial quantities on the            <br /><br /><br />
main world oil markets, adjusted for quality, transportation and other applicable differentials. The          <br /><br /><br />
Parties shall each take into account the information supplied and discussed and attempt to agree on a         <br /><br /><br />
Crude Oil price based upon such information by the end of the said Calendar Quarter.                          <br /><br /><br />
(1) In the event that the Parties still cannot reach an agreement in Crude Oil price by the                   <br /><br /><br />
end of the said Calendar Quarter, then the Crude Oil price shall be the weighted average FOB price of         <br /><br /><br />
the Crude Oil of the same or similar quality sold by CNPC and/or the Contractor to a Third Party or           <br /><br /><br />

(ii)    In the event no sales as referred to in paragraph (i) above were made in the said                      <br /><br /><br />
Calendar Quarter, the price, calculated and determined in accordance with the above mentioned                  <br /><br /><br />
stipulations, of the Crude Oil produced from other Oil Field in the Contract Area and sold to a Third          <br /><br /><br />

(2)    In the event there are no such Third Party sales of the Crude Oil as referred to in Article             <br /><br /><br />
14.3.4.5(1) herein during the said Calendar Quarter, then the Crude Oil price for the said Calendar            <br /><br /><br />
Quarter shall be equal to the same Crude Oil price of the preceding Calendar Quarter adjusted by the           <br /><br /><br />
differences in the arithmetic average of the average daily selling price for a basket of three or more         <br /><br /><br />
internationally traded Crude Oils in the said Calendar Quarter compared with that for such basket of           <br /><br /><br />
Crude Oils for the preceding Calendar Quarter. The adjusted price shall be the Crude Oil price for the         <br /><br /><br />
said Calendar Quarter. The Crude Oils selected for the basket shall each be similar in quality to the          <br /><br /><br />
Crude Oil from the Contract Area and chosen from different countries and shall have prices which               <br /><br /><br />
reflect the conditions of the main world oil markets and shall be mutually agreed by the Parties in the        <br /><br /><br />
