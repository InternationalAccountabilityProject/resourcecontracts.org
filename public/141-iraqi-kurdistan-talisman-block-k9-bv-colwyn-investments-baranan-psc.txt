        Exploration Well”), committing for this purpose <br /><br />
        a minimum financial amount of approximately ten    <br /><br />
        million Dollars (US$10,000,000).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.3 During the Second Sub-Period, the CONTRACTOR shall:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a) acquire, process and interpret further seismic data <br /><br />
    (being either two dimensional or three dimensional), <br /><br />
    if the CONTRACTOR considers that, the results from <br /><br />
    the First Exploration Well justify the acquisition <br /><br />
    of further seismic data; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b) drill one (I) Exploration Well (the “Second <br /><br />
    Exploration Well") committing for this purpose a <br /><br />
    minimum financial amount of ten million Dollars <br /><br />
    (US$ 10,000.000), unless the data from the first <br /><br />
    exploration Well demonstrates to the CONTRACTOR <br /><br />
    acting reasonably that there is not a reasonable <br /><br />
    technical cause for drilling the Second Exploration <br /><br />
    Wells in the Contract Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                         29<br /><br />
10.4 Notwithstanding the provisions in Articles 10.2 to <br /><br />
     10.3 for the execution of the Minimum Exploration <br /><br />
     Obligations under Articles 10.2 to 10.3, it is <br /><br />
     agreed as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (a) Minimum Exploration Obligations in the Second <br /><br />
         Sub-Period shall only apply in the event the <br /><br />
         CONTRACTOR has not elected to notify the <br /><br />
         GOVERNMENT that it will not enter into the <br /><br />
         Second Sub-Period. in accordance with and <br /><br />
         subject to Article 6.4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (b) Subject to Article 10.4(a), the CONTRACTOR <br /><br />
         shall be required to meet its Minimum <br /><br />
         Exploration Obligations for the applicable Sub-<br /><br />
         Period, even if this entails exceeding the <br /><br />
         Minimum Financial Commitment for such Sub-<br /><br />
         Period. If the CONTRACTOR has satisfied its <br /><br />
         Minimum Exploration Obligations without having <br /><br />
         spent the total Minimum Financial Commitment <br /><br />
         for such Sub-Period, it shall be deemed to have <br /><br />
         satisfied its Minimum Exploration Obligations <br /><br />
         for such Sub-Period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
     (c) Each Exploration Well shall be drilled to the <br /><br />
         depth agreed by the Management Committee <br /><br />
         unless:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
         (i) the formation is encountered at a lesser <br /><br />
             depth than originally anticipated;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        (ii) basement is encountered at a lesser depth <br /><br />
             than originally anticipated;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
       (iii) in the CONTRACTOR'S sole opinion continued <br /><br />
             drilling of the relevant Exploration Well <br /><br />
             presents a hazard due to the presence of <br /><br />
             abnormal or unforeseen conditions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        (iv) insurmountable technical problems are <br /><br />
             encountered tendering it impractical to <br /><br />
             continue drilling with standard equipment; <br /><br />
             or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        (v)  petroleum formations are encountered whoso   <br /><br />
             penetration requires laying protective <br /><br />
             easing that does not enable the depth <br /><br />
             agreed by the Management Committee to be <br /><br />
             reached;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        provided, however, that in no event shall <br /><br />
        Contractor be required to drill an Exploration <br /><br />
        Well deeper than three thousand five hundred <br /><br />
        metres (3,500m).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        If drilling is stopped for any of the foregoing <br /><br />
        reasons, the Exploration Well shall be deemed to <br /><br />
        have been drilled to the depth agreed by the <br /><br />
        Management Committee and the CONTRACTOR shall be <br /><br />
        deemed to have satisfied its Minimum Exploration <br /><br />
        Obligations in respect of the Exploration Well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d) Any geological or geophysical work carried out or <br /><br />
    any seismic data acquired, processed or interpreted <br /><br />
    or any Exploration Well drilled or any other work <br /><br />
    performed in excess of the Minimum Exploration <br /><br />
    Obligations and/or any amounts spent in excess of <br /><br />
    the total Minimum Financial Commitment in any given <br /><br />
    Sub-Period, shall be earned forward to the next <br /><br />
    Sub-Period or any extension period<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                        30       and shall be taken into account to satisfy the <br /><br />
       Minimum Exploration Obligations and/or the total <br /><br />
       Minimum Financial Commitment for such subsequent <br /><br />
       Sub-Period or extension period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)    For the avoidance of doubt, if: (i) in the First <br /><br />
       Sub-Period, the CONTRACTOR performs any of the <br /><br />
       Minimum Exploration Obligations prescribed for <br /><br />
       the Second Sub-Period in Article 10.3; and (ii) <br /><br />
       the CONTRACT OR has not elected to notify the <br /><br />
       GOVERNMENT that it will not enter into the <br /><br />
       Second Sub-Period (in accordance with and subject <br /><br />
       to Article 6.4), the performance of such Minimum <br /><br />
       Exploration Obligations shall be deemed to <br /><br />
       satisfy the same Minimum Exploration Obligations <br /><br />
       for the Second Sub-Period.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
(b)	if the allocation of  the Profit Petroleum in the two Semesters is different, then the CONTRACTOR shall make any adjustments to the Parties respective shares of  Profit Petroleum to restore them to the position that they would have been in had the “R” Factor for the relevant Semester been available from the start of  such Semester.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.8 If at any time an error occurs in the calculation of  the “R” Factor, resulting in a change in the CONTRACTOR’s percentage share of  Profit Crude Oil and/or Profit Natural Gas, the necessary correction shall be made and any adjustments shall apply from the Semester in which the error occurred. The Party having benefited from a surplus of  Profit Petroleum shall surrender such surplus to the other Party, beginning from the first day of  the Semester following the Semester in which the error was recognised. However, each lifting of Petroleum relating to such error by the Party receiving the surplus shall not exceed twenty-five per cent (25%) of the share of  Profit Petroleum to which such surrendering Party is entitled. For the avoidance of  doubt if at any time an error occurs in the calculation of  the “R” Factor, which docs not result in a change in the CON TRACTOR’s percentage share of Profit Crude Oil and/or Profit Natural Gas, no correction shall be made.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.9 The quantities of  Profit Petroleum due to the CONTRACTOR shall be delivered to the CONTRACTOR entities at the Delivery Point Title and risk of  loss of  such Profit Petroleum shall be transferred to the CONTRACTOR Entities at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
