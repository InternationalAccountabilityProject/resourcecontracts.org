of 9.50% Amended Series A, Cumulative Convertible Preferred<br /><br />
Stock (the "Amended Series A Preferred Stock") of XCL Ltd.<br /><br />
(the "Company"). These shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock were originally issued in transactions intended to<br /><br />
qualify for an exemption from registration under<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities Act.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Prospectus also offers for resale in transactions<br /><br />
registered under the Securities Act, 33,592,721 shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock of the Company which have been or will be<br /><br />
issued in transactions intended to qualify for an exemption<br /><br />
from registration under the Securities Act.<br /><br />
These shares<br /><br />
include shares originally issued in transactions intended to<br /><br />
qualify for an exemption from registration under<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities<br /><br />
Act,<br /><br />
shares the Company is<br /><br />
contractually<br /><br />
obligated to issue and shares that may be issued if holders<br /><br />
of convertible preferred stock convert that stock or if<br /><br />
holders of various warrants exercise those warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In this Prospectus, the shares of Common Stock being<br /><br />
registered that will be issued when various warrants are<br /><br />
exercised are referred to as the "Warrant Shares," and the<br /><br />
warrants are referred to as the "Warrants." The shares of<br /><br />
Common<br /><br />
Stock that will be issued when the Company's<br /><br />
convertible preferred stock is converted into Common Stock<br /><br />
are referred to as the "Conversion Stock." The shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock that the Company is contractually required to<br /><br />
issue are referred to as the "Contract Stock." The Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock, Warrant Shares, Conversion Stock<br /><br />
and Contract Stock are collectively referred to as the<br /><br />
"Securities."<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Prospectus is intended for use by the holders (the<br /><br />
"Selling Security Holders") of the Securities in resale<br /><br />
transactions registered under the Securities Act.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the<br /><br />
Securities (other than proceeds upon exercise of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Warrants).<br /><br />
See "Selling Security Holders" and "Use of<br /><br />
Proceeds."<br /><br />
The Company will pay the costs of registering<br /><br />
sales of the Securities covered by this Prospectus under the<br /><br />
Securities Act and related costs (although the Selling<br /><br />
Security Holders will pay all applicable stock transfer<br /><br />
taxes, brokerage commissions or other transaction charges or<br /><br />
expenses).<br /><br />
The Company estimates that its expenses in<br /><br />
making this offering will be approximately $152,000.<br /><br />
The Common Stock is quoted on the American Stock<br /><br />
Exchange (the "AMEX") under the symbol "XCL" and on the<br /><br />
London Stock Exchange. On September 30, 1998, the last<br /><br />
reported closing price of the Common Stock on the AMEX was<br /><br />

DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS<br /><br />
This Prospectus includes (or incorporates by reference) "forwardlooking statements." All statements made in this Prospectus, other than<br /><br />
historical facts (whether set forth or incorporated by reference), are<br /><br />
forward-looking<br /><br />

to be correct.<br /><br />
It is difficult to estimate quantities of proved oil and natural<br /><br />
gas reserves and to project future rates of production, the timing of<br /><br />
development costs and future net revenues. Those estimates depend upon<br /><br />
many factors the Company cannot control. Reserve engineering involves<br /><br />
estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot<br /><br />
be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate<br /><br />
depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of that<br /><br />
data and the judgment of the reserve engineers. As a result, estimates<br /><br />
made by different engineers are often different. Because reserve<br /><br />
estimates are only estimates, the actual amounts of oil and natural gas<br /><br />
recovered are usually different from the estimates. Results of drilling,<br /><br />
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may require<br /><br />
reserve estimates to be revised and may change the schedule of<br /><br />
production and development drilling.<br /><br />
Additional important factors that could cause actual results to<br /><br />
differ materially from the Company's expectations are disclosed under<br /><br />
"Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Prospectus.<br /><br />

The Company<br /><br />
----------XCL<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
principally engaged in the exploration<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
development of oil and gas in the Zhao Dong Block (the "Zhao Dong<br /><br />
Block") located in the shallow waters of the Bohai Bay in the<br /><br />
People's<br /><br />
Republic of China ("China").<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
obtained<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
second production sharing contract covering the Zhang Dong Block<br /><br />
(the "Zhang Dong Block"),<br /><br />
also in the shallow waters of Bohai<br /><br />
Bay,<br /><br />
effective October 1, 1998.<br /><br />
To date the Company has<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
generated any profits from these operations.<br /><br />
The Company's only<br /><br />
historic revenues were derived from its financing activities and<br /><br />
properties<br /><br />
currently held for sale or investment or<br /><br />
previously<br /><br />
sold.<br /><br />

The Company is<br /><br />

The Zhao Dong Block is located in one of China's major oilproducing basins. Geologic information suggests that a portion of<br /><br />
the Zhao Dong Block is an extension of the onshore Dagang oil<br /><br />
field<br /><br />
complex<br /><br />
to the west.<br /><br />
Approximately 700 million<br /><br />
barrels<br /><br />
have already been produced from that field and it is still under<br /><br />
production.<br /><br />
The Zhao Dong Block is also about 40 miles northwest<br /><br />
of the Shengli oil field, the largest in the basin, from which<br /><br />
about 4 billion barrels have already been produced.<br /><br />
The Shengli<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
field<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
still<br /><br />
under production as<br /><br />
well.<br /><br />
Of<br /><br />
course,<br /><br />
production in those fields does not ensure that there will<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
production from the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
In early 1993, XCL became the first foreign company to enter<br /><br />
into<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
onshore Production Sharing Agreement (the<br /><br />
"Contract"),<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
China<br /><br />
National<br /><br />
Oil and Gas Exploration<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Development<br /><br />
Corporation ("CNODC") (which is a Chinese state enterprise).<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Contract provides for exploration, development, and production of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block. CNODC is the arm of the China National<br /><br />
Petroleum Company ("CNPC"), also a state enterprise, in charge of<br /><br />
all onshore exploration and production activity in China out to<br /><br />
five meters in water depth. CNODC operates in this area through<br /><br />
its subsidiary, Dagang Oilfield (Group) Co. Ltd. ("Dagang").<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contract provides that the "Foreign Contractor"<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Apache Corporation ("Apache") as a group,<br /><br />
working<br /><br />
through<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
participation agreement) is to pay<br /><br />
all<br /><br />
exploration<br /><br />
costs. The Contract also states that, when a commercial discovery<br /><br />
is made, CNODC may choose to participate in development, with up<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
51%<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
all development and operating costs and<br /><br />
allocable<br /><br />
remainder<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
and gas production allocated to CNODC<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
remaining<br /><br />
interest<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor's<br /><br />
share is divided equally between XCL<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Apache.<br /><br />
See "Business -- The Contract" and "Business -- Apache Farmout."<br /><br />
XCL and Apache have successfully tested six of ten wells<br /><br />
drilled to date on the Zhao Dong Block, with total test rates<br /><br />
exceeding 39,500 barrels of oil per day.<br /><br />
Of the four wells not<br /><br />
tested, one (the D-3) was proven productive by wire line samples<br /><br />
and tests in several sands but was not drill-stem tested, while a<br /><br />
second (the F-1) was drilled but not fully evaluated.<br /><br />
Drilling<br /><br />
activities on the F-1 have been abandoned. Development of the CD Field for production is now proceeding.<br /><br />
Based on the report of H.J. Gruy and Associates ("Gruy"),<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
independent<br /><br />
petroleum<br /><br />
engineers,<br /><br />
net<br /><br />
proved<br /><br />
reserves<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the C-D Field are estimated to be 11.76<br /><br />
million<br /><br />
barrels as of January 1, 1998, and the estimated present value of<br /><br />
future pre-tax net cash flows is $64.8 million.<br /><br />
The standardized<br /><br />
measure<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
discounted<br /><br />
future net<br /><br />
cash<br /><br />
flows<br /><br />
determined<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
accordance with the rules prescribed by FASB No. 69<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
$53.8<br /><br />
million.<br /><br />
Future reserve values are based on year end prices and<br /><br />
operating costs, production and future development costs based on<br /><br />
current costs with no escalation. See "Business -- Oil and Gas<br /><br />
Reserves" and "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" in the Notes<br /><br />
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.<br /><br />
The Company's Development Program<br /><br />
--------------------------------The C-D Field was discovered by the drilling of the C-1 and<br /><br />
D-1 Wells. The Field has been appraised by the C-2, C-2-2, C-2-2<br /><br />
sidetrack,<br /><br />
C-3,<br /><br />
D-2, and D-3 Wells.<br /><br />
On<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
basis<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
calculated<br /><br />
reserves, Apache and XCL have<br /><br />
prepared<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
Overall<br /><br />
Development<br /><br />
Plan<br /><br />
("ODP")<br /><br />
for the Field.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
ODP<br /><br />
presently<br /><br />
projects the drilling of 45 wells, of which 32 are producers, 8<br /><br />
are water injection wells for the purpose of reservoir pressure<br /><br />
maintenance<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
achieve higher levels of recovery<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
ultimate<br /><br />
reserves<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
5 are water disposal wells.<br /><br />
The ODP<br /><br />
has<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
approved<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Joint<br /><br />
Management<br /><br />
Committee<br /><br />
("JMC"),<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
oversees operations on the Zhao Dong Block, and has been approved<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by CNPC subject to certain modifications that XCL and Apache are<br /><br />
studying.<br /><br />
CNODC has given notice that it will participate as to<br /><br />
its full 51% share in the C-D Field.<br /><br />
XCL,<br /><br />
Apache<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
CNODC<br /><br />
are currently<br /><br />
collaborating<br /><br />
on<br /><br />
engineering<br /><br />
studies to refine the ODP, both to reduce<br /><br />
capital<br /><br />
commitments<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
development and to accelerate<br /><br />
production,<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
have, as a result, suggested some revisions to the original ODP.<br /><br />
It<br /><br />
is expected that these studies will assist the parties<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
determining the<br /><br />
most efficient method for development, including<br /><br />
the practicability of beginning production before all development<br /><br />
operations have been completed. The Company has been informed by<br /><br />
CNODC<br /><br />
that they desire that production on the Zhao Dong Block<br /><br />
begin as soon as practicable and the parties are assessing how<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
would<br /><br />
be commercially feasible.<br /><br />
Initial results<br /><br />
indicate<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
1999<br /><br />
production is possible and the Company, Apache<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
CNODC have decided to attempt to commence initial production in<br /><br />
1999.<br /><br />
XCL's current estimate (which is subject to revision as the<br /><br />
project moves forward) of the costs to develop the reserves in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
C-D Field that are identified in the ODP by Apache<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
"Operator") (which XCL understands are higher than the<br /><br />
reserves<br /><br />
identified<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
XCL's petroleum engineers) is approximately<br /><br />
$185<br /><br />
million<br /><br />
(of<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
XCL's share would<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
approximately<br /><br />
$45.3<br /><br />
million).<br /><br />
This is less than amounts projected by the Operator in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
original<br /><br />
ODP<br /><br />
for several reasons.<br /><br />
Cost<br /><br />
reductions<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
expected in part based on design changes that would eliminate one<br /><br />
drilling<br /><br />
platform<br /><br />
and one production platform<br /><br />
from<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
ODP.<br /><br />
While formal Chinese approval for these changes has not yet been<br /><br />
obtained, all parties believe that such approval can be secured.<br /><br />
Further, cost reductions are expected as a result of preliminary<br /><br />
bids that suggest that cost estimates in the ODP have been too<br /><br />
high.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
addition,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
initial<br /><br />
ODP<br /><br />
included<br /><br />
estimates<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
contingencies<br /><br />
larger than the industry standard.<br /><br />
Finally,<br /><br />
cost<br /><br />
reductions from the Operator's projections are also based on the<br /><br />
assumption that if the project moves forward with dispatch, the<br /><br />
current<br /><br />
weakness of certain Asian currencies<br /><br />
could<br /><br />
result<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
substantial reductions in the costs of steel and fabrication for<br /><br />
the project.<br /><br />
The revised ODP design anticipates that once production and<br /><br />
loading facilities have been installed in the field, wells will<br /><br />
be placed on production as they are drilled.<br /><br />
In this case, cash<br /><br />
flow<br /><br />
from this production would be available to fund part<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
XCL's capital requirements for the development of the C-D Field.<br /><br />
The Company's financial plans include the use of such cash flow<br /><br />
as part of the Company's source of funds.<br /><br />
Production tests of the C-4 Well, announced by XCL on<br /><br />
October 7, 1997, indicate a combined daily rate from 8 zones of<br /><br />
15,359 barrels per day, and 6,107 Mcf of gas, plus a ninth zone<br /><br />
daily rate of 4,600 Mcf and 14 barrels of condensate. This well<br /><br />
suggests a new field discovery on the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
In August<br /><br />
1998,<br /><br />
CNODC,<br /><br />
XCL,<br /><br />
and Apache commenced drilling<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
well<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
appraise the C-4 Well.<br /><br />
If this drilling proves successful, early<br /><br />
production from the two initial wells in the C-4 Well area may<br /><br />
begin by mid-1999; initial feasibility studies indicate that this<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
possible.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
capital<br /><br />
costs attributable<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
early<br /><br />
production are not included in the 1998 work program and budget.<br /><br />
Successful appraisal of the C-4 Well could also cause XCL<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Apache to move promptly toward development of this area.<br /><br />
The Company's Additional Ventures<br /><br />
--------------------------------The<br /><br />
Company is also proceeding with certain other energy<br /><br />
related ventures in China, including a joint venture with<br /><br />
CNPC<br /><br />
United<br /><br />
Lube<br /><br />
Oil<br /><br />
Corporation to engage in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
manufacturing,<br /><br />
distribution<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
marketing of lubricating<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
China<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Southeast Asian markets and a cooperative venture with the China<br /><br />
National<br /><br />
Administration of Coal Geology to explore and<br /><br />
develop<br /><br />
coalbed<br /><br />
methane<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
two areas of China.<br /><br />
See<br /><br />
"Organizational<br /><br />
Chart" below and "Business -- United/XCL Lube Oil Joint Venture"<br /><br />
and<br /><br />

Further, in August 1998 the<br /><br />
Company,<br /><br />
through<br /><br />
its wholly owned subsidiary<br /><br />
XCL-Cathay<br /><br />
Ltd.,<br /><br />
signed a production sharing contract with CNODC for the 12,000acre<br /><br />

on<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company's investments in China.<br /><br />
First Onshore Production Sharing Agreement Between CNODC and a<br /><br />
Foreign Company<br /><br />
- --------------------------------------------------------------In early 1993 the Company became the first foreign company<br /><br />
to enter into an onshore production agreement with CNODC<br /><br />
(although since that time a number of other foreign companies<br /><br />
have also done so). Because XCL was the first foreign company<br /><br />
to enter into such a contract, there was some uncertainty as to<br /><br />
how it would be administered.<br /><br />
Currency/Exchange Rate Fluctuations<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------For the foreseeable future the Company's only material<br /><br />
revenues will be from its oil and gas activities.<br /><br />
These<br /><br />
revenues will be in U.S. dollars. To the extent that at some<br /><br />
future time revenues are paid to the Company in Chinese Renminbi<br /><br />
rather than in dollars, the Company's earnings, operations and<br /><br />
cash flows would then be subject to currency and exchange rate<br /><br />
fluctuations and to restrictions imposed by<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Chinese<br /><br />
government on the transfer and exchange of funds.<br /><br />
If that<br /><br />
occurs the Company will evaluate the currency requirements of<br /><br />
each venture and, if possible, enter into forward exchange<br /><br />
contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions. There can be<br /><br />
no assurance, however, that such forward exchange contracts will<br /><br />
be available at the time of any such occurrence.<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
does not intend to engage in currency speculation.<br /><br />
Renminbi<br /><br />
earnings, if any, must be converted to pay dividends or to make<br /><br />
other payments to the Company in U.S. dollars or other freely<br /><br />
convertible currencies. As of December 1, 1996, as to foreign<br /><br />
investment enterprises, the Renminbi became fully convertible<br /><br />
for current account items, including profit distributions,<br /><br />
interest payments and receipts and expenditures from trade.<br /><br />
Conversion into U.S. dollars is based on the rate set by The<br /><br />
People's Bank of China (which is based on the previous day's PRC<br /><br />
interbank foreign exchange market rate and with reference to<br /><br />
currency exchange rates on the world financial markets). Certain<br /><br />
ministerial approvals are needed to acquire foreign exchange for<br /><br />
a current account transaction. Strict foreign exchange controls<br /><br />
continue for capital account transactions (including repayment<br /><br />
of loan principal and return of direct capital investments and<br /><br />
transactions in investments in negotiable securities).<br /><br />
In the<br /><br />
past, there have been shortages of U.S. dollars or other foreign<br /><br />
currency available for conversion of Renminbi, and it is<br /><br />
possible such shortages could recur, or that restrictions on<br /><br />
conversion could be reimposed in the future at times when the<br /><br />
Company is seeking to convert Renminbi. Prior to 1994, the<br /><br />
Renminbi experienced a significant net devaluation against most<br /><br />
major<br /><br />
currencies, and during certain periods, significant<br /><br />
volatility in the market-based exchange rate.<br /><br />
Since<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
beginning of 1994, the Renminbi to U.S. dollar exchange rate has<br /><br />
largely stabilized. However, there can be no assurance that the<br /><br />
Chinese government will not devalue the Renminbi, that such<br /><br />
exchange rate will otherwise remain stable (particularly in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
light of the recent currency crisis experienced by a number of<br /><br />
other Asian countries), that the Company will continue to be<br /><br />
able to remit foreign currency abroad or that the Company will<br /><br />
be able to convert sufficient amounts of Renminbi in China's<br /><br />
foreign exchange markets to meet its future needs. Additionally,<br /><br />
there<br /><br />
can<br /><br />
be no assurance that approvals for<br /><br />
exchange<br /><br />
transactions will be available in the future or, if available,<br /><br />
will be granted to the Company. The Chinese government has<br /><br />
issued certain international loan procedures (the "Procedures")<br /><br />
that apply to foreign invested enterprises, including Chineseforeign equity and cooperative joint ventures. The Procedures<br /><br />
may require the approval of China's State Administration of<br /><br />
Exchange ("SAFE") for certain international loans to foreign<br /><br />
invested enterprises extended in connection with project finance<br /><br />
transactions, as well as the terms of such transactions.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company plans to obtain funds for certain development projects<br /><br />
through project finance transactions. There can be no assurance<br /><br />
that SAFE approval for such transactions, if necessary, can be<br /><br />
obtained at all or on terms advantageous to the Company.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
failure of the Company to obtain SAFE approval for such<br /><br />
transactions, if required, could adversely affect the Company's<br /><br />
ability to fund its operations.<br /><br />
History of Losses<br /><br />
- ----------------The Company has experienced recurring losses. For the years<br /><br />
ended December 31, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the Company<br /><br />
recorded net losses of approximately $15.2 million,<br /><br />
$36.6<br /><br />
million,<br /><br />
$87.8<br /><br />
million, $12.1 million and<br /><br />
$14<br /><br />
million,<br /><br />
respectively. See "Selected Consolidated Financial Data." There<br /><br />
can be no assurance that the Company will be profitable in the<br /><br />
future.<br /><br />

statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31,<br /><br />
1997 and 1996, the<br /><br />
report of the Company's<br /><br />
independent<br /><br />
1998 accountants<br /><br />
contained<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
explanatory<br /><br />
paragraph<br /><br />
indicating factors which create substantial doubt about the<br /><br />
Company's and XCL-China's ability to continue as a going concern.<br /><br />
Such factors include the Company's ability to generate additional<br /><br />
cash flows to satisfy its development and exploratory<br /><br />
obligations with respect to its China properties.<br /><br />
Volatility<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Oil and Gas Prices; Impact<br /><br />
on<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
Profitability<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------------------------------------The Company's revenue, profitability and future rate of<br /><br />
growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for<br /><br />
crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices can<br /><br />
be extremely volatile and in prior years have been depressed by<br /><br />
excess total supplies. Prices are also affected by actions of<br /><br />
the United States and foreign governments and international<br /><br />
cartels.<br /><br />
Further, prices are often seasonal. There can be no<br /><br />
assurance that current levels for crude oil and natural gas<br /><br />
prices can be sustained. Any substantial or extended decline in<br /><br />
such prices would have a material adverse effect on the Company's<br /><br />
financial condition and results of operations, including reduced<br /><br />
cash flow and borrowing capacity.<br /><br />
Operating Hazards; Uninsured Risks<br /><br />
- ---------------------------------The nature of the crude oil and natural gas business<br /><br />
involves many operating hazards such as crude oil and natural gas<br /><br />
blowouts, explosions, encountering formations with<br /><br />
abnormal<br /><br />
pressures, cratering and crude oil spills and fires,<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
inclement weather. Any of these could result in damage to or<br /><br />
destruction of crude oil and natural gas wells, destruction of<br /><br />
producing facilities, damage to life or property, suspension of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
operations, environmental damage and possible liability to the<br /><br />
Company.<br /><br />
In accordance with customary industry practices, the<br /><br />
Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of such<br /><br />
risks and losses. The Company does not maintain any insurance<br /><br />
against the risks of expropriation and nationalization of its<br /><br />
business interests in China. The occurrence of such an event not<br /><br />
fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect<br /><br />
on the financial condition and results of operations of the<br /><br />
Company.<br /><br />
Competition<br /><br />
- ----------The oil and gas industry is marked by strong competition<br /><br />
from major oil companies and independent operators in acquiring<br /><br />
properties and leases for the exploration for, and production of,<br /><br />
crude oil and natural gas. Competition is particularly intense<br /><br />
with respect to the acquisition of desirable undeveloped crude<br /><br />
oil and natural gas properties. The Company anticipates such<br /><br />
competition in connection with any expansion of its activities in<br /><br />
China.<br /><br />
The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of<br /><br />
such undeveloped crude oil and natural gas properties include the<br /><br />
staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and acquire<br /><br />
interests in such properties, close working relationships with<br /><br />
governmental authorities who control acquisition, exploration,<br /><br />
production and marketing activities in China, and the financial<br /><br />
resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties. Many<br /><br />
of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial<br /><br />
resources, staff and facilities.<br /><br />
The principal raw materials and resources necessary for the<br /><br />
exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas are<br /><br />
interests in prospective properties, drilling rigs and related<br /><br />
equipment<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
explore for such reserves and knowledgeable<br /><br />
personnel to conduct all phases of crude oil and natural gas<br /><br />
operations. The Company must compete for such raw materials and<br /><br />
resources with both major integrated energy companies<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
independent operators. Although the Company believes that its<br /><br />
current operating and financial resources are adequate<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
preclude any significant disruption of its operations in the<br /><br />
immediate future, the continued availability of such materials<br /><br />
and resources to the Company cannot be assured.<br /><br />
Depletion of Reserves<br /><br />
- --------------------The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas<br /><br />
properties declines as reserves are depleted.<br /><br />
Except to the<br /><br />
extent the Company acquires additional properties containing<br /><br />
proved reserves, conducts successful exploration and development<br /><br />
activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional<br /><br />
behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved<br /><br />
reserves of the Company will decline as reserves are produced.<br /><br />
Future crude oil and natural gas production is therefore highly<br /><br />
dependent upon the Company's level of success in acquiring or<br /><br />
finding additional reserves.<br /><br />
Government Regulation<br /><br />
- --------------------The Company's business is subject to certain Chinese and<br /><br />
United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations<br /><br />
relating to the exploration for and development, production and<br /><br />
marketing of crude oil and natural gas, as well as environmental<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
safety<br /><br />
matters.<br /><br />
In addition, the Chinese government<br /><br />
regulates various aspects of foreign company operations in China.<br /><br />
Such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in<br /><br />
recent years in the United States, often imposing greater<br /><br />
liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties.<br /><br />
It is not unreasonable to expect that the same trend will be<br /><br />
encountered in China. Because the requirements imposed by such<br /><br />
laws and regulations are frequently changed, the Company is<br /><br />
unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. There is no<br /><br />
assurance that laws and regulations enacted in the future will<br /><br />
not adversely affect the Company's financial condition and<br /><br />
results of operations.<br /><br />
Dependence on Key Personnel<br /><br />
- ---------------------------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company depends to a large extent on Marsden W. Miller,<br /><br />
Jr., its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, for<br /><br />
its management and business and financial contacts in China and<br /><br />
its relationship with Chinese authorities. The Company does not<br /><br />
have an employment contract with Mr. Miller or with any other<br /><br />
officer or employee, other than employment agreements or similar<br /><br />
arrangements with certain operational employees of the Company's<br /><br />
subsidiaries. See "Management." The unavailability of Mr. Miller<br /><br />
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.<br /><br />
The Company's success is also dependent upon its ability to<br /><br />
retain skilled technical personnel. While the Company has not to<br /><br />
date experienced difficulties in employing or retaining such<br /><br />
personnel, its failure to do so in the future could adversely<br /><br />
affect its business. The Company does not maintain key man life<br /><br />
insurance on any of its executives or other personnel.<br /><br />
Limitations on the Availability of the Company's Net Operating<br /><br />
Loss Carryforwards<br /><br />
- ---------------------------------------------------------------The Company has incurred net operating loss ("NOL")<br /><br />
carryforwards as at December 31, 1997 of $183 million.<br /><br />
Use of<br /><br />
the NOLs by the Company are subject to limitations under Section<br /><br />
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to ownership<br /><br />
changes. The various stock offerings made by the Company may have<br /><br />
triggered those limits. Also uncertainties as to the future use<br /><br />
of the NOLs exist under the criteria set forth in Financial<br /><br />
Accounting<br /><br />
Standards<br /><br />
Board ("FASB")<br /><br />
Statement<br /><br />
No.<br /><br />
109,<br /><br />
"Accounting for Income Taxes."<br /><br />
The Company established<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
valuation allowance of $81.1 million and $83.6 million for<br /><br />
deferred tax assets at December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.<br /><br />
Lack of Public Market<br /><br />
- --------------------There is no current public market for the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock other than the limited trading through the<br /><br />
Private Offering, Resales and Trading through Automated Linkage<br /><br />
("PORTAL") Market of the National Association of Securities<br /><br />
Dealers, Inc. and none is expected to develop.<br /><br />
Possible Volatility of Price of the Common Stock<br /><br />
- -----------------------------------------------The market price of the Common Stock and Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response<br /><br />
to quarterly variations in the Company's results of operations,<br /><br />
changes in earnings estimates by analysts, conditions in the oil<br /><br />
and gas industry or general market or economic conditions.<br /><br />
No Cash Dividends<br /><br />
- ----------------The Company has not paid any cash dividends to date on the<br /><br />
Common Stock and there are no plans for cash dividend payments on<br /><br />
its Preferred Stock or Common Stock in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />
The Indenture also limits cash dividends on the Company's equity<br /><br />
securities. Dividends on the Company's Preferred Stock have been<br /><br />
paid in kind.<br /><br />
In the event of dividend defaults on the<br /><br />
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, under the terms of such<br /><br />
Stock the Company would be restricted from paying cash dividends<br /><br />
on the Common Stock for so long as such dividend defaults<br /><br />
continued. See "Price Range of Common Stock," "Dividend Policy,"<br /><br />
"Description of Existing Debt" and "Description of Capital Stock<br /><br />
- -- Preferred Stock."<br /><br />
Possible Delisting of Common Stock<br /><br />
- ---------------------------------The AMEX has, since November 1996, continued to review the<br /><br />
Company's listing eligibility since the Company has not met<br /><br />
certain financial requirements for continued listing. The Company<br /><br />
intends to try to satisfy the Exchange's concerns. In the event<br /><br />
the Common Stock is delisted from the AMEX, the liquidity of the<br /><br />
Securities and the Company's ability to continue funding its<br /><br />
activities through the sale of securities may be significantly<br /><br />
<br /><br />
impaired.<br /><br />
Certain Anti-takeover Provisions<br /><br />
- -------------------------------A Change of Control or other Fundamental Change gives<br /><br />
holders of Amended Series A Preferred Stock special conversion<br /><br />
rights for 45 days. These rights are intended to provide those<br /><br />
holders with limited loss protection in certain circumstances.<br /><br />
The rights may also render more costly or otherwise discourage<br /><br />
certain<br /><br />
takeovers<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
other<br /><br />
business<br /><br />
combinations.<br /><br />
See<br /><br />
"Description of Capital Stock -- Preferred Stock -- Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock -- Special Conversion Rights."<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
Amended and Restated Certificate<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Incorporation contains provisions that the Board of Directors<br /><br />
believes may impede or discourage a takeover of the Company<br /><br />
without the support of the incumbent Board. See "Description of<br /><br />
Capital Stock -- Common Stock -- Special Charter and By-Law<br /><br />
Provisions."<br /><br />
Year 2000 Compliance<br /><br />
- -------------------The Company has conducted a review of its computer systems<br /><br />
to identify the systems that could be affected by the "Year 2000"<br /><br />
issue and has upgraded certain of its software to software that<br /><br />
purports to be Year 2000 compliant. The Year 2000 problem is the<br /><br />
result of computer programs being written using two digits<br /><br />
(rather than four) to define the applicable year and equipment<br /><br />
with time-sensitive embedded components. Any of the Company's<br /><br />
programs that have time-sensitive software or equipment that has<br /><br />
time-sensitive embedded components may recognize a date using<br /><br />
"00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.<br /><br />
This could<br /><br />
result in a major system failure or miscalculations. Although no<br /><br />
assurance can be given because of the potential wide scale<br /><br />
manifestations of this problem which may affect the Company's<br /><br />
business, the Company presently believes that the Year 2000<br /><br />
problem will not pose significant operational problems for its<br /><br />
computer systems. The Company is not able to estimate the total<br /><br />
costs of undertaking Year 2000 remedial activities, if they will<br /><br />
be required. However, based upon information developed to date,<br /><br />
it believes that the total cost of Year 2000 remediation will not<br /><br />
be material to the Company's cash flow, results of operation or<br /><br />
financial condition. The Company also may be vulnerable to other<br /><br />
companies' Year 2000 issues. The Company's current estimates of<br /><br />
the impact of the Year 2000 problem on its operations and<br /><br />
financial results do not include costs that may be incurred as a<br /><br />
result of any vendors' or customers' failure to become Year 2000<br /><br />
compliant on a timely basis. The Company intends to initiate<br /><br />
formal communications with all of its significant vendors and<br /><br />
customers with respect to such persons' Year 2000 compliance<br /><br />
programs and status in the fourth quarter of 1998. The Company<br /><br />
expects to complete its Year 2000 review and, if required,<br /><br />
remediation efforts within a time frame that will enable its<br /><br />
computer-based and embedded chip systems to function without<br /><br />
significant disruption in the Year 2000. However, there can be<br /><br />
no assurance that such other companies will achieve Year 2000<br /><br />
compliance or that any conversions by such companies to become<br /><br />
Year 2000 compliant will be compatible with the Company's<br /><br />
computer system. The inability of the Company or any of its<br /><br />
principal vendors or customers to become Year 2000 compliant in a<br /><br />
timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the<br /><br />
Company's financial condition or results of operations.<br /><br />
FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING<br /><br />
The Company has recently taken steps to simplify its capital<br /><br />
structure. Effective November 10, 1997, the Company recapitalized<br /><br />
and combined the Series A and E Preferred Stock into an aggregate<br /><br />
of 790,613 shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock (including<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid dividends paid in kind). As of September 30,<br /><br />
1998 there were 1,181,614 shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock issued and outstanding with an aggregate liquidation<br /><br />
preference of approximately $100 million. Effective January 16,<br /><br />
1998, the Series F Preferred Stock was mandatorily converted into<br /><br />
an aggregate of 633,893 shares of Common Stock. On March 3, 1998,<br /><br />
the Company settled litigation instituted by the holder of its<br /><br />
Series B, Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Stock").<br /><br />
The holder revoked and withdrew its redemption notice<br /><br />
and sold its shares of Series B Preferred Stock and accompanying<br /><br />
warrants. The purchasers exchanged the stock and warrants for<br /><br />
44,465<br /><br />
shares of Amended Series B, Cumulative Convertible<br /><br />
Preferred Stock ("Amended Series B Preferred Stock") and warrants<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock,<br /><br />
subject<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
adjustment, and received 2,620 shares of Amended Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock in payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on<br /><br />
the Series B Preferred Stock. See "Business -- Litigation."<br /><br />
As<br /><br />
of September 30, 1998, there were 48,405 shares of Amended Series<br /><br />
B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding with an aggregate<br /><br />
liquidation preference of approximately $4.8 million.<br /><br />
For a<br /><br />
description of the material terms of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and the Amended Series B Preferred Stock, see<br /><br />
"Description of Capital Stock -- Preferred Stock -- Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock" and "--Amended Series B Preferred<br /><br />
Stock."<br /><br />
USE OF PROCEEDS<br /><br />
Each Selling Security Holder will receive all of the net<br /><br />
proceeds from the sale of the Securities owned by such Selling<br /><br />
Security Holder. The Company will not receive any proceeds from<br /><br />
the sale of any Securities, although the Company will receive the<br /><br />
proceeds from any exercise of the Warrants. However, there can<br /><br />
be no assurance that the Warrants will be exercised.<br /><br />
Assuming<br /><br />
all of the Warrants are exercised, the net proceeds to the<br /><br />
Company would be approximately $63 million. The proceeds from<br /><br />
such Warrant exercises, if any, will be used by the Company to<br /><br />
fund its China projects and for general working capital purposes.<br /><br />

DIVIDEND POLICY<br /><br />
XCL has not paid any cash dividends on the Common Stock to<br /><br />
date and has no plans for Common Stock cash dividend payments in<br /><br />
the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends will<br /><br />
depend on the Company's future earnings and financial condition.<br /><br />
The Company is restricted from paying cash dividends on its<br /><br />
equity securities under the terms of the Indenture. Dividends on<br /><br />
the Company's Preferred Stock have been paid in kind.<br /><br />
In the<br /><br />
event of dividend defaults on the outstanding shares of Preferred<br /><br />
Stock, under the terms of such Stock the Company would be<br /><br />
restricted from paying cash dividends on the Common Stock for so<br /><br />
long as such dividend defaults continued. See "Risk Factors -No Cash Dividends," "Description of the Existing Debt" and<br /><br />

respect to the Company's estimated proved undeveloped<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
reserves and the estimated future net cash flows attributable<br /><br />
thereto.<br /><br />
Unless otherwise noted, all information in<br /><br />
this<br /><br />
Prospectus relating to oil reserves and the estimated future net<br /><br />
cash flows attributable thereto are based on estimates prepared<br /><br />
by the Company's independent petroleum engineers and are shown<br /><br />
net to the Company's interest. The estimated future undiscounted<br /><br />
net cash flows and the present value of estimated future net cash<br /><br />
flows were prepared using constant prices as of the calculation<br /><br />
dates. The present value of estimated future net cash flows were<br /><br />
discounted at 10% per annum on a pre-tax basis. The following<br /><br />
table also sets forth, for comparison purposes, the standardized<br /><br />
measure of discounted future net cash flows determined in<br /><br />
accordance with the rules prescribed by FASB No. 69.See "Risk<br /><br />

Background<br /><br />
---------The Company's management decided in the fourth quarter of<br /><br />
1995 to focus on the Company's operations in China and to sell<br /><br />
its other assets. The excellent well test results on the Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block and the Company's reserve assessments support this<br /><br />
decision. The Company has focused on (i) raising funds to meet<br /><br />
capital requirements for Chinese operations, (ii) selling its<br /><br />
other properties and (iii) simplifying its capital structure to<br /><br />
make it easier to raise capital. The Company intends to continue<br /><br />
these activities and to work with Apache and CNODC to refine the<br /><br />
ODP<br /><br />
to reduce expenditures and accelerate production. The<br /><br />
Company's only historic revenues have been from the Company's<br /><br />
financing activities and from properties previously sold and<br /><br />
those currently held for sale or investment. The Company is in<br /><br />
the development stage with respect to its operations in China and<br /><br />
has not generated any revenues from operations related to its<br /><br />
properties and interests in China.<br /><br />
The Company has made significant capital expenditures since<br /><br />
acquiring its interest in the Zhao Dong Block in 1992.<br /><br />
Despite<br /><br />
incurring losses since 1992, the Company, because of the high<br /><br />
quality of the Zhao Dong Block, has been able to obtain all<br /><br />
required funds for the exploration and development of the Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On August 20, 1998, the Company entered into a production<br /><br />
sharing contract with CNODC for the 12,000-acre Zhang Dong Block<br /><br />
and on September 15, 1998, the contract was approved by the<br /><br />
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of China,<br /><br />
effective October 1, 1998.<br /><br />
Liquidity and Capital Resources<br /><br />
------------------------------The Company offered and sold $75 million of Notes and $25<br /><br />
million of equity on May 20, 1997. During 1997 such funds were<br /><br />
used to pay costs of the offering, the Company's 1997 exploration<br /><br />
and development costs and $38 million of debt. At June 30, 1998,<br /><br />
the Company had an unrestricted operating cash balance of $11.4<br /><br />
million and restricted cash held in escrow for the payment of<br /><br />
interest on the Notes of $5.2 million. The Company had net<br /><br />
working capital of $6.0 million. These cash balances are not<br /><br />
sufficient to cover the Company's working capital requirements<br /><br />
and capital expenditure obligations on the Zhao Dong Block during<br /><br />
the remainder of 1998 and through 1999.<br /><br />
As a result of the Company's decision to focus on China and<br /><br />
sell its U.S. assets, the Company presently has no source of<br /><br />
material revenues. Revenues for 1997 were $0.2 million versus<br /><br />
$1.1 million in 1996. The Company incurred a loss for fiscal<br /><br />
1997 of $14.0 million and expects to incur a loss in 1998 as well<br /><br />
because production and related cash flow from the Zhao Dong and<br /><br />
Zhang Dong Blocks are not expected until 1999.<br /><br />
For the six<br /><br />
months ended June 30, 1998, the Company had a net loss of $4.1<br /><br />
million.<br /><br />
Management's Plan<br /><br />
----------------The Company's unrestricted cash will be required for working<br /><br />
capital and exploration, development and production expenditures<br /><br />
on the Zhao Dong and Zhang Dong Blocks.<br /><br />
With respect to the Zhao Dong Block, CNODC has given written<br /><br />
notice that it will participate as to its full 51% share of the CD Field and has urged that production begin as soon as reasonably<br /><br />
practicable.<br /><br />
Except for certain exploratory wells on which<br /><br />
Apache has an obligation to pay for the Company's costs, the<br /><br />
Company is required to fund 50% of all exploration expenditures<br /><br />
and 24.5% of all development and production expenditures.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
estimates<br /><br />
that its share of<br /><br />
actual<br /><br />
development<br /><br />
expenditures for the C-D Field for the remainder of 1998 will be<br /><br />
<br /><br />
approximately $2.0 million. The Company estimates that its share<br /><br />
of unpaid exploration expenses for the remainder of 1998 will be<br /><br />
approximately $5.0 million. The Company estimates that its share<br /><br />
of development expenses for 1999 will be approximately $22<br /><br />
million. The Company estimates its share of exploration expenses<br /><br />
of the remaining two obligatory wells to be drilled in 1999 is<br /><br />
approximately $6.0 million. The Company anticipates that in<br /><br />
addition to the two obligatory exploration wells to be drilled in<br /><br />
1999, additional exploration wells may be drilled during 1999.<br /><br />
The Company presently projects and plans that these funds will be<br /><br />
available from the sale or refinancing of domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
properties held for sale and/or investment in land, project<br /><br />
financing, increasing the amount of senior secured<br /><br />

Based<br /><br />
on<br /><br />
continuing discussions with major<br /><br />

See "Risk Factors."<br /><br />
Due to the successful results of the D-3 and C-4 Wells, the<br /><br />
1998 work program and budget exceed the Company's initial<br /><br />
preliminary projections earlier in 1997. This results from the<br /><br />
necessity of drilling at least one appraisal well offsetting the<br /><br />
C-4 exploratory well and the decision to extend the Contract into<br /><br />
its third exploratory period because of the successful drilling<br /><br />
of the D-3 and C-4 wells. XCL, Apache, and CNODC are working<br /><br />
together to reduce capital costs for the Zhao Dong Block and to<br /><br />
determine whether the commencement of production from the C-4<br /><br />
Well area can be accelerated into the first half of 1999.<br /><br />
This<br /><br />
work has already resulted in reductions of estimated capital<br /><br />
costs of approximately $35 million based on a change in the<br /><br />
conceptual design, and a determination that it is possible to<br /><br />
commence production from the C-4 well area in the first half of<br /><br />
1999. It is the Company's understanding that the Company, Apache<br /><br />
and CNODC have now all agreed to make every effort to achieve<br /><br />
initial production in the first half of 1999. The $28 million<br /><br />
estimated to be necessary for exploration and development in 1999<br /><br />
does not include the entire cost of accelerating production from<br /><br />
the C-4 Well area into the first part of 1999. The Company<br /><br />
estimates<br /><br />
this<br /><br />
would require additional<br /><br />
expenditures<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
approximately $960,000, which the Company believes it can obtain<br /><br />
from the sources described above.<br /><br />
The Company is the operator of the Zhang Dong Block and, as<br /><br />
such, is required to cover the costs of initial appraisal<br /><br />
drilling, upgrading production facilities and additional studies<br /><br />
of seismic data. The contract commits the Company to drill at<br /><br />
least one well during the first year. Under the contract, the<br /><br />
Company is entitled to 49% of the production. The Company<br /><br />
estimates that its minimum capital requirements over the next<br /><br />
year to satisfy the terms of the Zhang Dong contract are<br /><br />
approximately $8 million. Funds are expected to come from the<br /><br />
previously mentioned sources.<br /><br />
Longer term liquidity is dependent upon the Company's future<br /><br />
performance, including commencement of production in China, as<br /><br />
well as continued access to capital markets. In addition, the<br /><br />
Company's efforts to secure additional financing could<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
impaired if its Common Stock is delisted from the AMEX.<br /><br />
If funds for the purposes described above are not available,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company may be required substantially to curtail its<br /><br />
operations or to sell or surrender all or part of its interest in<br /><br />
the Zhao Dong or the Zhang Dong Blocks and/or its other interests<br /><br />
in China in order to meet its obligations and continue as a going<br /><br />
concern.<br /><br />
The Company is not obligated<br /><br />
capital payments to its lubricating<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to make any additional<br /><br />
oil and coalbed methane<br /><br />
<br /><br />
projects.<br /><br />
The Company is in discussions with the Chinese about<br /><br />
expansion of their lube oil venture. If these discussions are<br /><br />
successfully concluded, additional capital investments will be<br /><br />
required by the Company; however, at this time it is not known<br /><br />
what the extent or timing for such investments might be.<br /><br />
Similarly, if the Company's coalbed methane project becomes<br /><br />
active and is successful, the Company may make additional<br /><br />
investments in that business. Again, the extent and timing of<br /><br />
such investment, if any, is unknown at this time.<br /><br />
Other General Considerations<br /><br />
- ---------------------------Pursuant to the Company's December 17, 1997 shareholders'<br /><br />
meeting, whereby several compensation plans were approved, the<br /><br />
Company recorded unearned compensation of approximately $12.8<br /><br />
million.<br /><br />
This amount will be amortized ratably over future<br /><br />
periods of up to five years and is recorded as a non-cash expense<br /><br />
in the Statement of Operations. Because certain of these awards<br /><br />
are based on market capitalization there may be additional<br /><br />
amounts which may become payable. Approximately $0.9 million of<br /><br />
compensation expense was recorded in connection with these awards<br /><br />
during 1997. An additional $0.7 million of compensation expense<br /><br />
was recorded in the first six months of 1998.<br /><br />
The Company believes that inflation has had no material<br /><br />
impact on its sales, revenues or income during the reporting<br /><br />
periods. In light of increased oil and gas exploration activity<br /><br />
worldwide, and in the Bohai Bay in particular, increased rates<br /><br />
for equipment and services, and limited rig availability may have<br /><br />
an impact in the future.<br /><br />
The Company is subject to existing domestic and Chinese<br /><br />
federal,<br /><br />
state<br /><br />
and local laws and regulations<br /><br />
governing<br /><br />
environmental quality and pollution control. Although management<br /><br />
believes that such operations are in general compliance with<br /><br />
applicable environmental regulations, risks of substantial costs<br /><br />
and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas operations, and there<br /><br />
can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will<br /><br />
not be incurred.<br /><br />
New Accounting Pronouncements<br /><br />
- ----------------------------In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting<br /><br />
Comprehensive Income," which is effective for the Company's year<br /><br />
ending December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for<br /><br />
the reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its<br /><br />
components.<br /><br />
The Company will be analyzing SFAS No. 130 during<br /><br />
1998 to determine what, if any, additional disclosures will be<br /><br />
required.<br /><br />
In June 1997, the FASB Issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures<br /><br />
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which<br /><br />
is effective for the Company's year ended December 31, 1998.<br /><br />
This statement establishes standards for reporting of information<br /><br />
about operating segments. The Company will be analyzing SFAS No.<br /><br />
131 during 1998 to determine what, if any, additional disclosures<br /><br />
will be required.<br /><br />
Results of Operations<br /><br />
- --------------------The six month period ended June 30, 1998 compared to the six<br /><br />
month period ended June 30, 1997<br /><br />
- -----------------------------------------------------------------During the six months ended June 30, 1998 and June 30, 1997,<br /><br />
the Company incurred net losses of $4.1 million and $2.4 million,<br /><br />
respectively.<br /><br />
Revenues and operating expenses associated with oil and gas<br /><br />
properties<br /><br />
held<br /><br />
for sale have become<br /><br />
insignificant<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
accordingly, are recorded in other costs and operating expenses<br /><br />
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.<br /><br />
Interest expense increased during the six months ended June<br /><br />
30, 1998, when compared with the same period in 1997, because of<br /><br />
increased debt and interest rates. Also included in interest<br /><br />
expense was amortization of warrant costs and debt issue costs on<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Senior<br /><br />
Secured Notes issued in May 1997.<br /><br />
Interest<br /><br />
capitalized for the comparable periods in 1998 and 1997 increased<br /><br />
because the oil and gas property base was larger, thus, reducing<br /><br />
net interest expense for the periods.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
dividends were $4.9 million for the six<br /><br />
1998, as compared to $3.3 million for the<br /><br />
The increase is the result of the issuance<br /><br />
in the equity offering concluded in May<br /><br />
are paid in additional shares of Preferred<br /><br />
the Company.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and<br /><br />
1997 was $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
increase of $0.2 million in 1998 resulted from the short-term<br /><br />
investment of cash still available from the May 1997 debt and<br /><br />
equity offerings.<br /><br />
General and administrative expenses were $2.9 million for<br /><br />
the six months ended June 30, 1998, as compared to $1.6 million<br /><br />
for the same period in 1997. The increase of $1.3 million during<br /><br />
the six month period ended June 30, 1998, was primarily due to<br /><br />
increases in non-cash compensation charges related to stock and<br /><br />
appreciation options of $0.7 million (approved by shareholders in<br /><br />
December 1997), $0.4 million in legal and professional fees, and<br /><br />
$0.2 million in public company expenses. Legal and professional<br /><br />
fees increased because of additional services and public company<br /><br />
expenses associated with holding two shareholder meetings.<br /><br />
1997 compared to 1996<br /><br />
- --------------------The Company incurred a loss of $14 million in 1997, as<br /><br />
compared with a loss of $12 million in 1996. Included in the<br /><br />
loss<br /><br />
for 1997 is a charge of $0.9 million for non-cash<br /><br />
compensation charges, related to stock and appreciation options,<br /><br />
which are classified in general and administrative expenses.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
addition, 1997 includes a $2.8 million provision for estimated<br /><br />
settlements in connection with various disputes and litigation<br /><br />
matters.<br /><br />
Such amount is reflected in Other in the Statement of<br /><br />
Operations. In addition, $0.6 million of non-cash charges relate<br /><br />
to early extinguishment of debt.<br /><br />
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $6.0<br /><br />
million in 1997 primarily as a result of increased borrowings and<br /><br />
higher interest rates on the new debt. In addition, interest<br /><br />
expense includes amortization of $1.3 million relating to the<br /><br />
value assigned to warrants issued with the $75 million debt<br /><br />
offering completed in May 1997.<br /><br />
The net loss for 1996 includes a $3.85 million noncash<br /><br />
charge for the provision of impairment of domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
properties classified as held for sale. The loss in 1996 also<br /><br />
reflects the effect of a $2.4 million write-down and $0.7 million<br /><br />
loss on sale of the Company's investments.<br /><br />
Oil and gas revenues from properties held for sale for the<br /><br />
year ended December 31, 1997 were approximately $0.2 million,<br /><br />
compared to approximately $1.1 million during 1996. Revenues will<br /><br />
continue to decline as the Company completes its announced program<br /><br />
of selling substantially all of its U.S. producing properties.<br /><br />
Interest income increased $2.2 million during the year ended<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, compared with 1996. The primary reason for<br /><br />
this increase was the interest earned on the $75 million held<br /><br />
in escrow from the Note Offering.<br /><br />
As the Company continues to focus its resources on<br /><br />
exploration and development of the Zhao Dong and Zhang Dong<br /><br />
Blocks, future oil and gas revenues will initially be directly<br /><br />
related to the degree of drilling success experienced.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company does not anticipate significant increases in its oil and<br /><br />
gas production in the short-term and expects to incur operating<br /><br />
losses until such time as net revenues from the China projects<br /><br />
are realized.<br /><br />
General and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million<br /><br />
during 1997 as compared with 1996, as reflected in the following<br /><br />

The increase in legal and professional fees of approximately<br /><br />
$0.8 million were principally related to fees of approximately<br /><br />
$0.2 million on one lawsuit, an increase of approximately $0.3<br /><br />
million for outside consulting and the remainder of the increase<br /><br />
for general and corporate legal and accounting services.<br /><br />
1996 compared to 1995<br /><br />
--------------------The Company reported a net loss for fiscal 1996 of $12.1<br /><br />
million before preferred dividends of $5.4 million, or a total of<br /><br />
$0.98 per share, compared to a net loss for fiscal 1995 of $87.8<br /><br />
million before preferred dividends of $4.8 million, or $5.77 per<br /><br />
share (as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split). The net loss<br /><br />
for 1996 includes a $3.85 million noncash charge for impairment<br /><br />
of domestic oil and gas properties, classified as assets held for<br /><br />
sale.<br /><br />
The loss in 1996 also reflects a $2.4 million write-down<br /><br />
and $0.7 million loss on the sale of the Company's investments.<br /><br />
The net loss for 1995 includes a $75.3 million noncash<br /><br />
charge for the provision of impairment of domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
properties. The carrying amounts of the Company's properties in<br /><br />
Texas were written down by $16.5 million during 1995, in order to<br /><br />
comply with the ceiling limitation prescribed by the Commission.<br /><br />
This was principally due to downward revisions in estimated<br /><br />
reserves in the second quarter and reduced present values of<br /><br />
reserves attributable to delays in development drilling scheduled<br /><br />
in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, to reflect the<br /><br />
expected results of its announced program to divest itself of its<br /><br />
U.S. oil and gas properties, the Company recorded an additional<br /><br />
$58.8 million noncash write-down, reducing the recorded value of<br /><br />
its domestic oil and gas properties to their estimated fair<br /><br />
market value. The loss in 1995 also reflects the effects of a<br /><br />
$4.5 million write-down of the Company's other assets and<br /><br />
investments.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Oil and gas revenues from properties held for sale in 1996<br /><br />
were $1.1 million as compared to $2.5 million in 1995, primarily<br /><br />
due to continued reduction in volume sold. The Company does not<br /><br />
anticipate material revenues until mid-1999 at the earliest when<br /><br />
production in China may commence.<br /><br />
General and administrative expenses for 1996 were $3.5<br /><br />
million as compared to $4.6 million in 1995.<br /><br />
General and<br /><br />
administrative costs are expected to remain relatively unchanged<br /><br />
during the upcoming year. Operating costs are expected to<br /><br />
decline due to the further disposition of domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
properties.<br /><br />
Interest expense decreased in 1996, due primarily<br /><br />
Company's principal payments on its institutional debt<br /><br />
first quarter of 1996.<br /><br />

Subsequent Events<br /><br />
- -----------------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Since June 30, 1998, the Company entered into a production<br /><br />
sharing contract with CNODC for the 12,000-acre Zhang Dong Block.<br /><br />
See "Management's Plans" above. In addition, on August 26, 1998,<br /><br />
the Company, Apache and CNODC began drilling the C-5 exploration<br /><br />
<br /><br />
well on the Zhao Dong Block and on August 26, 1998, they<br /><br />
drilling the C-4-2 appraisal well on the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
began<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In September 1998, the Company exchanged (i) 15,000 Equity<br /><br />
Warrants from the May 20, 1997 Equity Offering, exercisable on or<br /><br />
after May 20, 1998 and before May 20, 2004, and entitling the<br /><br />
holder to purchase 351,015 shares of Common Stock at a price of<br /><br />
$3.09 per share and (ii) 24,015 Warrants issued on May 20, 1997,<br /><br />
in connection with interest payable on the Secured Subordinated<br /><br />
Notes due April 15, 2000, exercisable between May 20, 1998 and<br /><br />
November 1, 2000, at an exercise price of $3.09 per share, held<br /><br />
by an institutional holder, for new Warrants exercisable on or<br /><br />
before September 30, 1998 and entitling the holder to purchase<br /><br />
351,015 shares of restricted Common Stock at a price of $2.50 per<br /><br />
share.<br /><br />
On September 17, 1998, the new Warrants were exercised,<br /><br />
as a result of which the Company received approximately $0.9<br /><br />
million and is to issue 351,015 shares of its restricted Common<br /><br />
Stock in an exempt private placement. The Warrant Exchange<br /><br />
Agreement provides that if at any time on or before March 15,<br /><br />
1999, any other holder of Equity Warrants from the May 20, 1997<br /><br />
Equity Offering is offered an exchange of such Warrants or an<br /><br />
amendment to such Warrants to provide for a more favorable<br /><br />
exercise<br /><br />
provision than offered in the<br /><br />
Warrant<br /><br />
Exchange<br /><br />
Agreement, the party to the Warrant Exchange Agreement shall be<br /><br />
entitled to purchase additional shares of Common Stock at a price<br /><br />
of $0.01 per share in an amount that will make its effective<br /><br />
exercise price under the Warrant Exchange Agreement equivalent to<br /><br />
that provided to such other Warrant holder.<br /><br />
Year 2000 Compliance<br /><br />
- -------------------The Company has conducted a review of its computer systems<br /><br />
to identify the systems that could be affected by the "Year 2000"<br /><br />
issue and has upgraded certain of its software to software that<br /><br />
purports to be Year 2000 compliant. The Year 2000 problem is the<br /><br />
result of computer programs being written using two digits<br /><br />
(rather than four) to define the applicable year and equipment<br /><br />
with time-sensitive embedded components. Any of the Company's<br /><br />
programs that have time-sensitive software or equipment that has<br /><br />
time-sensitive embedded components may recognize a date using<br /><br />
"00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.<br /><br />
This could<br /><br />
result in a major system failure or miscalculations. Although no<br /><br />
assurance can be given because of the potential wide scale<br /><br />
manifestations of this problem which may affect the Company's<br /><br />
business, the Company presently believes that the Year 2000<br /><br />
problem will not pose significant operational problems for its<br /><br />
computer systems. The Company is not able to estimate the total<br /><br />
costs of undertaking Year 2000 remedial activities, if they will<br /><br />
be required. However, based upon information developed to date,<br /><br />
it believes that the total cost of Year 2000 remediation will not<br /><br />
be material to the Company's cash flow, results of operations or<br /><br />
financial condition.<br /><br />
The Company also may be vulnerable to other companies' Year<br /><br />
2000 issues. The Company's current estimates of the impact of<br /><br />
the Year 2000 problem on its operations and financial results do<br /><br />
not include costs that may be incurred<br /><br />
as a<br /><br />
result of<br /><br />
any vendors' or customers' failure to become Year 2000 compliant<br /><br />
on a timely basis.<br /><br />
The Company intends to initiate formal<br /><br />
communications with all of its significant vendors and customers<br /><br />
with respect to such persons' Year 2000 compliance programs and<br /><br />
status in the fourth quarter of 1998. The Company expects to<br /><br />
complete its Year 2000 review and, if required, remediation<br /><br />
efforts within a time frame that will enable its computer-based<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
embedded chip systems to function without significant<br /><br />
disruption in the Year 2000. However, there can be no assurance<br /><br />
that such other companies will achieve Year 2000 compliance or<br /><br />
that any conversions by such companies to become Year 2000<br /><br />
compliant will be compatible with the Company's computer system.<br /><br />
The inability of the Company or any of its principal vendors or<br /><br />
customers to become Year 2000 compliant in a timely manner could<br /><br />
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial<br /><br />
condition or results of operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
BUSINESS<br /><br />
The Company's principal business is the exploration for and<br /><br />
development and production of crude oil and natural gas. Building<br /><br />
on the success of its first such project in China, the joint<br /><br />
venture on the Zhao Dong Block (see "Prospectus Summary -- The<br /><br />
Company"), the Company's strategy is to expand those operations<br /><br />
and, selectively, to enter into additional energy-related joint<br /><br />
ventures.<br /><br />
Published information shows that the undeveloped<br /><br />
energy resources of China are extensive and that China's energy<br /><br />
needs are growing at a high rate. The Chinese government,<br /><br />
further, has recently encouraged foreign participation in the<br /><br />
development of its energy resources, and has demonstrated a<br /><br />
willingness to include independent oil and gas exploration<br /><br />
companies such as the Company in additional energy-related joint<br /><br />
ventures. The Company's excellent relationship with the Chinese<br /><br />
energy-related industry representatives should assist it in<br /><br />
remaining competitive in that country. See "The Zhao Dong Block,"<br /><br />
below. On August 20, 1998, the Company entered into a production<br /><br />
sharing contract with CNODC, effective October 1, 1998, for the<br /><br />
12,000-acre Zhang Dong Block. See "Zhang Dong Block," below.<br /><br />
To expand its energy-related activities in China, on July<br /><br />
17, 1995 the Company signed a contract with CNPC United Lube Oil<br /><br />
Corporation to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, and<br /><br />
marketing of lubricating oil in China and in southeast Asian<br /><br />
markets. See "United/XCL Lube Oil Joint Venture," below. And on<br /><br />
December<br /><br />
14,<br /><br />
1995, the Company signed a<br /><br />
Memorandum<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Understanding with the China National Administration of Coal<br /><br />
Geology ("CNACG"), pursuant to which the parties have begun<br /><br />
cooperative exploration and development of coalbed methane in two<br /><br />
areas of China. See "Coalbed Methane Project," below.<br /><br />
Corporate History; Address; Employees<br /><br />
- ------------------------------------Before 1993, the Company operated primarily in the Gulf<br /><br />
Coast area of the United States. Formerly The Exploration Company<br /><br />
of Louisiana, Inc., XCL Ltd. was incorporated in Delaware in<br /><br />
1987. It is the successor to a Louisiana corporation of the same<br /><br />
name, incorporated in 1981. The Company's principal executive<br /><br />
offices are at 110 Rue Jean Lafitte, 2nd Floor, Lafayette,<br /><br />
Louisiana 70508. Its telephone number is (318) 237-0325.<br /><br />
As of June 30, 1998, the Company's employees totaled 26. No<br /><br />
employees are subject to any union contracts. The Company<br /><br />
believes it maintains good relations with its employees.<br /><br />
The Zhao Dong Block<br /><br />
- ------------------Geology<br /><br />
------The Zhao Dong Block extends from the shoreline of the Dagang<br /><br />
oil field complex on Bohai Bay to water depths of approximately 5<br /><br />
meters. It encompasses approximately 197 square km (roughly<br /><br />
50,000 gross acres). Geologic information suggests that a portion<br /><br />
of the Zhao Dong Block is a seaward extension of the Dagang oil<br /><br />
field complex which is one of China's largest.<br /><br />
According to<br /><br />
statistics published by Wood McKenzie in the Southeast Asia<br /><br />
Report, Dagang has produced over 700 million barrels of oil and<br /><br />
has an estimated ultimate recovery of substantially more.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company has not verified this published information.<br /><br />
Tertiary formations constitute a major portion of the Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block's production, its geology being in many respects<br /><br />
similar to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Bohai Bay sediments are however<br /><br />
non-marine and oil prone, while the U.S. Gulf Coast sediments are<br /><br />
open-marine and gas and condensate prone. Seismic and subsurface<br /><br />
data appear to indicate a thick, structured sedimentary section<br /><br />
in the contract area. Proximity to producing fields and highly<br /><br />
productive test results from the wells which have been drilled<br /><br />
suggest excellent source rock.<br /><br />
Seismic<br /><br />
-------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Seismic data were acquired in and around the Zhao Dong Block<br /><br />
by shallow water and transition zone seismic crews from 1986 to<br /><br />
1988. While the original processing of the data was fair in<br /><br />
reflection continuity, the Company's initial evaluation involved<br /><br />
reprocessing 721 km, resulting in dramatic improvement for both<br /><br />
structural and stratigraphic interpretation. This reprocessing,<br /><br />
plus 390 km of new seismic data (outlined below), make available<br /><br />
a current total of 1,111 km of 2D seismic data in and around the<br /><br />
Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
From 1993 through 1995 the Company acquired an additional<br /><br />
390 km of 2D seismic data shot by Dagang Geophysical, a Chinese<br /><br />
firm, all of which assisted the Company in assessing the Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block's potential.<br /><br />
A 1997 3-D seismic program was designed to delineate<br /><br />
development well locations in the C-D Field and to better define<br /><br />
exploration prospects on the remainder of the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
program covered approximately 100 square km and cost<br /><br />
approximately $5.5 million; the Company's share was approximately<br /><br />
$2.75 million. A similar program (at a comparable cost) will be<br /><br />
undertaken in 1998 to cover most of the rest of the Zhao Dong<br /><br />
Block.<br /><br />
Drilling Results<br /><br />
---------------Mapping of seismic events on shallow, medium, and deep<br /><br />
reflections delineated possibly productive lead areas. Subsequent<br /><br />
exploratory drilling resulted in three successful discoveries<br /><br />
along<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Zhao Bei fault system. Appraisal<br /><br />
tests<br /><br />
have<br /><br />
structurally and stratigraphically delineated the aerial extent<br /><br />
of both the "C" and the "D" segments of the C-D Field.<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons have been found in the Lower Minghuazhen (Pliocene),<br /><br />
the Guantao (Miocene), and the Shahejie (Oligocene) formations.<br /><br />
Appraisal drilling commenced in 1998 to delineate the extent of<br /><br />
the 1997 C-4 discovery located northeast of the C-D Field. The C4<br /><br />
well<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
productive from the Shahejie Formation<br /><br />
and,<br /><br />
additionally, from Jurassic and Permian Age sediments.<br /><br />
The Company's drilling programs, year by year, have been as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
1994 Drilling<br /><br />
------------Zhao Dong C-1. The first of three Phase 1 exploratory<br /><br />
wells, C-1 was spudded in April 1994, and drilled to a depth<br /><br />
of 9,843 feet. Oil was tested in two Pliocene sands of the<br /><br />
Lower Minghuazhen Formation, from perforations shot between<br /><br />
4,278 and 4,462 feet, and yielded a combined test rate of<br /><br />
2,160 BOPD with no water. Total net pay for the zones tested<br /><br />
was 97 feet.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong C-2. Spudded and drilled in October 1994, the<br /><br />
C-2 appraisal well was drilled to a depth of 7,134 feet and<br /><br />
confirmed the C-1 discovery. Tested from four intervals,<br /><br />
between 4,267 and 4,481 feet, the combined rate of three of<br /><br />
the zones was 3,640 BOPD with no water. Total net pay for<br /><br />
the zones tested was 47 feet.<br /><br />
1995 Drilling<br /><br />
------------Zhao Dong C-2-2. Drilled directionally in April 1995 to<br /><br />
a measured depth of 5,625 feet (5,034 feet true vertical<br /><br />
depth), the C-2-2 appraisal was shaled out for prospective<br /><br />
sands<br /><br />
in the Minghuazhen and then plugged back<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
sidetracked as C-2-2A.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong C-2-2A. After plugging and abandoning the<br /><br />
bottom section of the C-2-2 well, the C-2-2A sidetrack well<br /><br />
was drilled structurally updip of the original wellbore to a<br /><br />
measured depth of 5,084 feet (4,956 true vertical depth).<br /><br />
Although Minghuazhen prospective sands were present and not<br /><br />
shaled out, the objective sands were water wet. Accordingly,<br /><br />
the well was plugged and abandoned.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Zhao Dong D-1. Designed to test the Ordovician<br /><br />
Carbonate section, the D-1 exploratory well reached a depth<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
8,784 feet in June 1995. Although no hydrocarbon<br /><br />
potential was found in the Ordovician Carbonates, oil was<br /><br />
found in the Lower Minghuazhen, proving this shallower<br /><br />
section to be productive upthrown to the Zhao Bei fault<br /><br />
system. Drill-stem testing, with perforations at 4,185 to<br /><br />
4,205 feet, confirmed hydrocarbons with an initial rate of<br /><br />
1,330 BOPD. The net pay for this zone was 20 feet.<br /><br />
Although the D-1 was designed primarily to test deeper<br /><br />
Paleozoic objectives, from 3,523 to 6,268 feet it yielded<br /><br />
another 15 sands ranging in age from Pliocene Minghuazhen to<br /><br />
Permian with hydrocarbon shows in mudlogs and/or sidewall<br /><br />
cores. One Permian sand tested water with a trace of 30<br /><br />
gravity oil; one Minghuazhen sand tested water with 2% oil.<br /><br />
Located on the eastern edge of the C-D structural<br /><br />
complex, the D-1 was not optimally placed to explore the<br /><br />
shallower hydrocarbon-containing sands. But the fact that it<br /><br />
tested 1,330 BOPD from one sand, tested water with smaller<br /><br />
amounts of oil from two other sands, and had shows in<br /><br />
numerous additional sands, suggests proximity to the limits<br /><br />
of a significant oil accumulation. Accordingly, the D-2<br /><br />
well, discussed under 1996 Drilling, below, was designed to<br /><br />
appraise the D-1 discovery at a much higher structural<br /><br />
position. See also the discussion, immediately below, of a<br /><br />
parallel relationship between and among the C-3, C-2, and C1 wells.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong C-3. Although scheduled to be drilled to<br /><br />
5,004 feet,<br /><br />
this appraisal well, drilled in July 1995,<br /><br />
reached a total depth of 6,773 feet. Analysis of geological<br /><br />
information during drilling had shown that the C-3 was<br /><br />
structurally higher than both the C-1 and C-2, and so<br /><br />
drilling continued to test the Shahejie Formation until, at<br /><br />
approximately 6,595 feet, the Zhao Bei fault was crossed.<br /><br />
Eight different sands had drill-stem tests; seven were found<br /><br />
to be productive, as compared to only three and two for the<br /><br />
C-2 and C-1. (The C-1 and C-2 did however have oil shows in<br /><br />
several sands found to be productive in the C-3.) Cumulative<br /><br />
rate potential was 5,830 BOPD and 460 Mcfpd; one Shahejie<br /><br />
sand tested oil at 1,356 BOPD until water production began.<br /><br />
(Initial analysis indicates the water was coned due to<br /><br />
pressure draw-down during testing.) Total net pay for the<br /><br />
zones tested was 143 feet.<br /><br />
The C-3 thus indicates that Shahejie Formation sands<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
productive<br /><br />
with significant<br /><br />
appraisal<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
exploration potential, both in the C-D Field and over much<br /><br />
of the as yet undrilled portion of the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
Initial seismic stratigraphic analysis indicates additional<br /><br />
lacustrine fan systems could be present downdip.<br /><br />
1996 Drilling<br /><br />
------------Zhao Dong D-2. Spudded in November 1996, the D-2<br /><br />
appraisal<br /><br />
well was designed to test the<br /><br />
Minghuazhen<br /><br />
(Pliocene) and Guantao (Miocene) sands upthrown to the Zhao<br /><br />
Bei fault system, as well as the Shahejie (Oligocene)<br /><br />
Formation downthrown to a bifurcated fault of the same fault<br /><br />
system. It was drilled to a measured depth of 7,501 feet<br /><br />
(6,180 feet true vertical depth), on an upthrown fault<br /><br />
closure approximately 1.5 km west of and structurally higher<br /><br />
than the D-1 discovery well.<br /><br />
Five intervals (six drill-stem tests) from perforations<br /><br />
at 3,285 to 5,445 feet (3,277 to 4,950 feet true vertical<br /><br />
depth) tested at a combined rate of 11,571 BOPD, confirming<br /><br />
the lateral productivity of several sands previously seen<br /><br />
productive and, in the Guantao Formation, establishing<br /><br />
production in several new sands. This well also demonstrated<br /><br />
much higher initial flow rates without the need<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
artificial lift, one zone flowing 4,370 BOPD with 774 Mcfpd<br /><br />
of gas, and a second zone flowing 2,471 BOPD with 168 Mcfpd<br /><br />
of gas.<br /><br />
Sands seen productive in this well appear to be present<br /><br />
over the entire area, adding significantly to the overall<br /><br />
<br /><br />
potential of the C-D Field as well as the rest of the Zhao<br /><br />
Dong Block.<br /><br />
Total net pay for the zones tested was 243<br /><br />
feet.<br /><br />
1997 Drilling<br /><br />
------------Zhao Dong F-1. Planned as an exploratory well to<br /><br />
fulfill Phase I drilling commitments, the F-1 was designed<br /><br />
to test an 1,800+ foot thick section of the Shahejie<br /><br />
Formation on a four-way dip structural closure.<br /><br />
This<br /><br />
exploratory<br /><br />
well<br /><br />
was spudded in<br /><br />
October<br /><br />
1996<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
directionally drilled, from a drill pad built at the<br /><br />
shoreline, to a measured depth of 14,501 feet (10,968 true<br /><br />
vertical depth). Severe mechanical problems prevented the<br /><br />
well from being fully evaluated, and two sidetrack attempts<br /><br />
were unsuccessful. Drilling operations under a turnkey<br /><br />
contract have been abandoned. A number of Shahejie sands<br /><br />
were encountered, with some apparent oil shows.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong D-3. The second appraisal well for the D-1<br /><br />
discovery, and located approximately 1 km north of the D-1,<br /><br />
the D-3 was spudded in June 1997 and drilled to a depth of<br /><br />
5,740 feet. Although no drill-stem tests were performed<br /><br />
(since the data collected were sufficient to confirm the<br /><br />
productive nature of the reservoirs and since the rig was<br /><br />
needed to drill the C-4 Well), using wireline tools, oil was<br /><br />
recovered from several sands, most of which had tested oil<br /><br />
in the D-2 and D-1 wells, as well as from three new<br /><br />
productive sands for the "D" segment. Total net pay for the<br /><br />
productive zone was 89 feet. The D-3 Well thus solidified<br /><br />
structural interpretation and confirmed productive areas.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong C-4. An exploratory well designed to test PreTertiary and Shahejie Formations, the C-4 was spudded in<br /><br />
July 1997, on a separate structure approximately 2 km<br /><br />
northeast of the C-1, and was drilled to a depth of 8,993<br /><br />
feet. Eight zones tested at a combined rate of 15,349 BOPD,<br /><br />
6,107 Mcfpd of gas, and 14 barrels of condensate per day.<br /><br />
Total net pay for the zones tested was 209 feet.<br /><br />
The C-4 proved the presence and productivity of<br /><br />
multiple Oligocene Age Shahejie sands on the Zhao Dong<br /><br />
Block's northern portion. The C-4 also found multiple highquality Cretaceous and Jurassic sands, not encountered in<br /><br />
previous drilling, present and productive, indicating that<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
sands may be present and prospective elsewhere.<br /><br />
Significantly, the Shahejie, Cretaceous and Jurassic sands<br /><br />
contained higher gravity oil (28 to 38 degree API) and more<br /><br />
gas, indicating higher reservoir energy than previously<br /><br />
encountered. All zones tested exhibited natural flow.<br /><br />
1998 Drilling<br /><br />
------------Zhao Dong C-4-2. An appraisal well for the C-4 (the C4-2), located approximately 1.3 km south of the C-4, was<br /><br />
spudded in August 1998. The C-4-2 well is being drilled to<br /><br />
delineate the size of the reservoir encountered in the C-4<br /><br />
well.<br /><br />
The well is expected to be drilled to a depth of<br /><br />
approximately 9,700 feet to test the Shahejie, Cretaceous<br /><br />
and Jurassic Sands encountered in the C-4 well.<br /><br />
Zhao Dong C-5.<br /><br />
Also in August 1998, the<br /><br />
C-5<br /><br />
exploration well located approximately 3 km southwest of the<br /><br />
D-2 well commenced drilling. The C-5 well was drilled to a<br /><br />
depth of 7,646 feet.<br /><br />
No commercial oil and gas was<br /><br />
encountered and the well was plugged and abandoned.<br /><br />
Exploration Potential<br /><br />
- --------------------Reconnaissance seismic surveys on the Zhao Dong Block have<br /><br />
led the Company's independent petroleum engineers to identify, in<br /><br />
addition to the C-D Field and the C-4 discovery, twenty-six<br /><br />
prospective areas with exploratory potential. Seismic data over<br /><br />
these prospective areas have been analyzed and the potential<br /><br />
reserves are being evaluated.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Future Drilling Plans<br /><br />
- --------------------The Company, Apache, and CNODC have approved a five-well<br /><br />
drilling program for 1998, which will include an appraisal well<br /><br />
(the Zhao Dong C-4-2, referred to above, which commenced drilling<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
August 1998) to appraise the C-4 discovery and<br /><br />
four<br /><br />
exploratory wells, at least two of which will be in the "C" and<br /><br />
"D" segments (and one of which was the Zhao Dong C-5, referred to<br /><br />
above.<br /><br />
At least two of these wells are expected to be drilled<br /><br />
during the 1999 drilling season.<br /><br />
The Contract<br /><br />
- -----------The Company acquired the rights to the exploration,<br /><br />
development and production of the Zhao Dong Block by executing a<br /><br />
Production<br /><br />
Sharing Agreement with CNODC, a Chinese<br /><br />
state<br /><br />
enterprise, effective May 1, 1993 (the "Contract"). The Contract<br /><br />
includes the following terms:<br /><br />
The Foreign Contractor (the Company and Apache as a group,<br /><br />
working through a participation agreement) must pay for all<br /><br />
exploration costs. If a commercial discovery is made and if<br /><br />
CNODC exercises its option to participate, development and<br /><br />
operating costs and allocable remainder oil and gas production<br /><br />
are shared up to 51% by CNODC and the remainder by the Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
work under the Contract is divided into three<br /><br />
categories,<br /><br />
Exploration,<br /><br />
Development<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Production.<br /><br />
Exploration, Development and Production operations can occur<br /><br />
concurrently on different areas of the Zhao Dong Block.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Contract is not to continue beyond 30 consecutive years.<br /><br />
All<br /><br />
exploration work must be completed during the Exploration Period<br /><br />
(which expires April 30, 2000). The Production Period for each<br /><br />
oil field covered by the Contract is 15 years, starting with the<br /><br />
date of first production for that field.<br /><br />
Exploration Period<br /><br />
-----------------Work performed and expenses incurred during this period,<br /><br />
consisting of three phases totaling seven contract years and<br /><br />
beginning as of May 1, 1993, are the exclusive responsibility of<br /><br />
the Foreign Contractor. The Contract mandates certain minimal<br /><br />
requirements for drilling, seismic and expenditures during each<br /><br />
phase of the Exploration Period. The Foreign Contractor has<br /><br />
elected to enter the third exploration phase (expiring April 30,<br /><br />
2000). The minimum work requirements for seismic and the minimum<br /><br />
expenditures for the balance of the Contract have been met. This<br /><br />
leaves only the drilling requirements left to be satisfied.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Foreign Contractor is required to drill three exploratory wells<br /><br />
prior to the expiration of the Exploration Period.<br /><br />
This will<br /><br />
complete its requirements in the Exploration Period. These three<br /><br />
wells are approved in the 1998 work program and budget and,<br /><br />
subject to rig availability (and, as to one of the wells,<br /><br />
location approval), are expected to be drilled in 1998 or 1999.<br /><br />
Development Period<br /><br />
------------------The Development Period for any field discovered during the<br /><br />
Exploration Period commences on the date the requisite Chinese<br /><br />
governmental authority approves the development plan for an oil<br /><br />
and/or gas field.<br /><br />
The C-D Field is now in the Development<br /><br />
Period.<br /><br />
Production Period<br /><br />
----------------The Production Period for any oil and/or gas field covered<br /><br />
by the Contract (the "Contract Area") will be 15 consecutive<br /><br />
years (each of 12 months), commencing for each such field on the<br /><br />
date of commencement of commercial production (as determined<br /><br />
under the terms of the Contract). However, prior to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Production Period, and during the Development Period, oil and/or<br /><br />
gas may be produced and sold during a long-term testing period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relinquishment<br /><br />
-------------The Company expects that no relinquishment will be required<br /><br />
until Exploration Phase 3 has been concluded. After April 30,<br /><br />
2000, the portions of the Contract area, not including areas in<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
development and/or production activities<br /><br />
have<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
undertaken, must be relinquished.<br /><br />
Termination of the Contract<br /><br />
--------------------------The Contract may be terminated by the Foreign Contractor at<br /><br />
the end of each phase of the Exploration Period, without further<br /><br />
obligation. The parties have elected to go into the third phase<br /><br />
of the Exploration Period.<br /><br />
Post-Production Operating and Exploration Costs<br /><br />
----------------------------------------------After commercial production has begun, the operating costs<br /><br />
incurred in any given calendar year for an oil field shall be<br /><br />
recovered in kind from 60% of that year's oil production. After<br /><br />
recovery of operating costs, the 60% is applied to exploration<br /><br />
costs. Unrecovered operating costs shall be carried forward.<br /><br />
After recovery of operating and exploration costs for any<br /><br />
field, development costs shall be recovered by the Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor and CNODC from 60% of the remaining oil production,<br /><br />
plus deemed interest at 9%.<br /><br />
Natural gas shall be allocated according to the same general<br /><br />
principles, but in order to ensure reasonable benefit for the<br /><br />
Foreign Contractor the allocation percentages shall be adjusted<br /><br />
in the light of actual economic conditions.<br /><br />
Annual gross production ("AGP") of each oil and gas field<br /><br />
shall be allocated in kind in the following sequences and<br /><br />
percentages:<br /><br />
(1)<br /><br />
taxes.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5 percent of AGP shall be allocated to pay Chinese<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(2)<br /><br />
The Chinese government shall receive a sliding<br /><br />
scale royalty, determined on a field by field basis, calculated<br /><br />
as follows (as amended by the Ministry and State Taxation Bureau,<br /><br />
effective January 1, 1995):<br /><br />
METRIC TONS OF ANNUAL<br /><br />
CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION<br /><br />
ROYALTY RATE<br /><br />
(One metric ton is roughly equivalent to seven<br /><br />
barrels of crude oil)<br /><br />
Up to and including 1,000,000..................<br /><br />

8%<br /><br />
10%<br /><br />
12.5%<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(3)<br /><br />
60% of AGP shall be deemed "cost recovery oil" and<br /><br />
used for cost recovery, first of operating costs, and second for<br /><br />
exploration and development costs (including deemed interest).<br /><br />
Cost recovery oil shall not be reduced by any royalty due the<br /><br />
Chinese government.<br /><br />
(4)<br /><br />
After recovery of operating, exploration, and<br /><br />
development costs (including deemed interest), the remainder of<br /><br />
AGP shall be considered "remainder oil," which shall then be<br /><br />
further divided into "allocable remainder oil" and "Chinese share<br /><br />
oil." Allocable remainder oil shall be calculated for each field,<br /><br />
based upon a sliding scale formula applied to each such field's<br /><br />
annual production, and shall be shared by the parties in<br /><br />
proportion to their respective interests under the Contract. All<br /><br />
oil remaining after the above allocations shall be designated<br /><br />
Chinese share oil and allocated to CNODC or other Chinese<br /><br />
government designee.<br /><br />
Administration of the Contract; Arbitration<br /><br />
<br /><br />
- ------------------------------------------The Contract is administered by the JMC, consisting of an<br /><br />
equal number of representatives designated by CNODC and by the<br /><br />
Foreign Contractor. Disputes must be resolved, first through<br /><br />
negotiation, and then arbitration (though CNODC may have the<br /><br />
right to seek resolution in Chinese courts). CNODC has not waived<br /><br />
sovereign immunity in any proceedings commenced in China.<br /><br />
If accepted by the parties, arbitration will be conducted by<br /><br />
the China International Economic and Trade Commission under its<br /><br />
provisional rules. If that is not accepted by the parties,<br /><br />
disputes may be arbitrated by a panel of three arbitrators, each<br /><br />
party to appoint one and the third appointed by the two thus<br /><br />
chosen or, failing such appointment, by the Arbitration Institute<br /><br />
of the Stockholm (Sweden) Chamber of Commerce. Arbitration shall<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
conducted<br /><br />
under the rules of the UN<br /><br />
Commission<br /><br />
on<br /><br />
International Trade Law of 1976 (subject however to such rules as<br /><br />
expressly provided in the Contract). Awards shall be final and<br /><br />
binding on the parties. The Contract is governed by Chinese law.<br /><br />
Apache Farmout<br /><br />
- -------------In March 1994, by means of a participation agreement<br /><br />
("Participation Agreement"), the Company farmed out a one-third<br /><br />
interest in the Foreign Contractor's interest in the Zhao Dong<br /><br />
Block to Apache in exchange for certain cash payments and<br /><br />
Apache's agreement to assume its pro rata share of expenditures<br /><br />
and liabilities with respect to exploration and development.<br /><br />
As<br /><br />
required by the Participation Agreement, in June 1994, Apache and<br /><br />
the Company entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (the<br /><br />
"Operating<br /><br />
Agreement').<br /><br />
To further reduce<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
exploration capital requirements and accelerate the development<br /><br />
of the Zhao Dong Block, the Company and Apache entered into an<br /><br />
agreement on May 10, 1995 (the "Second Participation Agreement")<br /><br />
pursuant to which Apache increased its interest in the Contract<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
50%<br /><br />
of the Foreign Contractor's interest and assumed<br /><br />
operatorship, obligating itself to pay 100% of the costs of<br /><br />
drilling and testing four exploratory wells (the "Carried Wells")<br /><br />
on the Zhao Dong Block. The drilling and testing of the C-3, D1, D-2 and F-1 wells will satisfy the obligations regarding the<br /><br />
four Carried Wells. All of these wells have been drilled and<br /><br />
tested with the exception of the F-1 Well, drilling operations on<br /><br />
which have been abandoned. The Company does not believe that such<br /><br />
operations on the F-1 Well to date satisfy Apache's obligations<br /><br />
to deliver a fourth Carried Well. The amounts advanced by Apache<br /><br />
for the Company's share of the Carried Wells are recoverable from<br /><br />
a portion of the Company's share of cost recovery revenues from<br /><br />
the Zhao Dong Block. In addition, Apache obligated itself to pay<br /><br />
the Company 16.667% of the value of the recoverable proved<br /><br />
reserves attributable to the portion of the Zhao Dong Block<br /><br />
delineated by the drilling of the C-1 and C-2 and C-3 wells, the<br /><br />
combined area designated in the agreement as the "C Field," all<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
agreed<br /><br />
to by the Company and Apache in the<br /><br />
Second<br /><br />
Participation Agreement. Payment for this purchase will be<br /><br />
computed in accordance with evaluation methodology as set forth<br /><br />
in the Second Participation Agreement and made to the Company<br /><br />
from time to time as each segment of the field is placed on<br /><br />
production.<br /><br />
In consideration of the above described payments, Apache<br /><br />
assumed operatorship of the Zhao Dong Block and increased its<br /><br />
interest from 33.33% to 50% of the Foreign Contractor's share.<br /><br />
All future exploration expenditures in excess of the Carried<br /><br />
Wells will be borne 50% each by the Company and Apache.<br /><br />
Under<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Operating Agreement, approval of a successor operator<br /><br />
requires<br /><br />
the vote of not less than 55% of the<br /><br />
Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor's interest; if the operator reduces its participating<br /><br />
interest to less than 25%, a committee established under the<br /><br />
Operating Agreement comprised of Apache and XCL (the "Operating<br /><br />
Committee") shall vote on whether a successor operator should be<br /><br />
named.<br /><br />
The appointment of a successor or replacement operator<br /><br />
requires government approval. CNODC has the right to become<br /><br />
operator<br /><br />
of production operations in certain circumstances<br /><br />
described in the Contract.<br /><br />
All work under the Contract must be pursuant to a work<br /><br />
program and budget approved by the JMC. Each year, the Operating<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Committee must submit a proposed work program and budget to the<br /><br />
JMC.<br /><br />
Operating Committee approval of this work program and<br /><br />
budget requires the vote of not less than 55% of the Foreign<br /><br />
Contractor's interest.<br /><br />
If 55% of the Foreign Contractor's<br /><br />
interest does not vote in favor of a proposed work program and<br /><br />
budget, the operator must submit the minimum work program and<br /><br />
budget necessary to meet the contractual obligations of the<br /><br />
Foreign Contractor under the Contract.<br /><br />
Under<br /><br />
the Participation Agreement and the Operating<br /><br />
Agreement, Apache and the Company each has a right of first<br /><br />
refusal with respect to any sale or transfer of interest in the<br /><br />
Foreign Contractor's share of the Contract. In addition, under<br /><br />
the Participation Agreement Apache and the Company each has a<br /><br />
right of first refusal with respect to the sale of 50% or more of<br /><br />
outstanding voting capital stock of their respective subsidiaries<br /><br />
party to the Contract and the Participation Agreement. In<br /><br />
addition, each party has the option to purchase the other party's<br /><br />
interest in the Contract upon the occurrence of certain "option<br /><br />
events." Option events include the failure more than twice in one<br /><br />
year to pay sums due under the Operating Agreement, after<br /><br />
receiving written notice of default and failing to cure within<br /><br />
any applicable cure period provided by the Operating Agreement<br /><br />
(if nonpayment is the subject of dispute and arbitration under<br /><br />
the Operating Agreement, it does not constitute a "failure to<br /><br />
pay"<br /><br />
until an arbitral decision is rendered against<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
nonpayor), the inability of a party to pay its debts as they fall<br /><br />
due or a final unappealable order by a court of competent<br /><br />
jurisdiction liquidating the party or appointing a receiver to<br /><br />
take possession of all of the party's assets, the transfer of<br /><br />
more than 49% of the voting shares of the Apache subsidiary<br /><br />
holding Apache's interest in the Zhao Dong Block or XCL-China<br /><br />
Ltd. ("XCL-China"), the XCL subsidiary holding XCL's interest in<br /><br />
the Zhao Dong Block, by their respective parents, or certain<br /><br />
other defaults under the Operating Agreement or the Contract.<br /><br />
The consideration to be paid on the exercise of the option to<br /><br />
purchase is the fair market value of the interest assigned.<br /><br />
If<br /><br />
the parties cannot agree on the fair market value of the<br /><br />
interest, it is to be determined by arbitration.<br /><br />
This option<br /><br />
runs only to the benefit of Apache and XCL-China and may not be<br /><br />
transferred by either of them to any third party.<br /><br />
United/XCL Lube Oil Joint Venture<br /><br />
- --------------------------------On<br /><br />
<br /><br />
July 17, 1995, the Company signed a contract with CNPC<br /><br />
United Lube Oil Corporation to form a joint venture company to<br /><br />
engage in the manufacturing, distribution and marketing of<br /><br />
lubricating oil in China and southeast Asian markets. The joint<br /><br />
venture has a 30-year life unless extended.<br /><br />
The registered<br /><br />
capital of the joint venture is $4.9 million, with the Company to<br /><br />
contribute<br /><br />
$2.4 million for its 49% interest,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
last<br /><br />
installment of which was paid in late 1997. As its investment<br /><br />
for 51% of the stock, the Chinese contributed an existing<br /><br />
lubricating oil blending plant in Langfang, China, with a Chinese<br /><br />
government appraised value of $2.5 million. The registration of<br /><br />
the joint venture was approved by Chinese authorities and the<br /><br />
effective date of the joint venture is January 1, 1998. In a<br /><br />
letter of intent executed contemporaneously with the contract,<br /><br />
the parties have agreed to consider the feasibility of (i)<br /><br />
contributing to the joint venture a second existing plant in<br /><br />
southwest China and (ii) other projects, including constructing<br /><br />
oil terminals on the north and south coasts of China and engaging<br /><br />
in upgrading certain existing refineries within China.<br /><br />
The Langfang plant is located 50 km southeast of Beijing.<br /><br />
The facility is built on a 10-acre site and has been evaluated on<br /><br />
the basis of U.S. Gulf Coast costs at a replacement value of $7.0<br /><br />
million, without taking into account the land value. The plant<br /><br />
currently produces and markets approximately 5,000 metric tons of<br /><br />
lube oil per year. Approximately $1.5 million of the Company's<br /><br />
investment has been allocated to the physical upgrading of the<br /><br />
facility, including the installation of automated filling lines<br /><br />
and packaging systems. Upon completion of the upgrading, the<br /><br />
plant's production capacity will be approximately 20,000 metric<br /><br />
tons per year, assuming one eight hour shift, five days per week.<br /><br />
Additional capacity will be available by adding shifts and<br /><br />
expanding the work week. Further capital improvements estimated<br /><br />
to cost $15 million could increase capacity to approximately<br /><br />
<br /><br />
100,000 metric tons per year.<br /><br />
It is the Company's opinion that an essential element to the<br /><br />
success of the lube oil business in China will be the ability to<br /><br />
distribute the product. In order to assure adequate distribution<br /><br />
of the joint venture's products, the Company has entered into a<br /><br />
memorandum of understanding with the Coal Ministry in China which<br /><br />
is expected to be reduced to a formal distribution contract. The<br /><br />
Coal Ministry operates 125 major integrated distribution centers<br /><br />
throughout China and the Company expects to market the joint<br /><br />
venture's products through this system.<br /><br />
Coalbed Methane Project<br /><br />
- ----------------------On March 31, 1995, the Company signed an agreement with the<br /><br />
CNACG, pursuant to which the parties will commence cooperation<br /><br />
for the exploration and development of coalbed methane in two<br /><br />
areas in China.<br /><br />
During the study period contemplated by the<br /><br />
agreement, the Company will evaluate the properties, after which<br /><br />
the parties are expected to enter into a comprehensive agreement<br /><br />
as to the specifically designated areas, which may provide the<br /><br />
basis for coalbed methane development in other areas of China.<br /><br />
On December 14, 1995, the Company signed a Memo of Understanding<br /><br />
with CNACG to develop a contract for exploration, development and<br /><br />
utilization of coalbed methane in the two areas. The March 31,<br /><br />
1995 agreement expired by its terms on December 31, 1996;<br /><br />
however, the Company has been informally advised that CNACG will<br /><br />
extend the term of the agreement.<br /><br />
Zhang Dong Block<br /><br />
- ---------------On August 20, 1998, XCL (through its subsidiary XCL-Cathay<br /><br />
Ltd.) signed a production sharing contract with CNODC for the<br /><br />
12,000-acre Zhang Dong Block. On September 15, 1998, the contract<br /><br />
was approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic<br /><br />
Cooperation of China, effective October 1, 1998. The Zhang Dong<br /><br />
Block is located North and adjacent to the Zhao Dong Block in the<br /><br />
offshore area of Bohai Bay. Dagang Petroleum (the subsidiary of<br /><br />
CNPC that operates onshore fields in this area) has drilled and<br /><br />
tested nine wells in the offshore block. All but one of these<br /><br />
wells have been drilled from an artificial island or a causeway<br /><br />
extending into the bay. All nine wells were tested with five<br /><br />
having commercial oil production rates, one well with gas<br /><br />
production, two wells with low oil production rates and one well<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
produced water.<br /><br />
The Company's review of production<br /><br />
information suggests that the wells were drilled with mud weights<br /><br />
that were considerably higher than necessary, which damaged the<br /><br />
producing formation and restricted the flow rates.<br /><br />
Under the<br /><br />
contract, the Company is required in the next year at its expense<br /><br />
to drill one well, upgrade both the island and the causeway and<br /><br />
reprocess and reinterpret certain seismic data. If the Company<br /><br />
elects to extend the appraisal phase of the contract beyond the<br /><br />
first year, it may do so by committing to an additional two wells<br /><br />
during each of the next two-year periods (for a total commitment<br /><br />
of five wells over a five-year period). Development costs and<br /><br />
production will be shared 49% by the Company and 51% by CNODC.<br /><br />
XCL is designated as the operator.<br /><br />
Domestic Properties<br /><br />
- ------------------U.S. Exploration and Production Activities. The Company has<br /><br />
sold substantially all of its U.S. producing properties except<br /><br />
for an interest in the Berry R. Cox Field (the "Cox Field") in<br /><br />
South Texas and is seeking to sell or joint venture its interest.<br /><br />
The Company holds a 60% to 100% working interest in 1,265 acres<br /><br />
in this field on which there are currently four producing wells<br /><br />
(3.45 net wells). The Company's 1997, 1996 and 1995 annual net<br /><br />
sales of natural gas from the Company's interest in the Cox Field<br /><br />
was 72,200, 467,000 and 522,000 Mcf, respectively on a sale<br /><br />
basis.<br /><br />
The December 1997, 1996 and 1995 gas price for the<br /><br />
Company's remaining domestic properties was $2.28, $1.84 and<br /><br />
$1.33 per Mcf, respectively.<br /><br />
During 1996, litigation<br /><br />
was<br /><br />
instituted against the Company in connection with the Cox Field<br /><br />
which has effectively impeded the Company's ability to consummate<br /><br />
a sale of such property. Upon resolution of the litigation, the<br /><br />
Company will continue its efforts to divest itself of these<br /><br />
<br /><br />
properties.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
See "-- Litigation" below.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lutcher Moore Tract. The Company holds, in partnership with<br /><br />
one of its subsidiaries, a fee interest in a 62,500 acre<br /><br />
undeveloped tract of Louisiana fee property located in Ascension,<br /><br />
St. James and St. John the Baptist Parishes, Louisiana (the<br /><br />
"Lutcher Moore Tract"). Expressions of interest to purchase the<br /><br />
property have been received from several parties.<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
is also evaluating the possibility of developing the property<br /><br />
into a source of wetland mitigation credits. In connection with<br /><br />
the acquisition of the Lutcher Moore Tract, the Company's indirect<br /><br />
ownership of such tract is subject to a first mortgage, with a<br /><br />
current principal balance of approximately $1.5 million, and a<br /><br />
number of sellers' notes, with an aggregate current principal<br /><br />
balance of approximately $0.5 million (collectively, the "Lutcher<br /><br />
Moore Debt"). Recourse by the holder of the first mortgage and<br /><br />
the holders of the sellers' notes is limited to the Lutcher Moore<br /><br />
Tract,<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
neither<br /><br />
the Company<br /><br />
nor<br /><br />
its<br /><br />
wholly-owned<br /><br />
subsidiaries, XCL-Land Ltd. and The Exploration Company of<br /><br />
Louisiana, Inc., liable for the debt.<br /><br />
Oil and Gas Reserves<br /><br />
- --------------------Based on the report of Gruy, the Company's independent<br /><br />
engineering firm, net proved reserves in the C-D Field are<br /><br />
estimated to be 11.76 million barrels as of January 1, 1998.<br /><br />
CNODC has exercised its option to pay 51% of all development<br /><br />
costs and receive 51% of oil production. Consequently, the<br /><br />
Company's present value of estimated future pre-tax net cash<br /><br />
flows is approximately $64.8 million. The standarized measure of<br /><br />
discounted future net cash flows determined in accordance with<br /><br />
the rules prescribed by FASB No. 69 is $53.8 million. Future<br /><br />
reserve values are based on year end prices and operating costs,<br /><br />
production and future development costs based on current costs<br /><br />
with no escalation. See "Risk Factors -- Reliance on Estimates<br /><br />
of Proved Reserves and Future Net Revenue" and "Supplemental Oil<br /><br />
and Gas Information" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial<br /><br />
Statements.<br /><br />
Gruy has been preparing reserve estimates for the Company's<br /><br />
oil and gas reserves since August 1996. Gruy was selected by the<br /><br />
Company for this task based upon its reputation, experience and<br /><br />
expertise in this area.<br /><br />
Gruy is an international petroleum<br /><br />
consulting firm with offices in Houston and Dallas, Texas. Their<br /><br />
staff includes petroleum engineers and geologic consultants.<br /><br />
Services they provide include reserve estimates, fair value<br /><br />
appraisals, geologic studies, expert witness testimony<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
arbitration. In 1997 the Company paid Gruy approximately $68,400<br /><br />
in fees for reserve report valuations and other services.<br /><br />
No<br /><br />
instructions were given and no limitations were imposed by the<br /><br />
Company on the scope of or methodology to be used in preparing<br /><br />
the reserve estimates.<br /><br />
Offices<br /><br />
- ------On March 31, 1997, the Company sold its office building<br /><br />
located at 110 Rue Jean Lafitte, Lafayette, Louisiana for<br /><br />
$900,000. On the same day, the Company entered into a lease with<br /><br />
the purchaser for one floor (approximately 9,500 square feet) of<br /><br />
the two-story building for a term of 22 months with an option to<br /><br />
extend for an additional eight-month period, at a monthly rental<br /><br />
of $7,500 for the first 21 months and $6,039 for the last month<br /><br />
(which is offset against mortgage payments due from the new owner<br /><br />
of the building).<br /><br />
The outstanding balance of the underlying<br /><br />
mortgage was repaid in full upon the sale of the building. In<br /><br />
March 1998, the Company entered into a lease for approximately<br /><br />
3,400 square feet of office space located at 5487 San Felipe,<br /><br />
Suite 2110 in Houston, Texas. The lease expires December 31,<br /><br />
2000 and has a monthly rental of $5,166. On July 15, 1998, the<br /><br />
Company entered into a lease for approximately 1,649 square feet<br /><br />
of office space located at No. 1013, Office Tower 1, 138 Wang Fu<br /><br />
Jing Da Jie, Beijing, China. The lease expires July 15, 2000<br /><br />
(with an option to extend for an additional two years) and has a<br /><br />
monthly rental of $3,297 (payable in Chinese Renminbi).<br /><br />
Litigation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
- ---------During December 1993, the Company and two of its whollyowned subsidiaries, XCL-Texas, Inc. and XCL Acquisitions, Inc.,<br /><br />
were<br /><br />
sued<br /><br />
in separate lawsuits entitled Ralph Slaughter,<br /><br />
Secretary of the Department of Revenue and Taxation, State of<br /><br />
Louisiana versus The Exploration Company of Louisiana, Inc. (15th<br /><br />
Judicial District, Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, Docket No. 935449); Ralph Slaughter, Secretary of the Department of Revenue<br /><br />
and Taxation, State of Louisiana versus XCL-Texas, Incorporated<br /><br />
(15th Judicial District, Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, Docket<br /><br />
No. 93-5450); and Ralph Slaughter, Secretary, Department of<br /><br />
Revenue and Taxation vs. XCL Acquisitions, Inc. (15th Judicial<br /><br />
District, Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, Docket No. 93-5337) by<br /><br />
the Louisiana Department of Revenue for Louisiana State corporate<br /><br />
franchise and income taxes for the 1987 through 1991 fiscal years<br /><br />
in an aggregate amount (including penalties and interest through<br /><br />
September 1, 1993) of approximately $2.2 million.<br /><br />
Statutory<br /><br />
interest at the rate of 15% per annum on the principal will<br /><br />
continue to accrue from September 1, 1993 until paid. The<br /><br />
Louisiana Department of Revenue has also assessed additional<br /><br />
Louisiana State franchise tax against the Company and/or XCL<br /><br />
Acquisitions, Inc. for the tax years 1991 through 1996 and<br /><br />
additional income tax against XCL Acquisitions, Inc. for the tax<br /><br />
years 1991 and 1995 on the same basis as those set forth in the<br /><br />
lawsuits.<br /><br />
The Company protested the assessments and small<br /><br />
adjustments were made by the Department of Revenue.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
additional income tax assessment for the 1991 and 1995 tax years<br /><br />
is $89,688 and the additional franchise tax assessment for the<br /><br />
tax years 1991 through 1996 totals $1.6 million plus statutory<br /><br />
interest of 15% per annum from the due date until paid and<br /><br />
penalties not to exceed 25% of the total tax due. The Company<br /><br />
believes that these assessments have been adequately provided for<br /><br />
in the consolidated financial statements. The Company has filed<br /><br />
answers to each of these suits and intends to defend them<br /><br />
vigorously. The Company intends to continue to protest the<br /><br />
assessments. The Company believes that it has<br /><br />
meritorious<br /><br />
defenses and has instructed its counsel to contest these claims.<br /><br />
On<br /><br />
<br /><br />
July 26, 1996, three lawsuits were filed against XCLTexas, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entitled<br /><br />
Stroman Ranch Company Ltd., el al. v. XCL-Texas, Inc. (229th<br /><br />
Judicial District, Jim Hogg County, Texas, Cause No. 4550), Frank<br /><br />
Armstrong, et al. v. XCL-Texas, Inc. (229th Judicial District,<br /><br />
Jim Hogg County, Texas, Cause No. 4551), and Stroman Ranch<br /><br />
Company Ltd., et al. v. XCL-Texas, Inc. (229th Judicial District,<br /><br />
Jim Hogg County, Texas, Cause No. 4552). The lawsuits allege<br /><br />
various claims, including a claim that one of the oil and gas<br /><br />
leases in the Berry R. Cox Field should be terminated. The<br /><br />
Company believes the claims made in the lawsuits are without<br /><br />
merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. The lawsuits have<br /><br />
prevented the Company from selling its interest in the Cox Field.<br /><br />
In July 1997, China Investment and Development Corporation<br /><br />
("CIDC"), holders of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock sued<br /><br />
the Company and each of its directors in an action entitled China<br /><br />
Investment and Development Corporation vs. XCL Ltd.; Marsden W.<br /><br />
Miller, Jr.; John T. Chandler; David A. Melman; Fred Hofheinz;<br /><br />
Arthur<br /><br />
W. Hummel, Jr.; Michael Palliser; and Francis<br /><br />
J.<br /><br />
Reinhardt, Jr. (Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and<br /><br />
for New Castle County, Civil Action No. 15783-NC).<br /><br />
The suit<br /><br />
alleged breach of (i) contract, (ii) corporate charter, (iii)<br /><br />
good faith and fair dealing and (iv) fiduciary duty with respect<br /><br />
to the alleged failure of the Company to redeem CIDC's Series B<br /><br />
Preferred shares for a claimed aggregate redemption price of<br /><br />
approximately $5.0 million. Effective December 31, 1997, the<br /><br />
Company and CIDC entered into an interim settlement agreement<br /><br />
pursuant to which the Company paid CIDC $1 million as a deposit<br /><br />
in anticipation of a final settlement and dismissal of the<br /><br />
lawsuit. On March 3, 1998, the final settlement took place and,<br /><br />
shortly thereafter, the deposit was returned to XCL. On March 9,<br /><br />
1998, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.<br /><br />
On<br /><br />
<br /><br />
January 24, 1997, a subsidiary of the Company filed an<br /><br />
action<br /><br />
captioned L.M. Holding Associates, L.P. v. LaRoche<br /><br />
Chemicals, Inc. (23rd Judicial District Court, St. James Parish,<br /><br />
Louisiana, No. 24, 338, Section A). The lawsuit claims that<br /><br />
LaRoche failed to properly maintain its 8" brine line that runs<br /><br />
10 miles across the subsidiary's property in St. James Parish,<br /><br />
Louisiana, discharged brine from this line onto the subsidiary's<br /><br />
<br /><br />
property and no longer has the right to operate said line.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
1998, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining LaRoche<br /><br />
from discharging brine onto the subsidiary's property<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
enjoining LaRoche from continued operation of the 8" brine line<br /><br />
without a scientific system for early detection of leaks and<br /><br />
without periodic monitoring of the line. The Company is seeking<br /><br />
damages and cancellation of LaRoche's right to operate the brine<br /><br />
line.<br /><br />
No trial date has been set. The Company intends to<br /><br />
vigorously prosecute the lawsuit.<br /><br />
Other than as disclosed above, as of the date hereof, there<br /><br />
are no material pending legal proceedings to which either the<br /><br />
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of<br /><br />
their properties are subject which would have a material adverse<br /><br />
effect on the business or properties of the Company, taken as a<br /><br />
whole.<br /><br />

in London in the area of oil and gas placements. From 1977 to<br /><br />
1986 he was head of Henderson Crosthwaite's institutional sales<br /><br />
department, with special responsibility for the oil and gas<br /><br />
division, until its acquisition by Guinness Mahon Bank in 1986.<br /><br />
Mr. Ross was commissioned into the British Army serving with<br /><br />
the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, his last posting being<br /><br />
to Libya where he retired and set up an industrial services<br /><br />
business. Following the Islamic Revolution in 1971, he returned<br /><br />
to the United Kingdom and joined London stockbrokers Northcote &amp;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Co.<br /><br />
In 1974, he joined George Henderson &amp; Co., becoming<br /><br />
partner in 1975, upon the merger with Fenn and Crosthwaite.<br /><br />
Mr.<br /><br />
Ross was appointed as a director of the Company at a meeting of<br /><br />
the Board held April 7, 1998.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Stock Options<br /><br />
- ------------The Company currently maintains one stock option plan which<br /><br />
was adopted by shareholders in 1992 and was amended and restated<br /><br />
in 1997. The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee<br /><br />
and provides for the granting of options to purchase shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock to key employees and directors of the Company, and<br /><br />
certain other persons who are not employees of the Company but<br /><br />
who from time to time provide substantial advice or other<br /><br />
assistance or services to the Company.<br /><br />
On June 2, 1992, shareholders approved the Long-Term Stock<br /><br />
Incentive Plan ("1992 LTSIP"). The 1992 LTSIP was adopted with<br /><br />
the view of conforming the Company's prior plans to certain<br /><br />
regulatory changes adopted by the Commission and affording<br /><br />
holders of previously granted options the opportunity to exchange<br /><br />
their options for equivalent options under the 1992 LTSIP.<br /><br />
By<br /><br />
action of the Board of Directors, effective June 1, 1997, the<br /><br />
1992 LTSIP was amended and restated, and certain awards were<br /><br />
granted thereunder, all subject to approval by shareholders which<br /><br />
was secured at the Company's Special Meeting in Lieu of Annual<br /><br />
Meeting of Shareholders held on December 17, 1997.<br /><br />
1997 LTSIP Restatement<br /><br />
---------------------Nature of Awards.<br /><br />
The 1997 LTSIP Restatement makes<br /><br />
available to the Compensation Committee the power to grant<br /><br />
certain awards ("Awards") to acquire shares of the Company's<br /><br />
Preferred Stock as well as shares of Common Stock.<br /><br />
In common<br /><br />
with the 1992 LTSIP, the 1997 LTSIP Restatement makes available<br /><br />
to the Compensation Committee a number of incentive devices in<br /><br />
addition to Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs") (which are not<br /><br />
available with respect to Preferred Stock) and Nonqualified Stock<br /><br />
Options ("NSOs"), including reload options ("ROs") (which are not<br /><br />
available with respect to Preferred Stock), restricted stock<br /><br />
awards ("RSAs"), and performance units ("PUs") or appreciation<br /><br />
options ("AOs") (which were not authorized under the 1992 LTSIP),<br /><br />
each<br /><br />
of which is described below and in the 1997 LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement. NSOs to acquire Preferred Stock, a new feature, may<br /><br />
include an accrued dividend feature. The Board believes that<br /><br />
these award alternatives will enable the Committee to tailor the<br /><br />
type of compensation to be granted to key personnel to meet both<br /><br />
the Company's and such employee's requirements in the most<br /><br />
efficient manner possible.<br /><br />
Number of Awards.<br /><br />
For Common Stock Awards, the 1997<br /><br />
LTSIP Restatement authorizes an aggregate of 4 million shares (as<br /><br />
adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split) of Common Stock for<br /><br />
issuance pursuant to awards granted thereunder, including grants<br /><br />
to non-employee directors. For Preferred Stock Awards, the 1997<br /><br />
LTSIP Restatement authorizes an aggregate of 200,000 shares of<br /><br />
the Company's Amended Series A Preferred Stock, or any other<br /><br />
series of Preferred Stock of the Company as designated by the<br /><br />
Committee with respect to an Award.<br /><br />
Description of Awards. As set forth above, and like the<br /><br />
1992<br /><br />
LTSIP,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
1997 LTSIP Restatement<br /><br />
authorizes<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Compensation Committee to grant NSOs, ISOs, ROs (i.e., the<br /><br />
granting of additional options, where an employee exercises an<br /><br />
option with previously owned stock, covering the number of shares<br /><br />
tendered as part of the exercise price), RSAs (i.e., stock<br /><br />
awarded to an employee, subject to forfeiture in the event of a<br /><br />
premature termination of employment, failure of the Company to<br /><br />
meet certain performance objectives or other conditions), PUs<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(i.e., share-denominated units credited to the employee's account<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
delivery or cash-out at some future date based upon<br /><br />
performance<br /><br />
criteria to be determined by the Compensation<br /><br />
Committee), and "tax-withholding" (i.e., where the employee has<br /><br />
the option of having the Company withhold shares on exercise of<br /><br />
an award to satisfy tax withholding requirements). AOs (i.e.,<br /><br />
awards in which payments are based upon appreciation in shares or<br /><br />
other criteria determined by the Compensation Committee) are a<br /><br />
new<br /><br />
feature added to the 1992 LTSIP by the 1997<br /><br />
LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement.<br /><br />
Outside Director Awards. The 1997 LTSIP Restatement also<br /><br />
authorizes the Board to grant Awards to non-employee directors<br /><br />
and to set the terms and conditions of such Awards, without the<br /><br />
restrictions previously set forth in the 1992 LTSIP which were<br /><br />
required by certain federal securities law rules since abolished.<br /><br />
Administration of Plan. In keeping with the provisions of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
1992<br /><br />
LTSIP, the Compensation Committee will<br /><br />
develop<br /><br />
administration guidelines from time to time which will define<br /><br />
specific eligibility criteria, the types of awards to<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
employed, whether such awards relate to Common Stock or Preferred<br /><br />
Stock, and the value of such awards. Specific terms of each<br /><br />
Award will be provided in individual Award agreements granted<br /><br />
each Award recipient. Key employees and other individuals who in<br /><br />
the judgment of the Committee may provide a valuable contribution<br /><br />
to the success of the Company and its affiliates will be<br /><br />
eligible.<br /><br />
The Committee may establish different general Award<br /><br />
eligibility criteria for Awards involving Preferred Stock which<br /><br />
may require a higher level of management responsibility and<br /><br />
authority.<br /><br />
Change in Control Provisions. The 1997 LTSIP Restatement<br /><br />
contains change-in-control provisions which provide that the<br /><br />
threshold for determining if a "change in control of XCL" has<br /><br />
occurred as a result of a person or entity acquiring Company<br /><br />
stock has been lowered from 30% to 20% (disregarding the<br /><br />
acquisition of such stock by certain shareholders of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company).<br /><br />
The 1997 LTSIP Restatement retains the 1992 LTSIP's<br /><br />
provisions pursuant to which a "change in control of XCL" will be<br /><br />
deemed to occur as a result of certain contested Board of<br /><br />
Director elections.<br /><br />
If a "change in control of XCL" occurs<br /><br />
pursuant to the provisions described above, ISOs and NSOs then<br /><br />
outstanding will become exercisable in full, the forfeiture<br /><br />
restrictions on any RSAs to the extent then applicable will lapse<br /><br />
and amounts payable with respect to PUs and AOs then outstanding<br /><br />
will become payable in full. Also, under certain Awards<br /><br />
made<br /><br />
under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement (see discussion below) the<br /><br />
occurrence of a "change in control of XCL" could obligate the<br /><br />
Company with respect to making payments with respect to Awards in<br /><br />
cash rather than in kind, or in obligating the Company to<br /><br />
repurchase individuals' shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock<br /><br />
received under certain 1997 LTSIP Restatement Awards.<br /><br />
Under<br /><br />
certain circumstances which are unforeseen at this time, the<br /><br />
existence of the change in control protections for individuals<br /><br />
receiving Awards under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement and resulting<br /><br />
obligations to the Company may impede the consummation of a<br /><br />
change in control of the Company.<br /><br />
Option Exercise Price. Under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement,<br /><br />
the Compensation Committee shall determine the option price of<br /><br />
all NSOs and ISOs; provided, however, in the case of ISOs, the<br /><br />
option price shall not be less than the fair market value of the<br /><br />
Common Stock on the date of grant. Such "fair market value" is<br /><br />
the average of the high and low prices of a share of Common or<br /><br />
Preferred Stock traded on the relevant date, as reported on the<br /><br />
Exchange, or other national securities exchange, or an automated<br /><br />
quotation system, or pursuant to a good faith determination by<br /><br />
the Board of Directors, if not so traded in a public market.<br /><br />
The 1997 LTSIP Restatement does not extend the term of the<br /><br />
1992 LTSIP and, therefore, the 1997 LTSIP Restatement will<br /><br />
terminate (and no further awards thereunder will be granted<br /><br />
after) June 2, 2002. In view of the fact that there is no public<br /><br />
market for the Amended Series A Preferred Stock, the fair market<br /><br />
value of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock on November 10,<br /><br />
1997, determined in good faith by the Board of Directors based<br /><br />
upon the last bid price of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
in the PORTAL Market, as reported to the Company by Jefferies,<br /><br />
was $80.00 per share.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Awards to Management<br /><br />
- -------------------On June 5, 1997, the Board made certain Awards under the<br /><br />
1997 LTSIP Restatement.<br /><br />
These Awards were approved by the<br /><br />
shareholders of the Company in connection with the approval of<br /><br />
the 1997 LTSIP Restatement voted on at the Special Meeting of<br /><br />
Shareholders.<br /><br />
Effective June 1, 1997, M. W. Miller, Jr. was granted an<br /><br />
Appreciation Option with respect to appreciation in the Company's<br /><br />
total market capitalization (as defined) from and after June 1,<br /><br />
1997. See "Appreciation Option for M.W. Miller, Jr." below for a<br /><br />
more detailed discussion of such grant.<br /><br />
The closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the AMEX<br /><br />
on a recent date is set forth on the cover page of this<br /><br />
Prospectus.<br /><br />
The following tables set forth, for those persons named in<br /><br />
the "Summary Compensation Table," information on stock options<br /><br />
granted during 1997 and all stock options outstanding as of<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.<br /><br />
The closing price on the AMEX on June 2, 1997 for the Common<br /><br />
Stock was $0.21875 (which price is not adjusted to reflect the<br /><br />
Reverse Stock Split), and the fair market value of the Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock, based upon last sales price information<br /><br />
in the PORTAL Market of the National Association of Securities<br /><br />
Dealers, Inc. as supplied by Jefferies, was $85.00 on June 2,<br /><br />
1997. Mr. Miller's Appreciation Option (described below) is not<br /><br />
included because of the indeterminate nature of the Award.<br /><br />

an<br /><br />
employment agreement with the Company, determined based upon<br /><br />
a formula whereby each of the individuals was to be offered<br /><br />
a warrant, based upon the length of time of employment with<br /><br />
the Company, for a maximum of two shares of Common Stock for<br /><br />
each dollar of compensation remaining to be paid to such<br /><br />
individual under his agreement (based upon the product of<br /><br />
his highest monthly base salary and the number of months<br /><br />
remaining under his contract), at an exercise price of<br /><br />
$18.75 per share, and (b) for each dollar of salary<br /><br />
reduction for the 15-month period commencing January 1, 1993<br /><br />
through March 31, 1994, as based on the same formula and at<br /><br />
the same exercise price used in the granting of warrants<br /><br />

Appreciation Option for M.W. Miller, Jr.<br /><br />
---------------------------------------Pursuant to the 1997 LTSIP Restatement, the Board approved<br /><br />
an Appreciation Option for M. W. Miller, Jr., which was approved<br /><br />
by shareholders at the December 17, 1997 Special Meeting of the<br /><br />
Shareholders. The Board determined that the Appreciation Option<br /><br />
to M. W. Miller, Jr. was in the best interests of the Company and<br /><br />
its shareholders, and is required in order to retain the services<br /><br />
of Mr. Miller, who has been instrumental in developing the<br /><br />
Company's China activities and in successfully concluding the<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

Mr. Miller with additional incentive to increase the value of the<br /><br />
Company based upon its market capitalization, thereby directly<br /><br />
benefiting the shareholders of the Company by increasing the<br /><br />
value of their investments in the Company.<br /><br />

The Appreciation Option Agreement provides Mr. Miller<br /><br />
with the right, upon his payment of the Exercise Price (as<br /><br />
defined below), to additional compensation (payable in cash or in<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or a combination<br /><br />
thereof, as elected by the Company) based upon 5% of the<br /><br />
difference between the market capitalization of the Company as of<br /><br />
June 1, 1997 and the market capitalization of the Company as of<br /><br />
the date that Mr. Miller exercises the Appreciation Option. For<br /><br />
purposes of the Appreciation Option, the Company's<br /><br />
market<br /><br />
capitalization is the total fair market value of the Company's<br /><br />
outstanding<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock, Preferred<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
outstanding options and warrants. In general, fair market value<br /><br />
is determined based on the trading price of marketable securities<br /><br />
and by the Board of Directors as to the fair market value for<br /><br />
securities for which there is no ready market. Fair market value<br /><br />
as of the date of exercise of the Option is based on the average<br /><br />
fair market value of the 30-day period immediately preceding the<br /><br />
date of the Appreciation Option exercise. On June 1, 1997 and<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, the aggregate market capitalization of the<br /><br />
Company was $161,547,223 and $177,572,416, respectively.<br /><br />
Upon<br /><br />
exercise of his Option, in the event the Company elects to settle<br /><br />
the Option with shares of Stock, Mr. Miller must pay the Company<br /><br />
twenty percent (20%) of the amount he is entitled to receive upon<br /><br />
exercise of the Appreciation Option (before any reduction as<br /><br />
hereinafter set forth), or any increment thereof, up to an<br /><br />
aggregate maximum of $5 million (the "Exercise Price") in cash.<br /><br />
In the event the Company elects to settle the Option in cash, the<br /><br />
amount of cash Mr. Miller will receive will be reduced by the<br /><br />
amount of the Exercise Price. Because Mr. Miller's Appreciation<br /><br />
Option contemplates compensation determined with reference to<br /><br />
increases<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the Company's market capitalization<br /><br />
without<br /><br />
restriction, there is no effective limit on the amount of<br /><br />
compensation which may become payable thereunder. Mr. Miller may<br /><br />
exercise his Appreciation Option as of any June 1 or December 1<br /><br />
commencing June 1, 2002, upon 45 days written notice, in whole or<br /><br />
in 10% increments. In the event that Mr. Miller exercises his<br /><br />
Appreciation Option for less than the total amount available<br /><br />
thereunder, the percentage increment as to which it is exercised<br /><br />
will cease to be available to create additional compensation<br /><br />
opportunity for Mr. Miller based upon subsequent appreciation in<br /><br />
the Company's market capitalization. Mr. Miller's Appreciation<br /><br />
Option expires on June 1, 2007 and will remain exercisable at any<br /><br />
time prior to such expiration notwithstanding his termination of<br /><br />
employment with the Company unless such employment is terminated<br /><br />
by the Company for "cause" or is terminated by Mr. Miller without<br /><br />
"good reason." In keeping with the provisions of the 1997 LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement discussed in "1997 LTSIP Restatement - Change of<br /><br />
Control Provisions," in the event of a "change in control of XCL"<br /><br />
the Appreciation Option will become immediately exercisable and<br /><br />
the Company will be obligated to pay Mr. Miller, in cash, upon<br /><br />
any exercise of his Appreciation Option, at least 40% of the net<br /><br />
amount payable. This obligation may impede the consummation of a<br /><br />
change of control of the Company.<br /><br />

Material Federal Income Tax Effects<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------The following is a general summary of the material federal<br /><br />
income tax effects to the Company under current law of the<br /><br />
various awards which may be granted under the 1997 LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement.<br /><br />
These descriptions do not purport to cover all<br /><br />
potential tax consequences.<br /><br />
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as<br /><br />
amended<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
"Code"),<br /><br />
limits<br /><br />
deductibility<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
certain<br /><br />
compensation for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the<br /><br />
additional four executive officers of the Company who are highest<br /><br />
paid and employed at year end to $1 million per year unless<br /><br />
certain conditions are met which result in compensation being<br /><br />
characterized as "performance-based." Awards under the Plan will<br /><br />
not satisfy the conditions necessary to cause the compensation<br /><br />
earned under them to qualify as "performance-based" compensation,<br /><br />
which is not subject to the deductibility limit of Section 162(m)<br /><br />
of the Code. It is the position of the Board of Directors that<br /><br />
the approach necessary for the design of incentive compensation<br /><br />
that will satisfy the criteria under Section 162(m) of the Code<br /><br />
would compromise the best interests of the Company and its<br /><br />
shareholders.<br /><br />
Certain provisions in the 1997 LTSIP Restatement may afford<br /><br />
the recipient of an Award under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement with<br /><br />
special protections or payments which are contingent upon a<br /><br />
change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in<br /><br />
the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets.<br /><br />
To the extent that they are triggered by the occurrence of any<br /><br />
such event, these special protections or payments may constitute<br /><br />
"parachute payments" which, when aggregated with other "parachute<br /><br />
payments" received by the recipient, could result in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
recipient receiving "excess parachute payments."<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
would not be allowed a deduction for any such "excess parachute<br /><br />
payments" and the recipient of such "excess parachute payments"<br /><br />
would be subject to a nondeductible 20% excise tax upon such<br /><br />
payments in addition to income tax otherwise owed with respect to<br /><br />
such payments.<br /><br />
Section 401(k) Plan<br /><br />
- ------------------In 1989, the Company adopted an employee benefit plan under<br /><br />
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of<br /><br />
employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The Company<br /><br />
has obtained a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue<br /><br />
Service regarding the tax-favored status of this plan. Employees<br /><br />
can contribute up to 10% of their compensation. The Company, at<br /><br />
its discretion and subject to certain limitations, may contribute<br /><br />
up to 75% of the contributions of each participant. The Company<br /><br />
did not make any contributions to the 401(k) Plan in 1997.<br /><br />
Compensation of Directors and Other Arrangements<br /><br />
- -----------------------------------------------The Company reimburses its directors for travel and lodging<br /><br />
expenses<br /><br />
incurred in attending meetings of the Board<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Directors.<br /><br />
Effective January 1, 1990, directors (other than<br /><br />
Messrs. Hummel and Palliser and those directors who are officers<br /><br />
of the Company) were paid an annual retainer of $18,000 plus a<br /><br />
fee of $1,000 for each Board meeting attended. In addition, such<br /><br />
directors were paid a fee of $1,000 for each committee meeting<br /><br />
attended.<br /><br />
In April 1994, the Company entered into separate consulting<br /><br />
agreements with Messrs. Hummel and Palliser, upon their becoming<br /><br />
directors. Each of the agreements is terminable by either of the<br /><br />
parties thereto upon written notice and provides that the<br /><br />
individuals will render consulting services to the Company in<br /><br />
their respective areas of expertise. Pursuant to the terms of<br /><br />
the agreements, each of those directors receives compensation at<br /><br />
the rate of $50,000 per annum, which includes the compensation<br /><br />
they would otherwise be entitled to receive as directors and for<br /><br />
attending meetings of the Board. In addition, pursuant to the<br /><br />
terms of the 1992 LTSIP, Messrs. Hummel, Palliser, Reinhardt and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Hofheinz, each a non-employee director, were each granted stock<br /><br />
options for 6,666 shares of Common Stock exercisable at prices<br /><br />
ranging from $18.75 to $31.59 per share (adjusted for the Reverse<br /><br />
Stock Split).<br /><br />
In June 1997, the Company entered into a consulting<br /><br />
agreement with Mr. Fetters, a director of the Company.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
agreement is for a one-year term ending July 31, 1998, to<br /><br />
continue thereafter on a month to month basis. The agreement may<br /><br />
be terminated by either party on thirty days written notice.<br /><br />
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mr. Fetters is to consult<br /><br />
with the Company on all aspects of the Company's exploration,<br /><br />
development and production projects. For his services Mr. Fetters<br /><br />
is to receive $30,000 per annum, which is in addition to the<br /><br />
compensation he receives as a director for attending meetings of<br /><br />
the Board. In addition to the above compensation, Mr. Fetters is<br /><br />
entitled to receive a finder's fee on certain specifically<br /><br />
identified projects.<br /><br />
Effective June 1, 1997, Messrs. Hummel, Palliser, Reinhardt,<br /><br />
Hofheinz and Fetters were each granted nonqualified stock options<br /><br />
to purchase 66,666 shares of Common Stock (adjusted for the<br /><br />
Reverse Stock Split) exercisable at $3.75 (adjusted for the<br /><br />
Reverse Stock Split) per share under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement.<br /><br />
See "Stock Options - 1997 LTSIP Restatement - Awards<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
Management" herein.<br /><br />
Benjamin B. Blanchet, in his capacity as Executive Vice<br /><br />
President, is entitled to a salary of $80,000 per year for up to<br /><br />
80 hours per month of services.<br /><br />
Effective August 1, 1997, the Company entered into a<br /><br />
Services<br /><br />
Agreement with Mr. Blanchet.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Agreement<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
terminable by either party at any time without cause. Under the<br /><br />
Agreement, Mr. Blanchet is engaged to act as counsel to the<br /><br />
Company to perform from time to time such services as the Company<br /><br />
may request of him in that capacity. In general, compensation<br /><br />
for services under the Services Agreement will be at the rate of<br /><br />
$175 per hour for up to 80 hours per month. Also, under the<br /><br />
Services Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide Mr.<br /><br />
Blanchet with office space, supplies, secretarial assistance, a<br /><br />
library<br /><br />
allowance,<br /><br />
professional<br /><br />
liability<br /><br />
insurance,<br /><br />
reimbursement for continuing legal education expenses and bar<br /><br />
dues. Under the Services Agreement, Mr. Blanchet may, except as<br /><br />
prohibited<br /><br />
by law or the Louisiana Rules of Professional<br /><br />
Responsibility, represent other clients and engage in business<br /><br />
for his own account.<br /><br />
In connection with his employment by the Company, Mr.<br /><br />
Blanchet received from the Company a $100,000 loan to replace<br /><br />
benefits that he forfeited when he withdrew as a partner of<br /><br />
Gordon, Arata, McCollam &amp; Duplantis, L.L.P. to become Executive<br /><br />
Vice President of the Company. The loan is to be repaid over<br /><br />
eight years from annual bonus payments equal to interest, at the<br /><br />
rate of 6.5% per annum, plus one-eighth of the original principal<br /><br />
balance to be paid by the Company to Mr. Blanchet each year and<br /><br />
shall be forgiven in its entirety if (i) the Company shall fail<br /><br />
to pay timely any such bonus payment, shall breach the Services<br /><br />
Agreement or shall terminate his employment without "cause" or<br /><br />
(ii) Mr. Blanchet terminates his employment with "good reason,"<br /><br />
in either case as such terms are defined in the note evidencing<br /><br />
such loan. In January 1998 a bonus payment of $12,500 was paid<br /><br />
to Mr. Blanchet and used by him to pay the first installment on<br /><br />
the note.<br /><br />
Effective August 1, 1997, Benjamin B. Blanchet was granted<br /><br />
an NSO to purchase 400,000 shares of Common Stock for an option<br /><br />
exercise price of $3.75 per share (aggregate purchase price of<br /><br />
$1,500,000.00).<br /><br />
Such Common Stock NSO is exercisable as to<br /><br />
133,334 shares on August 1, 1999; as to 133,333 shares on August<br /><br />
1, 2000 and as to 133,333 shares on August 1, 2001. On that same<br /><br />
date Mr. Blanchet was granted an NSO to purchase 25,000 shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock for an option exercise price of<br /><br />
$85.00 per share (aggregate purchase price of $2,125,000).<br /><br />
Such<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock NSO is exercisable as to 6,250<br /><br />
shares on August 1, 2000; as to 8,750 shares on August 1, 2001<br /><br />
and as to 10,000 shares on August 1, 2002. Mr. Blanchet's NSOs<br /><br />
will expire on August 1, 2007 or, if earlier, the date his<br /><br />
employment is terminated by the Company for cause or the date he<br /><br />
voluntarily terminates his employment without good reason.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Effective June 30, 1998, Mr. Ross was granted nonqualified<br /><br />
stock<br /><br />
options to purchase 66,666 shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
exercisable at $3.75 per share under the 1997 LTSIP Restatement.<br /><br />
During 1997 all regular employees were provided health<br /><br />
insurance, a portion of the premium for which is paid by the<br /><br />
Company, and life and disability insurance based upon a factor of<br /><br />
the employee's base salary.<br /><br />
Employment Agreements; Termination of Employment and Change-inControl Arrangements<br /><br />
- --------------------------------------------------------------Effective April 1, 1994, Messrs. M.W. Miller, Jr., J.T.<br /><br />
Chandler, D.M. Dobbs, and R.C. Cline, in their capacities as<br /><br />
executive and administrative officers of the Company and its<br /><br />
various<br /><br />
subsidiaries, agreed to surrender their employment<br /><br />
agreements in consideration of the issuance of five-year warrants<br /><br />
to purchase Common Stock at an exercise price of $18.75 per share<br /><br />
(adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), subject to customary antidilution adjustments.<br /><br />
The number of warrants issued to such<br /><br />
individuals was determined based upon a formula whereby each of<br /><br />
the individuals was offered a warrant to purchase, based upon the<br /><br />
length of time of employment with the Company, a maximum of two<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock for each dollar of compensation remaining<br /><br />
to be paid to such individual under his agreement (based upon the<br /><br />
product of his highest monthly base salary and the number of<br /><br />
months remaining under his agreement). Accordingly, Mr. Miller<br /><br />
received warrants to purchase 125,000 shares; Mr. Chandler,<br /><br />
68,333 shares; Mr. Dobbs, 38,333 shares; and Mr. Cline, 16,666<br /><br />
shares, all adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split.<br /><br />
Effective January 1, 1989, the Company adopted a policy<br /><br />
addressing severance upon separation from the Company.<br /><br />
Under<br /><br />
this policy benefits due upon a change-in-control as therein<br /><br />
defined range from three months salary for employees with less<br /><br />
than one year of service to 24 months salary for employees with<br /><br />
more than 10 years of service.<br /><br />
Report on Repricing of Options/SARs<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997, there were<br /><br />
no repricings of stock options awarded to any of the named<br /><br />
executive officers.<br /><br />
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------------------------------For the year ended December 31, 1997, the following<br /><br />
nonexecutive directors of the Company, served as members of the<br /><br />
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: Messrs.<br /><br />
M.<br /><br />
Palliser, A.W. Hummel, Jr., F. Hofheinz (Chairman) and F.J.<br /><br />
Reinhardt, Jr. None of the members of the Compensation Committee<br /><br />
were formerly, nor are any members currently, officers or<br /><br />
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.<br /><br />
Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation<br /><br />
------------------------------------------------------The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors<br /><br />
("Committee") establishes the general compensation policies of<br /><br />
the Company, establishes the compensation plans and specific<br /><br />
compensation levels for executive officers and certain other<br /><br />
managers, and administers the Stock Option Plans and Long Term<br /><br />
Stock Incentive Plan. The Committee currently consists of four<br /><br />
independent, nonemployee directors: Messrs. F. Hofheinz, who<br /><br />
serves as Chairman, M. Palliser, Arthur W. Hummel, Jr. and<br /><br />
Francis J. Reinhardt, Jr.<br /><br />
Compensation Policies and Philosophy<br /><br />
- -----------------------------------The Committee has determined that the compensation program<br /><br />
of the Company should not only be adequate to attract, motivate<br /><br />
and retain executives, key employees and other individuals who<br /><br />
the Company believes may make significant contributions to the<br /><br />
Company's results, but should also be linked to the value<br /><br />
delivered to shareholders as reflected in the price of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Company's Common Stock.<br /><br />
The Committee believes that the cash compensation of<br /><br />
executive officers, as well as other key employees, should be<br /><br />
competitive with other similarly situated companies while, within<br /><br />
the Company, being fair and discriminating on the basis of<br /><br />
personal performance.<br /><br />
In general, in establishing total cash<br /><br />
compensation for its executives, the Committee has taken into<br /><br />
account the median cash compensation of executives employed by<br /><br />
competitors including some of the companies reflected in the peer<br /><br />
group identified in the Performance Graph set forth below, which<br /><br />
the Committee believes represent the Company's most direct<br /><br />
competition<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
executive talent. The Committee<br /><br />
receives<br /><br />
recommendations from management as to executive compensation and,<br /><br />
in light of the Company's performance and the economic conditions<br /><br />
facing the Company, determines appropriate compensation levels<br /><br />
for recommendation to the Board of Directors. The Committee does<br /><br />
not assign relative weights to individual factors and criteria<br /><br />
used in determining executive compensation and does not use<br /><br />
quantifiable targets in determining compensation. For 1997, the<br /><br />
Company did not retain the services of a compensation consulting<br /><br />
firm.<br /><br />
Awards of stock options are intended both to retain<br /><br />
executives, key employees and other individuals who the Company<br /><br />
believes may make significant contributions to the Company's<br /><br />
results and to motivate them to improve long-term stock market<br /><br />
performance. Options are granted at or above the prevailing<br /><br />
market price and will have value only if the price of the<br /><br />
Company's Common Stock increases.<br /><br />
Effective January 1, 1994, Section 162(m) of the Internal<br /><br />
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") generally denies a tax<br /><br />
deduction to any publicly held corporation for compensation that<br /><br />
exceeds $1 million paid to certain senior executives in a taxable<br /><br />
year,<br /><br />
subject<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
exception<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
"performance-based<br /><br />
compensation" as defined in the Code and subject to certain<br /><br />
transition provisions. Gains on the exercise of nonqualified<br /><br />
stock options granted through December 31, 1994, will be tax<br /><br />
deductible under the transition rules. Restricted stock awards<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
definition granted after February 17, 1993,<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
deductible. At present the Committee does not intend to recommend<br /><br />
amendment to the Stock Option Plans to meet the restrictive<br /><br />
requirements of the Code.<br /><br />
The Committee believes that annual incentive awards should<br /><br />
be commensurate with performance. It further believes that in<br /><br />
order to meet this objective it needs to have the ability to<br /><br />
exercise its judgment or discretion to evaluate performance<br /><br />
against qualitative criteria. It is the Committee's opinion that<br /><br />
the benefits to the Company of the use of a qualitative approach<br /><br />
to the compensation of senior executives such as the Chairman<br /><br />
outweigh the nonmaterial loss of a portion of the deductions<br /><br />
associated with that compensation.<br /><br />
In recognition of the efforts and sacrifices of management<br /><br />
that had enabled the Company in mid-1997 to be on track to meet<br /><br />
its 1997 goals, the need to retain existing management and the<br /><br />
need to attract qualified and competent personnel, in June 1997,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Board of Directors reassessed the need for adjusting<br /><br />
management's compensation to provide for additional incentives to<br /><br />
management.<br /><br />
As a result of this reassessment, the Board of<br /><br />
Directors approved amendments to and a restatement of the<br /><br />
Company's 1992 LTSIP subject to shareholders approval, which was<br /><br />
obtained on December 17, 1997. These amendments generally made<br /><br />
available to the Committee the authority to grant Awards to<br /><br />
executives employed by the Company entitling such executives to<br /><br />
acquire shares of the Company's Preferred Stock and Common Stock.<br /><br />
They also made available to the Committee the authority to grant<br /><br />
appreciation awards. As described in greater detail in "Awards<br /><br />
to Management," the Board of Directors made, subject to the<br /><br />
approval of the shareholders of the Company, which was obtained<br /><br />
on December 17, 1997, certain Awards under the 1997 LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement effective as of June 1, 1997 (except for awards to<br /><br />
the CFO and an Executive Vice President which were effective<br /><br />
October 6 and August 1, 1997, respectively).<br /><br />
The Committee<br /><br />
believes that the 1997 LTSIP Restatement and the Awards granted<br /><br />
thereunder effectively encourage retention and continuity of<br /><br />
management,<br /><br />
appropriately reward management for<br /><br />
its<br /><br />
past<br /><br />
performance and align the interests of management with those of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Company's shareholders by providing management with<br /><br />
opportunity to share in the creation of the Company's value.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On December 17, 1997, the Committee reviewed the Company's<br /><br />
1997 financial results and 1997 nonfinancial goals and determined<br /><br />
that, in light of (i) the Company's continued successful drilling<br /><br />
results in the Zhao Dong Block in the Bohai Bay in China, (ii)<br /><br />
the fact that top officials in China's oil industry have<br /><br />
indicated that the Company will be offered additional exploration<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
development rights in China and (iii) the<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
successful placement in May 1997 of $100 million of Preferred<br /><br />
Stock and Notes, the proceeds of which allowed the Company to<br /><br />
commence<br /><br />
achieving its objectives in China, the Company's<br /><br />
financial and operating goals for 1997 had been met and exceeded.<br /><br />
Company Performance and Chief Executive Officer Compensation<br /><br />
- -----------------------------------------------------------The<br /><br />
Committee,<br /><br />
in connection with determining<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
appropriate compensation for Marsden W. Miller, Jr. as Chief<br /><br />
Executive Officer ("CEO"), took into account the financial<br /><br />
condition of the Company, including its liquidity requirements.<br /><br />
It determined that the CEO had been successful in disposing of<br /><br />
assets and raising capital throughout the year. Taking into<br /><br />
consideration the performance of the CEO, as well as the<br /><br />
Company's current cash position and near term requirements, the<br /><br />
adoption of the 1997 LTSIP Restatement and the<br /><br />
NSO<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Appreciation Option awarded to the CEO under the 1997 LTSIP<br /><br />
Restatement, the Committee decided that the 1997 awards should<br /><br />
serve in lieu of a cash salary increase or bonus to the CEO for<br /><br />
the present time.<br /><br />
Compensation of Other Executive Officers<br /><br />
- ---------------------------------------The Committee, in consultation with the CEO, applied the<br /><br />
information and other factors outlined above in reviewing and<br /><br />
approving the compensation of the Company's other executive<br /><br />
officers.<br /><br />

DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING DEBT<br /><br />
General<br /><br />
- ------The Company's only outstanding long-term indebtedness is<br /><br />
represented by the Notes issued in connection with the Note<br /><br />
Offering concluded on May 20, 1997. The Notes are limited in<br /><br />
aggregate principal amount to $75 million. The Notes represent<br /><br />
senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of<br /><br />
payment with all indebtedness of the Company and senior to any<br /><br />
indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Notes are secured by (i) a pledge of all the capital stock of XCLChina and any other future restricted subsidiary and (ii) the<br /><br />
subsidiary guarantees of XCL-China (which has given a full and<br /><br />
unconditional guaranty) and any other Subsidiary Guarantor.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Notes will mature on May 1, 2004. The Notes bear interest at the<br /><br />
rate of 13.50% per annum, payable semiannually on May 1 and<br /><br />
November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 1997.<br /><br />
The Notes were issued pursuant to the terms of the Indenture<br /><br />
with Fleet National Bank as the original Trustee. The Trustee is<br /><br />
now State Street Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut N.A. The<br /><br />
terms of the Indenture are also governed by certain provisions<br /><br />
contained in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Indenture contains customary representations and warranties by<br /><br />
the Company as well as certain affirmative and negative covenants<br /><br />
briefly described elsewhere in this Prospectus.<br /><br />

property have been received from several parties and the Company<br /><br />
is presently evaluating such proposals with the possible intent<br /><br />
to sell the property.<br /><br />
The Company is also evaluating the<br /><br />
possibility of developing the property into a source of wetland<br /><br />
mitigation credits. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of<br /><br />

Special Charter and By-Law Provisions<br /><br />
- ------------------------------------General Effect.<br /><br />
The Board of Directors of the Company<br /><br />
believes that certain provisions in its Amended and Restated<br /><br />
Certificate<br /><br />
of Incorporation, as amended ("Certificate<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Incorporation") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of XCL (the<br /><br />
"By-Laws") will effectively reduce the possibility that a third<br /><br />
party could effect a sudden or surprise change of majority<br /><br />
control of the Company's Board of Directors or successfully<br /><br />
complete a takeover of XCL without the support of the incumbent<br /><br />
Board of Directors.<br /><br />
Certain provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and<br /><br />
By-Laws of XCL may have significant effects on the ability of the<br /><br />
stockholders of XCL to change the composition of the incumbent<br /><br />
Board of Directors and to benefit from certain transactions that<br /><br />
are opposed by the incumbent Board of Directors.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
XCL has adopted a number of provisions in its Certificate of<br /><br />
Incorporation and By-Laws that might discourage certain types of<br /><br />
transactions that involve an actual or threatened change of<br /><br />
control of XCL. The provisions may make it more difficult and<br /><br />
time consuming to change majority control of the Board of<br /><br />
Directors, and thus reduce the vulnerability of XCL to an<br /><br />
unsolicited offer to acquire XCL, particularly an offer that does<br /><br />
not contemplate the acquisition of all of XCL's outstanding<br /><br />
shares. As more fully described below, the Board believes that,<br /><br />
as a general rule, such unsolicited offers are not in the best<br /><br />
interests of XCL and its stockholders at this time.<br /><br />
The Board of Directors of XCL believes that the threat of<br /><br />
removal of XCL's management, in the case of a takeover bid,<br /><br />
severely curtails its ability to negotiate effectively with a<br /><br />
potential purchaser of XCL or its subsidiaries.<br /><br />
In such a<br /><br />
situation, management is deprived of the time and information<br /><br />
necessary to evaluate the takeover proposal, to study alternative<br /><br />
proposals, and to help ensure that the best transaction involving<br /><br />
XCL is ultimately undertaken. The Board believes a takeover of<br /><br />
XCL without prior negotiation with XCL's management would be<br /><br />
detrimental to XCL and its stockholders. Consequently, the Board<br /><br />
thinks that the benefits of protecting its ability to negotiate<br /><br />
with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to<br /><br />
take over or restructure XCL outweigh the disadvantages of<br /><br />
discouraging such proposals. The Certificate of Incorporation<br /><br />
makes it more difficult for a holder of a substantial block of<br /><br />
Common Stock to acquire control of, or to remove, the incumbent<br /><br />
Board and could thus have the effect of entrenching incumbent<br /><br />
management. At the same time, the anti-takeover provisions help<br /><br />
ensure that the Board, if confronted by a surprise proposal from<br /><br />
a third party who has recently acquired a block of Common Stock,<br /><br />
will have sufficient time to review the proposal and alternatives<br /><br />
to it and to seek better proposals for its stockholders,<br /><br />
employees, suppliers, customers, and others.<br /><br />
The anti-takeover provisions are intended to encourage<br /><br />
persons seeking to acquire control of XCL to initiate such an<br /><br />
acquisition<br /><br />
through<br /><br />
arm's-length negotiations<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
XCL's<br /><br />
management<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Board of Directors.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Certificate<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Incorporation could have the effect of discouraging a third party<br /><br />
from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain<br /><br />
control of XCL, even though such an attempt might be beneficial<br /><br />
to XCL and its stockholders.<br /><br />
Fair Price Provision. The purchaser in corporate takeovers<br /><br />
often pays cash to acquire a controlling equity interest in a<br /><br />
corporation and then arranges a transaction to acquire the<br /><br />
balance of the shares for a lower price or less desirable<br /><br />
consideration (frequently securities of the purchaser that do not<br /><br />
have an established trading market at the time of issue) or both.<br /><br />
This practice is known as "two-tier pricing" and tends (and may<br /><br />
be designed) to cause stockholders to accept the initial offer<br /><br />
for fear of becoming minority stockholders in a controlled<br /><br />
corporation or being forced to accept a lower price or less<br /><br />
favorable consideration for their shares.<br /><br />
To alleviate this<br /><br />
problem, XCL has included in its Certificate of Incorporation a<br /><br />
provision (the "Fair Price Provision") designed to assure that<br /><br />
all stockholders of XCL will receive substantially the same price<br /><br />
for their shares in transactions in which XCL is acquired in two<br /><br />
or more steps.<br /><br />
The Fair Price Provision discourages two-step acquisitions<br /><br />
of XCL by requiring that mergers and certain other business<br /><br />
combinations involving XCL and any Interested Stockholder (as<br /><br />
hereinafter defined) either (1) meet certain minimum price and<br /><br />
procedural requirements, (2) be approved by a majority of the<br /><br />
members of XCL's Board of Directors who are unaffiliated with the<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder and who were directors before<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Interested Stockholder became a 20% stockholder, (3) be approved<br /><br />
by the favorable vote of at least 67% of the voting power of the<br /><br />
Voting Stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting<br /><br />
Stock (as hereinafter defined) held by persons who are neither<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholders<br /><br />
nor<br /><br />
affiliates<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholders, or (4) be approved by the holders of at least 80%<br /><br />
of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock.<br /><br />
from<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Fair Price Provision is designed to prevent a purchaser<br /><br />
utilizing two-tier pricing and similar tactics in an<br /><br />
<br /><br />
attempted takeover of XCL. It has the overall effect of making<br /><br />
it more difficult to acquire and exercise control of XCL and may<br /><br />
provide officers and directors with enhanced ability to retain<br /><br />
their position in the event of a takeover bid.<br /><br />
It is not<br /><br />
designed to prevent or discourage all tender offers for control<br /><br />
of XCL.<br /><br />
The Fair Price Provision does not preclude an offeror<br /><br />
from making a tender offer for some of the shares of XCL's stock<br /><br />
without proposing a Business Combination (as defined below) in<br /><br />
which the remaining shares of stock are purchased. Except for<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
restrictions on Business Combinations, the Fair Price<br /><br />
Provision will not prevent a holder of a controlling interest of<br /><br />
the XCL Common Stock from exercising control over XCL or<br /><br />
increasing its interest in XCL. The Board will support or oppose<br /><br />
any future takeover proposal, whether or not the proposal<br /><br />
satisfies the fair price requirements for the Fair<br /><br />
Price<br /><br />
Provision, if the Board determines that its support or opposition<br /><br />
is in the best interests of XCL's stockholders.<br /><br />
The Fair Price Provision will not limit the ability of a<br /><br />
third party to effect a Business Combination, as long as such<br /><br />
third party owns (or can obtain the affirmative votes of) at<br /><br />
least 80% of the outstanding shares of all classes of capital<br /><br />
stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors<br /><br />
(the "Voting Stock").<br /><br />
Certain Definitions Used in the Fair Price Provision.<br /><br />
An<br /><br />
"Interested Stockholder" is defined in the Fair Price Provision<br /><br />
as anyone who is the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the<br /><br />
Voting Stock, and includes any person who, in a transaction not<br /><br />
involving a public offering, is an assignee of or has succeeded<br /><br />
to any shares of Voting Stock of XCL that were at any time within<br /><br />
the prior two-year period beneficially owned by an Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder.<br /><br />
The term "beneficial owner" includes<br /><br />
persons<br /><br />
directly and indirectly owning or having the right to acquire or<br /><br />
vote the stock. The Board of Directors of XCL considers that a<br /><br />
20%<br /><br />
holding,<br /><br />
which is four times the minimum<br /><br />
ownership<br /><br />
requirement<br /><br />
imposed in connection with<br /><br />
various<br /><br />
reporting<br /><br />
requirements under the Exchange Act for stockholders of public<br /><br />
companies, is appropriate to define an Interested Stockholder.<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
"Business<br /><br />
Combination"<br /><br />
includes<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
following<br /><br />
transactions: (1) a merger or consolidation of XCL or any<br /><br />
subsidiary with an Interested Stockholder or with any other<br /><br />
company or entity that is, or after such merger or consolidation<br /><br />
would be, an affiliate of an Interested Stockholder; (2) the sale<br /><br />
or other disposition by XCL or a subsidiary of assets having an<br /><br />
aggregate fair market value equal to 10% or more of the net<br /><br />
assets of XCL or more if an Interested Stockholder (or an<br /><br />
affiliate thereof) is a party to the transaction; (3) the<br /><br />
issuance or transfer of stock or other securities of XCL or of a<br /><br />
subsidiary to a person or entity that, immediately before such<br /><br />
issuance, is an Interested Stockholder (or an affiliate thereof)<br /><br />
in exchange for cash or property (including stock or other<br /><br />
securities) having an aggregate fair market value equal to 10% or<br /><br />
more of the net assets of XCL; (4) the adoption of any plan or<br /><br />
proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of XCL proposed by or<br /><br />
on behalf of an Interested Stockholder (or an affiliate thereof);<br /><br />
or (5) any reclassification of securities, recapitalization,<br /><br />
merger with a subsidiary or other transaction that has the<br /><br />
effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate<br /><br />
share of the outstanding stock (or securities convertible into<br /><br />
stock) of any class of XCL or any of its subsidiaries owned by an<br /><br />
Interested Stockholder or affiliate.<br /><br />
A "Disinterested Director" is a member of the Board of<br /><br />
Directors of XCL who is not affiliated with or a nominee of an<br /><br />
Interested Stockholder and was a director of XCL immediately<br /><br />
before the time the Interested Stockholder became an Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder, and any successor to such Disinterested Director who<br /><br />
is not affiliated with or a nominee of an Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
and was recommended for nomination or election to the Board by a<br /><br />
majority of the Disinterested Directors then on the Board.<br /><br />
Requirements for Certain Business Combinations Without the<br /><br />
Fair Price Provision. If XCL's Certificate of Incorporation did<br /><br />
not include the Fair Price Provision, mergers, consolidations,<br /><br />
the sale of substantially all of the assets of XCL, the adoption<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
a plan of dissolution of XCL and reclassification of<br /><br />
securities and recapitalizations of XCL involving amendments to<br /><br />
the Certificate of Incorporation would require approval by the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
holders of a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock.<br /><br />
Certain<br /><br />
other transactions, such as sales of<br /><br />
less<br /><br />
than<br /><br />
substantially all of the assets of XCL, certain mergers involving<br /><br />
a wholly owned subsidiary of XCL and recapitalizations and<br /><br />
reclassifications not involving amendments to the Certificate of<br /><br />
Incorporation would not require stockholder approval.<br /><br />
Requirements for Certain Business Combinations Under the<br /><br />
Fair Price Provision. Under the Fair Price Provision, it will be<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
condition to a Business Combination with an Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder that the transaction either (1) meet certain price<br /><br />
criteria and procedural requirements (discussed below), or (2) be<br /><br />
approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, or (3) be<br /><br />
approved by the favorable vote of at least 67% of the voting<br /><br />
power of the Voting Stock and a majority of the outstanding<br /><br />
shares of Voting Stock held by persons who are neither Interested<br /><br />
Stockholders or affiliates of Interested Stockholders, or (4) be<br /><br />
approved by the favorable vote of at least 80% of the voting<br /><br />
power of the Voting Stock. If the minimum price criteria and<br /><br />
procedural requirements are met or the requisite approval of the<br /><br />
Disinterested Directors is obtained with respect to a particular<br /><br />
Business Combination, then the normal requirements of Delaware<br /><br />
law will apply, and only a majority vote of the outstanding<br /><br />
Voting Stock will be required or, for certain transactions as<br /><br />
noted above, no stockholder vote will be necessary.<br /><br />
If the<br /><br />
minimum price criteria and procedural requirements are not met or<br /><br />
the requisite approval of the Disinterested Directors is not<br /><br />
obtained, or the requisite vote of shareholders not affiliated<br /><br />
with the Interested Stockholder is not obtained, then a Business<br /><br />
Combination with an Interested Stockholder will require an 80%<br /><br />
stockholder vote. One consequence of the Fair Price Provision,<br /><br />
therefore, is that additional time and expense would be required<br /><br />
to effect certain Business Combinations due to the need to hold a<br /><br />
special stockholders' meeting.<br /><br />
Exceptions to Higher Vote Requirements under the Fair Price<br /><br />
Provision. The 80% affirmative stockholder vote contemplated by<br /><br />
the Fair Price Provision will be required only if (1) the minimum<br /><br />
price criteria and procedural requirements described under (a)<br /><br />
and (b) below are not satisfied or (2) the transaction is not<br /><br />
approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors or (3) the<br /><br />
requisite vote of shareholders not affiliated with the Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder is not obtained.<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
Minimum Price Criteria. In a Business Combination<br /><br />
involving cash or other consideration paid to XCL's stockholders,<br /><br />
the consideration must be either cash or the same type of<br /><br />
consideration used by the Interested Stockholder in acquiring the<br /><br />
largest portion of its Voting Stock before the first public<br /><br />
announcement of the terms of the proposed Business Combination<br /><br />
(the "Announcement Date"). In addition, the fair market value<br /><br />
(calculated in accordance with the Fair Price Provision) of the<br /><br />
consideration to be paid on the date the Business Combination was<br /><br />
consummated (the "Consummation Date") must meet certain minimum<br /><br />
price criteria described herein.<br /><br />
In the case of payments to holders of Common Stock and<br /><br />
Preferred Stock, the fair market value per share of such payments<br /><br />
must be at least equal in value to the higher of (1) the highest<br /><br />
price per share (including brokerage commissions, transfer taxes<br /><br />
and soliciting dealers' fees) paid by the Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
in acquiring any shares of such class or series of stock during<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
two years before the Announcement Date (even if the<br /><br />
Interested Stockholder was not an Interested Stockholder at the<br /><br />
time of any such acquisitions) or in the transaction in which it<br /><br />
became an Interested Stockholder (whichever is higher), or (2)<br /><br />
the fair market value per share of such class or series of stock<br /><br />
on the Announcement Date or on the date on which the Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder became an Interested Stockholder (the "Determination<br /><br />
Date"), whichever is higher; provided, however, the holders of<br /><br />
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount at least<br /><br />
equal<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
highest preferential amount<br /><br />
payable<br /><br />
upon<br /><br />
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of XCL applicable thereto<br /><br />
if the Interested Stockholder has not previously purchased shares<br /><br />
of Preferred Stock or such price paid for Preferred Stock is<br /><br />
lower<br /><br />
than<br /><br />
such preferential amount.<br /><br />
If the<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder purchased any shares of Common Stock during the twoyear period before the Announcement Date, the minimum price might<br /><br />
be fixed based on a purchase occurring as long as two years<br /><br />
before the Announcement Date. If the Determination Date was more<br /><br />
<br /><br />
than two years before the Announcement Date, then the minimum<br /><br />
price could be set as of such earlier date. If the Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder did not purchase any shares of Common Stock during<br /><br />
the two-year period before the Announcement Date or in the<br /><br />
transaction on the Determination Date in which it became an<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder (e.g., if it became an<br /><br />
Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder through the acquisition of shares of another class of<br /><br />
Voting Stock), the minimum price would be as determined under (2)<br /><br />
above.<br /><br />
For example, if the acquisition by an Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
of its Common Stock interest was by cash purchases in open market<br /><br />
transactions and the highest price paid per share of Common Stock<br /><br />
during the previous two years (including in the transaction in<br /><br />
which it became an Interested Stockholder) was $5.00, and<br /><br />
assuming that the fair market values per share of Common Stock on<br /><br />
the Determination Date and on the Announcement Date were $4.00<br /><br />
and $4.50, respectively, the amount required to be paid to the<br /><br />
holders of Common Stock would be the amount per share in cash<br /><br />
equal to the higher of (1) $5.00 (the highest price paid), and<br /><br />
(2)<br /><br />
$4.50 (fair market value on the Announcement<br /><br />
Date).<br /><br />
Accordingly, in order to comply with the Fair Price Provision's<br /><br />
minimum price criteria, the Interested Stockholder would be<br /><br />
required to pay at least $5.00 per share in cash to holders of<br /><br />
Common Stock in the Business Combination. If the Interested<br /><br />
Stockholder did not purchase any shares of Common Stock during<br /><br />
the two-year period before becoming an Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
(e.g., if it became an Interested Stockholder through the<br /><br />
acquisition of shares of another class of Voting Stock), the<br /><br />
minimum price payable under the Fair Price Provision for shares<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Common Stock would be the fair market value on<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Announcement Date or on the Determination Date, whichever is<br /><br />
higher, resulting in a price, in the foregoing example, of $4.50<br /><br />
per share in cash. All such prices shall be subject to an<br /><br />
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock<br /><br />
split, subdivision, combination of shares or similar event.<br /><br />
In the case of payments to holders of any class or series of<br /><br />
XCL's Voting Stock other than Common Stock, the fair market value<br /><br />
per share of such payments must be at least equal to the higher<br /><br />
of (a) the highest price per share determined with respect to<br /><br />
such class or series of stock in the same manner as described in<br /><br />
clauses (1) and (2) of the preceding paragraphs, or (b) the<br /><br />
highest preferential amount per share to which the holders of<br /><br />
such class or series of Voting Stock are entitled in the event of<br /><br />
a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of XCL.<br /><br />
Under the minimum price requirements, the fair market value<br /><br />
of non-cash consideration to be received by holders of shares of<br /><br />
any class of Voting Stock in a Business Combination is to be<br /><br />
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of XCL.<br /><br />
Under the Fair Price Provision, the Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
is required to meet the minimum price with respect to each class<br /><br />
of stock before proposing the Business Combination.<br /><br />
If the<br /><br />
minimum price criteria and the procedural requirements (discussed<br /><br />
below) are not met with respect to each class of Voting Stock,<br /><br />
then an 80% vote of stockholders will be required to approve the<br /><br />
Business Combination unless the transaction is approved by the<br /><br />
favorable vote of at least 67% of the voting power of the Voting<br /><br />
Stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock<br /><br />
held by persons who are neither Interested Stockholders nor<br /><br />
affiliates of Interested Stockholders, or by a majority of the<br /><br />
Disinterested Directors.<br /><br />
If the proposed Business Combination does not involve<br /><br />
receipt by the other stockholders of XCL of cash or other<br /><br />
property, such as a sale of assets or an issuance of XCL's<br /><br />
securities to an Interested Stockholder, then the price criteria<br /><br />
discussed above will not apply and an 80% vote of stockholders<br /><br />
will be required unless the transaction is approved by the<br /><br />
favorable vote of at least 67% of the voting power of the Voting<br /><br />
Stock and a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock<br /><br />
held by persons who are neither Interested Stockholders nor<br /><br />
affiliates of Interested Stockholders, or by a majority of the<br /><br />
Disinterested Directors.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Procedural Requirements. Under the Fair Price<br /><br />
Provision, unless the Business Combination is approved by a<br /><br />
majority of the Disinterested Directors, the Business Combination<br /><br />
<br /><br />
will be subject to the 80% stockholder vote requirement, even if<br /><br />
it satisfies the minimum price criteria, in each of the following<br /><br />
situations:<br /><br />
(1)<br /><br />
If XCL, after the Interested Stockholder became<br /><br />
an Interested Stockholder, (i) reduced the rate of dividends<br /><br />
paid on the Common Stock (unless such reduction<br /><br />
was<br /><br />
necessary to reflect any subdivision of the Common Stock),<br /><br />
or (ii) failed to increase the rate of dividends as<br /><br />
necessary to reflect any reclassification (including any<br /><br />
reverse stock split), recapitalization, reorganization or<br /><br />
any similar transaction which has the effect of reducing the<br /><br />
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, unless such<br /><br />
reduction was approved by a majority of the Disinterested<br /><br />
Directors.<br /><br />
This provision is designed to prevent<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
Interested Stockholder from attempting to depress the market<br /><br />
price of the Common Stock before proposing a Business<br /><br />
Combination by reducing dividends on the Common Stock, and<br /><br />
thereby reducing the consideration required to be paid<br /><br />
pursuant to the minimum price provisions of the Fair Price<br /><br />
Provision.<br /><br />
(2)<br /><br />
If the Interested Stockholder acquired any<br /><br />
additional shares of Voting Stock except in the transaction<br /><br />
pursuant to which it became an Interested Stockholder. This<br /><br />
provision is intended to prevent an Interested Stockholder<br /><br />
from purchasing additional shares of Voting Stock without<br /><br />
compliance with the provisions of the Fair Price Provision.<br /><br />
(3)<br /><br />
If the Interested Stockholder, at any time<br /><br />
after it became an Interested Stockholder, whether in<br /><br />
connection<br /><br />
with the proposed Business Combination<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
otherwise, received the benefits of any loss or other<br /><br />
financial assistance or tax advantage provided by XCL (other<br /><br />
than proportionately as a stockholder). This provision is<br /><br />
intended to deter an Interested Stockholder from selfdealing or otherwise taking advantage of its equity position<br /><br />
in XCL by using XCL's resources to finance the proposed<br /><br />
Business Combination or otherwise for its own purposes in a<br /><br />
manner not proportionately available to all stockholders.<br /><br />
Under the Fair Price Provision, unless the Business<br /><br />
Combination is approved by a majority of the Disinterested<br /><br />
Directors, to avoid the 80% stockholder vote requirement even if<br /><br />
the other conditions described above are met, a proxy or<br /><br />
information statement disclosing the terms and conditions of the<br /><br />
proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements<br /><br />
of the proxy rules promulgated under the Exchange Act will have<br /><br />
to be mailed to all stockholders of XCL at least 30 days before<br /><br />
the consummation of a Business Combination. This provision is<br /><br />
intended to ensure that XCL's stockholders will be fully informed<br /><br />
of the terms and conditions of the proposed Business Combination<br /><br />
even if the Interested Stockholder is not otherwise legally<br /><br />
required to disclose such information to stockholders.<br /><br />
NONE OF THE MINIMUM PRICE OR PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />
DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL APPLY IN THE CASE OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION<br /><br />
APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF THE DISINTERESTED DIRECTORS OR THE<br /><br />
FAVORABLE VOTE OF 67% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES AND A MAJORITY OF<br /><br />
THE SHARES HELD BY PERSONS WHO ARE NEITHER THE INTERESTED<br /><br />
STOCKHOLDER NOR AFFILIATES OF THE INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER, AND, IN<br /><br />
THE ABSENCE OF SUCH APPROVAL, ALL OF SUCH REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE<br /><br />
TO BE SATISFIED TO AVOID THE 80% STOCKHOLDER VOTE REQUIREMENT.<br /><br />
Classified Board. XCL's Board of Directors is divided into<br /><br />
three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms,<br /><br />
with one class of directors to be elected at each annual meeting<br /><br />
of shareholders to hold office until the end of their term or<br /><br />
until their successors have been elected and qualified. Directors<br /><br />
may not be removed without cause except upon the affirmative vote<br /><br />
of the holders of 67% of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock.<br /><br />
This provision makes it more difficult to effect an involuntary<br /><br />
change in incumbent management.<br /><br />
No<br /><br />
Cumulative<br /><br />
Voting.<br /><br />
Neither the Certificate<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Incorporation nor the By-Laws permit cumulative voting. Thus, a<br /><br />
purchaser of a block of Common Stock representing less than a<br /><br />
majority of the outstanding shares will have no assurance of<br /><br />
proportional representation on the Board of Directors.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Action by Stockholder Consent. Delaware law provides<br /><br />
that, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation denies<br /><br />
the right, stockholders may act by a written consent executed by<br /><br />
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of voting<br /><br />
stock<br /><br />
without<br /><br />
holding a special or<br /><br />
annual<br /><br />
meeting<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation prohibits action<br /><br />
that is required or permitted to be taken at any annual or<br /><br />
special meeting of stockholders of XCL from being taken by the<br /><br />
written<br /><br />
consent of stockholders without a meeting<br /><br />
unless<br /><br />
authorized by a majority of the Disinterested Directors.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
intent of this provision is to provide an open forum at a<br /><br />
stockholders' meeting for all stockholders to have a chance to<br /><br />
attend and be heard. This provision could have an anti-takeover<br /><br />
effect and tend to entrench management by forcing the holder or<br /><br />
holders of a majority of the outstanding stock to exercise their<br /><br />
prerogatives of majority ownership only by<br /><br />
voting<br /><br />
at<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
stockholders' meeting rather than by written consent.<br /><br />
Supermajority Voting.<br /><br />
The Fair Price Provision may be<br /><br />
altered, amended, or repealed only if the holders of 80% or more<br /><br />
of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock entitled to vote<br /><br />
thereon or 67% or more of the outstanding shares voting together<br /><br />
with a majority of the outstanding shares held by persons other<br /><br />
than the Interested Stockholder and its affiliates, vote in favor<br /><br />
of such action. The other anti-takeover provisions and certain<br /><br />
other provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation may be<br /><br />
altered, changed, amended, or repealed only if the holders of 67%<br /><br />
or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of XCL entitled<br /><br />
to vote thereon vote in favor of such action.<br /><br />
Without this<br /><br />
supermajority voting, the beneficial effects of the provisions<br /><br />
requiring such greater percentage of vote could be nullified by<br /><br />
subsequent amendments approved by a vote of the holders of only a<br /><br />
majority of Common Stock.<br /><br />
Preferred Stock<br /><br />
--------------General<br /><br />
- ------Under the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of<br /><br />
Directors of XCL may direct the issuance of up to 2,400,000<br /><br />
shares of Preferred Stock, in one or more series and with rights,<br /><br />
preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including, without<br /><br />
limitation, dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights,<br /><br />
terms of redemption, and liquidation preferences, that may be<br /><br />
fixed or designated by the Board of Directors without any further<br /><br />
vote or action by XCL's stockholders. The following description<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Preferred Stock sets forth certain general terms<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
provisions of the two series of Preferred Stock which are<br /><br />
currently issued and outstanding. As discussed elsewhere in this<br /><br />
Prospectus, effective November 10, 1997, the Company amended,<br /><br />
recapitalized and combined the outstanding shares of Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock into shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock which, together with the Amended<br /><br />
Series<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock issued in the Equity Offering,<br /><br />
constituted a single class of approximately $93 million (in<br /><br />
aggregate liquidation preference) of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock at that time. The shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
currently outstanding have an aggregate<br /><br />
liquidation<br /><br />
preference of approximately $101 million. Effective January 16,<br /><br />
1997, the Series F Preferred Stock was mandatorily converted into<br /><br />
633,893 shares of Common Stock. On March 3, 1998, the Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock was sold by the holder thereof, and<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
purchasers exchanged the shares of Series B Preferred Stock for<br /><br />
an aggregate 44,465 shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
In addition, such purchasers were issued an additional 2,620<br /><br />
shares (in the aggregate) of Amended Series B Preferred Stock in<br /><br />
payment of accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
The shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock currently<br /><br />
outstanding<br /><br />
have<br /><br />
an aggregate liquidation<br /><br />
preference<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
approximately $4.8 million. The description of Preferred Stock<br /><br />
set forth below and the description of the terms of a particular<br /><br />
series of Preferred Stock do not purport to be complete and are<br /><br />
qualified in their entirety by reference to the Certificate of<br /><br />
Incorporation and the certificate of designation relating to that<br /><br />
series.<br /><br />
The rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the<br /><br />
Preferred Stock of each series shall be as stated in the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Certificate of Incorporation and, to the extent not stated<br /><br />
therein, may be fixed by the certificate of designation relating<br /><br />
to such series, which shall specify the terms of the Preferred<br /><br />
Stock as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
the maximum number of shares to constitute the<br /><br />
series and the distinctive designations thereof;<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
the annual dividend rate, if any, on shares of<br /><br />
the series and the date or dates from which dividends shall<br /><br />
commence to accrue or accumulate, and whether dividends<br /><br />
shall be cumulative;<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
the price at and the terms and conditions on<br /><br />
which the shares of the series may be redeemed, including<br /><br />
the time during which shares of the series may be redeemed,<br /><br />
the premium, if any, over and above the par value thereof,<br /><br />
and any accumulated dividends thereon that the holders of<br /><br />
shares of the series shall be entitled to receive upon the<br /><br />
redemption thereof, which premium may vary at different<br /><br />
dates and may also be different with respect to shares<br /><br />
redeemed through the operation of any retirement or sinking<br /><br />
fund;<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
the liquidation preference, if any, over and<br /><br />
above the par value thereof, and any accumulated dividends<br /><br />
thereon, that the holders of shares of the series shall be<br /><br />
entitled to receive upon the voluntary or involuntary<br /><br />
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the affairs of<br /><br />
XCL;<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
whether or not the shares of the series shall<br /><br />
be subject to operation of a retirement or sinking fund,<br /><br />
and, if so, the extent and manner in which any such<br /><br />
retirement or sinking fund shall be applied to the purchase<br /><br />
or redemption of the shares of the series for retirement or<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
other corporate purposes, and the terms and provisions<br /><br />
relative to the operations of such retirement or sinking<br /><br />
fund;<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
the terms and conditions, if any, on which the<br /><br />
shares<br /><br />
of the series shall be convertible into,<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of<br /><br />
capital stock of XCL or any series of any other class or<br /><br />
classes, or of any other series of the same class, including<br /><br />
the price or prices or the rate or rates of conversion or<br /><br />
exchange and the method, if any, of adjusting the same,<br /><br />
provided that shares of such series may not be convertible<br /><br />
into shares of a series or class that has prior or superior<br /><br />
rights and preferences as to dividends or distribution of<br /><br />
assets of XCL upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution or<br /><br />
winding up of the affairs of XCL;<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
series; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the voting rights, if any, on the shares of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(h)<br /><br />
any or all other preferences and relative,<br /><br />
participating, optional, or other special<br /><br />
rights,<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof.<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
- -------------------------------On May 20, 1997, the Company issued 294,118 shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Equity<br /><br />
Offering. In subsequent transactions through September 30, 1998,<br /><br />
the Company has issued an additional 887,507 shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock including shares issued in payment of<br /><br />
dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Dividend Rights<br /><br />
--------------Holders of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock are entitled<br /><br />
to receive when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors,<br /><br />
out of the funds of the Company legally available therefor, an<br /><br />
annual dividend of $8.075 per share, payable semi-annually on May<br /><br />
1 and November 1 in each year, commencing November 1, 1997.<br /><br />
Dividends are payable in additional shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock (valued at $85.00 per share) through November 1,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2000, and thereafter in cash, or at the Company's election, in<br /><br />
shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock (valued at $85.00 per<br /><br />
share). Dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock are<br /><br />
cumulative from May 20, 1997, and will be payable, when, as and<br /><br />
if declared, to holders of record on the applicable record date<br /><br />
as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. Dividends in arrears<br /><br />
may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any<br /><br />
regular dividend payment date, to holders of record on such date<br /><br />
not exceeding 60 days preceding the payment date thereof, as may<br /><br />
be fixed by the Board of Directors. Accrued but unpaid dividends<br /><br />
will not bear interest. Dividends payable for any partial semiannual period will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year<br /><br />
consisting of twelve 30-day months.<br /><br />
If dividends are not paid in full on all outstanding shares<br /><br />
of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock and any other capital<br /><br />
stock of the Company ranking on a parity with the Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock as to dividends, all dividends declared on the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock and such other parity stock may<br /><br />
only be declared and paid pro rata so that in all cases the<br /><br />
amount of dividends declared per share on the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and such other parity stock will bear to each<br /><br />
other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share<br /><br />
on the shares of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock and such<br /><br />
other parity stock bear to each other. So long as they are<br /><br />
outstanding, the Company's existing shares of Series B Preferred<br /><br />
Stock shall rank on a parity with the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution and<br /><br />
winding up. Unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding<br /><br />
shares of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock have been paid, no<br /><br />
dividends (other than in Common Stock or other stock ranking<br /><br />
junior to the Amended Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends<br /><br />
and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) may be paid,<br /><br />
declared or set aside for payment, or any other distributions<br /><br />
made on the Common Stock or on any other stock of the Company<br /><br />
ranking junior to the Amended Series A Preferred Stock as to<br /><br />
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, nor may<br /><br />
any Common Stock or any other stock of the Company ranking junior<br /><br />
to or on a parity with the Amended Series A Preferred Stock be<br /><br />
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration<br /><br />
by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for stock<br /><br />
of the Company ranking junior to the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or<br /><br />
winding up).<br /><br />
Under Delaware law, the Company may declare and pay<br /><br />
dividends or make other distributions on its capital stock only<br /><br />
out of surplus, as defined in the Delaware General Corporation<br /><br />
Law (the "DGCL"). On June 30, 1998, the Company had available<br /><br />
surplus of approximately $48 million. The payment of dividends<br /><br />
and any future operating losses will reduce such surplus of the<br /><br />
Company, which may adversely affect the ability of the Company to<br /><br />
continue to pay dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock. In addition, no dividends or distributions may<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
declared, paid or made if the Company is or would be rendered<br /><br />
insolvent by virtue of such dividend or distribution, and the<br /><br />
Indenture limits the Company's ability to pay cash dividends. See<br /><br />
"Dividend Policy."<br /><br />
Conversion Rights<br /><br />
----------------The holder of any shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
will have the right, at the holder's option, to convert any or<br /><br />
all of such shares into Common Stock at any time after the<br /><br />
Initial Conversion Date at a conversion price ("Conversion<br /><br />
Price") of, initially, $0.50 per share (subject to adjustment as<br /><br />
described below), or an initial effective conversion<br /><br />
rate<br /><br />
("Conversion Rate") of 170 shares of Common Stock for each share<br /><br />
of Amended Series A Preferred Stock (subject to adjustment as<br /><br />
described below), except that if the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock is called for redemption, the conversion right will<br /><br />
terminate as to the shares called for redemption at 5:00 p.m.,<br /><br />
New York City time, on the business day prior to the date fixed<br /><br />
for such redemption. Except as provided in the next paragraph,<br /><br />
no payments or adjustments in respect of dividends on shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion,<br /><br />
whether paid or unpaid and whether or not in arrears, or on<br /><br />
account of any dividend on the Conversion Stock issued upon<br /><br />
conversion, shall be made by the Company upon the conversion of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock, at the option of<br /><br />
the holder, including any conversion described under "-- Special<br /><br />
Conversion Rights" below. The holder of record of shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock on a dividend record date who<br /><br />
surrenders such shares for conversion during the period between<br /><br />
such dividend record date and the corresponding dividend payment<br /><br />
date will be entitled to receive the dividend on such dividend<br /><br />
payment date notwithstanding the conversion of such shares;<br /><br />
provided, however, that, unless such shares, prior to such<br /><br />
surrender, had been called for redemption on a redemption date<br /><br />
during the period between such dividend record date and such<br /><br />
dividend payment date, such shares must be accompanied, upon<br /><br />
surrender for conversion, by payment from the holder to the<br /><br />
Company of an amount equal to the dividend payable on such shares<br /><br />
on that dividend payment date. No fractional shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock will be issued upon conversion but, in lieu thereof, an<br /><br />
appropriate amount will be paid in cash based on the Market Price<br /><br />
(as defined below) for the shares of Common Stock on the day of<br /><br />
such conversion. No adjustment in the Conversion Price will be<br /><br />
required unless such adjustment would require an increase or<br /><br />
decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Price;<br /><br />
provided, however, that any adjustment which is not made will be<br /><br />
carried<br /><br />
forward and taken into account in any subsequent<br /><br />
adjustment.<br /><br />
If the Company, by dividend or otherwise, declares or makes<br /><br />
a distribution on its Common Stock referred to in clause (d) or<br /><br />
(e) of the next paragraph, the holders of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock, upon the conversion thereof subsequent to the<br /><br />
close of business on the date fixed for the determination of<br /><br />
stockholders entitled to receive such distribution and prior to<br /><br />
the effectiveness of the Conversion Price adjustment in respect<br /><br />
of such distribution, will be entitled to receive for each share<br /><br />
of Common Stock into which Amended Series A Preferred Stock is so<br /><br />
converted the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of<br /><br />
capital stock, cash and assets so distributed applicable to one<br /><br />
share of Common Stock; provided, however, that the Company may,<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
respect to all holders so converting, in<br /><br />
lieu<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
distributing any portion of such distribution not consisting of<br /><br />
cash or securities of the Company, pay such holder cash equal to<br /><br />
the fair market value thereof (as determined by the Board of<br /><br />
Directors).<br /><br />
The Conversion Price and the Conversion Rate will be subject<br /><br />
to adjustment in certain events including, without duplication,<br /><br />
(a) dividends (and other distributions) payable in Common Stock<br /><br />
to all holders of Common Stock; (b) the issuance to all holders<br /><br />
of Common Stock of rights or warrants, entitling holders of such<br /><br />
rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at<br /><br />
less than the current Market Price; (c) subdivisions<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
combinations of Common Stock; (d) distributions to all holders of<br /><br />
Common Stock of evidences of indebtedness of the Company, shares<br /><br />
of capital stock, cash or assets (including securities, but<br /><br />
excluding those rights, warrants, dividends and distributions<br /><br />
referred<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
above<br /><br />
and dividends and distributions<br /><br />
paid<br /><br />
exclusively in cash); and (e) distributions to all holders of<br /><br />
Common Stock consisting of cash, but excluding (i) cash that is<br /><br />
part of a distribution referred to in (d) above and (ii) any<br /><br />
quarterly cash dividend to the extent it does not exceed the<br /><br />
amount per share of Common Stock of the next preceding quarterly<br /><br />
cash dividend (as adjusted to reflect any of the events referred<br /><br />
to in clauses (a) through (d) of this sentence), or all of any<br /><br />
such quarterly cash dividend if the amount thereof per share of<br /><br />
Common Stock multiplied by four does not exceed 15% of the<br /><br />
current Market Price of the Common Stock on the trading day next<br /><br />
preceding the date of declaration of such dividend. As a result<br /><br />
of the Reverse Stock Split, effective December 17, 1997 the<br /><br />
initial Conversion Price and the initial Conversion Rate were<br /><br />
adjusted to $7.50 and 11.333 shares, respectively.<br /><br />
The Company from time to time may voluntarily reduce the<br /><br />
Conversion Price (or increase the Conversion Rate) by any amount<br /><br />
for any period of at least 20 days, in which case the Company<br /><br />
will give at least 15 days' notice of such reduction (or<br /><br />
increase), if the Board of Directors of the Company has made a<br /><br />
determination that such reduction (or increase) would be in the<br /><br />
best interests of the Company, which determination will be<br /><br />
conclusive.<br /><br />
If the Company is party to any transaction pursuant to which<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Common Stock is converted into the right to receive other<br /><br />
securities, cash or other property, including by<br /><br />
way<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
recapitalization or reclassification (other than changes in par<br /><br />
value, subdivisions or combinations of outstanding shares),<br /><br />
consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of its<br /><br />
assets to, any person, then upon consummation of such transaction<br /><br />
the Amended Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible for the<br /><br />
kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and<br /><br />
property that the holder of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
would have owned immediately after any such transaction if the<br /><br />
holder had converted his shares immediately prior to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
effective<br /><br />
date thereof (which shares of stock and<br /><br />
other<br /><br />
securities and property may not necessarily be of equal value to<br /><br />
the Common Stock).<br /><br />
The term "Market Price" of the Common Stock for any day<br /><br />
means the last reported sale price, regular way, on such day, or,<br /><br />
if no sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported<br /><br />
closing bid and asked prices on such day, regular way, in either<br /><br />
case reported on the AMEX Consolidated Transaction Tape, or, if<br /><br />
the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on the AMEX<br /><br />
on such day, on the principal national securities exchange on<br /><br />
which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading, if the<br /><br />
Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, or the<br /><br />
National Market Tier of The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ NSM")<br /><br />
or, if not listed or admitted to trading on such quotation<br /><br />
system, on the principal quotation system on which the Common<br /><br />
Stock may be listed or admitted to trading or quoted or, if not<br /><br />
listed<br /><br />
or admitted to trading or quoted on any national<br /><br />
securities exchange or quotation system, the average of the<br /><br />
closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock in the over-thecounter market on the day in question as reported by the National<br /><br />
Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or similar generally accepted<br /><br />
reporting service, or, if not so available in such manner, as<br /><br />
furnished by any AMEX member firm selected from time to time by<br /><br />
the Board of Directors of the Company for that purpose or, if not<br /><br />
so available in such manner, as otherwise determined in good<br /><br />
faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.<br /><br />
Mandatory Conversion Rights<br /><br />
--------------------------The Amended Series A Preferred Stock may be converted, in<br /><br />
whole and not in part, at the election of the Company, at the<br /><br />
then prevailing Conversion Price at any time after November 20,<br /><br />
1997, provided that the Company is current in the payment of<br /><br />
dividends to the conversion date, that the Common Stock shall<br /><br />
have been traded on the AMEX or other national securities<br /><br />
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed or on the<br /><br />
Nasdaq NSM for 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading<br /><br />
day period at a Current Market Price (as defined below) equal to<br /><br />
or greater than 150% of the prevailing Conversion Price, subject<br /><br />
to adjustment in the same manner and for the same events as the<br /><br />
Conversion Price. The term "Current Market Price" of the Common<br /><br />
Stock for any day means the reported closing bid price, regular<br /><br />
way, on such day, as reported on the AMEX, or, if the Common<br /><br />
Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on the AMEX on such<br /><br />
day, on the principal national securities exchange on which the<br /><br />
Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading, if the Common<br /><br />
Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, or the NASDAQ<br /><br />
NSM or, if the Common Stock is not quoted or admitted to trading<br /><br />
on such quotations system, on the principal quotation system in<br /><br />
which the Common Stock may be listed or admitted to trading or<br /><br />
quoted or, if not listed or admitted to trading or quoted on any<br /><br />
national securities exchange or quotation system, the average of<br /><br />
the closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock in the overthe-counter market on the day in question as reported by the<br /><br />
National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or similar generally<br /><br />
accepted reporting service, or, if not so available in such<br /><br />
manner, as furnished by any AMEX member firm selected from time<br /><br />
to time by the Board of Directors of the Company for that purpose<br /><br />
or, if not so available in such manner, as otherwise determined<br /><br />
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, which<br /><br />
determination shall be conclusive.<br /><br />
Special Conversion Rights<br /><br />
------------------------The<br /><br />
conversion<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock has a special<br /><br />
right that becomes effective upon the occurrence of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
certain types of significant transactions affecting ownership or<br /><br />
control of the Company or the market for the Common Stock. The<br /><br />
purpose of the special conversion right is to provide (subject to<br /><br />
certain exceptions) loss protection upon the occurrence of a<br /><br />
Change in Control (as defined below) or a Fundamental Change (as<br /><br />
defined below) at a time when the Market Value (as defined below)<br /><br />
of the Common Stock is less than the then prevailing Conversion<br /><br />
Price. In such situations, the special conversion right would,<br /><br />
for a limited period, reduce the then prevailing Conversion Price<br /><br />
to the Market Value of the Common Stock.<br /><br />
The special conversion right is intended to provide loss<br /><br />
protection to investors in certain circumstances while not giving<br /><br />
holders a veto power over significant transactions affecting<br /><br />
ownership or control of the Company.<br /><br />
Although the special<br /><br />
conversion right may render more costly or otherwise inhibit<br /><br />
certain proposed transactions, its primary purpose is not to<br /><br />
inhibit or discourage takeovers or other business combinations.<br /><br />
Each holder of Amended Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled<br /><br />
to a special conversion right if a Change of Control or<br /><br />
Fundamental Change occurs. A Change of Control will occur if a<br /><br />
person or group acquires more than 50% of the Common Stock. A<br /><br />
Fundamental Change is, generally, a sale of all or substantially<br /><br />
all of the Company's assets or a transaction in which at least<br /><br />
66% of the Common Stock is transferred for, or is converted into,<br /><br />
any other assets. However, if the majority of the value of the<br /><br />
consideration received in a transaction by holders of Common<br /><br />
Stock is Marketable Stock or if the holders of Common Stock hold<br /><br />
a majority of the voting stock of the Company's successor, the<br /><br />
transaction will not be a Fundamental Change, and holders of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock will not have special conversion<br /><br />
rights as a result of such transaction. In addition, the special<br /><br />
conversion right arising upon a Change of Control shall only be<br /><br />
applicable with respect to the first Change of Control that<br /><br />
occurs after the first date of issuance of any shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock. The full definitions of the terms<br /><br />
"Change of Control" and "Fundamental Change" appear below.<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
<br /><br />
special conversion right will permit a holder of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock, at the holder's option during the 30day period described below, to convert all, but not less than<br /><br />
all, of the holders' Amended Series A Preferred Stock at a<br /><br />
Conversion Price equal to the Market Value of the Common Stock. A<br /><br />
holder exercising a special conversion right will receive Common<br /><br />
Stock if a Change of Control occurs and, if a Fundamental Change<br /><br />
occurs, will receive the same consideration received for the<br /><br />
number of shares of Common Stock into which the holder's Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock would have been convertible at the<br /><br />
Market Value of the Common Stock. In either case, however, the<br /><br />
Company or its successor may, at its option, elect to provide the<br /><br />
holder with cash equal to the Market Value of the number of<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock into which the holder's Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock is convertible.<br /><br />
The Company will mail to each registered holder of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock a notice setting forth details of any<br /><br />
special conversion right occasioned by a Change of Control or<br /><br />
Fundamental Change within 30 days after the event occurs. A<br /><br />
special conversion right may be exercised only within the 30-day<br /><br />
period after the notice is mailed and will expire at the end of<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
Exercise of a special conversion right<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
irrevocable, and all Amended Series A Preferred Stock tendered<br /><br />
for conversion will be converted at the end of the 30-day period<br /><br />
mentioned in the preceding sentence.<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock that is not converted<br /><br />
pursuant to a special conversion right will continue to be<br /><br />
convertible pursuant to the general conversion rights described<br /><br />
above.<br /><br />
The special conversion right is not intended to, and does<br /><br />
not, protect holders of Amended Series A Preferred Stock in all<br /><br />
circumstances that might affect ownership or control of the<br /><br />
Company or the market for the Common Stock, or otherwise<br /><br />
adversely affect the value of an investment in the Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock. The ability to control the Company may be<br /><br />
obtained by a person even if that person does not, as is required<br /><br />
to constitute a Change of Control, acquire a majority of the<br /><br />
Company's voting stock. The Company and the market for the Common<br /><br />
Stock may be affected by various transactions that do not<br /><br />
<br /><br />
constitute a Fundamental Change. In particular, transactions<br /><br />
involving transfer or conversion of less than 66% of the Common<br /><br />
Stock may have a significant effect on the Company and the market<br /><br />
for the Common Stock, as could transactions in which holders of<br /><br />
Common Stock receive primarily Marketable Stock or continue to<br /><br />
own a majority of the voting securities of the successor to the<br /><br />
Company. In addition, if the special conversion right arises as<br /><br />
the result of a Fundamental Change, the special conversion right<br /><br />
will allow a holder exercising a special conversion right to<br /><br />
receive the same type of consideration received by the holders of<br /><br />
Common Stock and, thus, the degree of protection afforded by the<br /><br />
special conversion right may be affected by the type<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
consideration received.<br /><br />
As used herein, a "Change of Control" with respect to the<br /><br />
Company shall be deemed to have occurred at the first time after<br /><br />
the first issuance of any Amended Series A Preferred Stock that<br /><br />
any person (within the meaning of Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2)<br /><br />
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange<br /><br />
Act")) including a group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under<br /><br />
the Exchange Act), together with any of its Affiliates or<br /><br />
Associates (as defined below), files or becomes obligated to file<br /><br />
a report (or any amendment or supplement thereto) on Schedule 13D<br /><br />
or 14D-1 pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing that such person<br /><br />
has become the beneficial owner of either (a) 50% or more of the<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (b) securities<br /><br />
representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the<br /><br />
Voting Stock (as defined below) of the Company then outstanding,<br /><br />
provided that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have<br /><br />
occurred with respect to any transaction that constitutes a<br /><br />
Fundamental Change. An "Affiliate" of a specified person is a<br /><br />
person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by<br /><br />
or is under common control with, the person specified. An<br /><br />
"Associate" of a person means (i) any corporation or organization<br /><br />
other than the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, of which<br /><br />
the person is an officer or partner or is, directly<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
indirectly, the beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of<br /><br />
equity securities; (ii) any trust or estate in which the person<br /><br />
has a substantial beneficial interest or as to which the person<br /><br />
serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (iii)<br /><br />
any relative or spouse of the person or any relative of the<br /><br />
spouse, who has the same home as the person or who is a director<br /><br />
or officer or the person or any of its parents or subsidiaries.<br /><br />
As used herein, a "Fundamental Change" with respect to the<br /><br />
Company means (a) the occurrence of any transaction or event in<br /><br />
connection with which all or substantially all of the Common<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
constitutes<br /><br />
solely the right to receive cash, securities,<br /><br />
property or other assets (whether by means of an exchange offer,<br /><br />
liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination,<br /><br />
reclassification or otherwise) or (b) the conveyance, sale,<br /><br />
lease,<br /><br />
assignment, transfer or other disposal of all<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
substantially all of the Company's property, business or assets;<br /><br />
provided, however that a Fundamental Change shall not be deemed<br /><br />
to have occurred with respect to either of the following<br /><br />
transactions or events: (i) any transaction or event in which<br /><br />
more than 50% (by value as determined in good faith by the Board<br /><br />
of Directors of the Company) of the consideration received by<br /><br />
holders of Common Stock consists of Marketable Stock (as defined<br /><br />
below) or (ii) any consolidation or merger of the Company in<br /><br />
which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to such<br /><br />
transaction own, directly or indirectly, (1) 50% or more of the<br /><br />
common stock of the sole surviving corporation (or of the<br /><br />
ultimate parent of such sole surviving corporation) outstanding<br /><br />
at the time immediately after such consolidation or merger and<br /><br />
(2) securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting<br /><br />
power of the surviving corporation's Voting Stock (or the Voting<br /><br />
Stock of the ultimate parent of such surviving corporation)<br /><br />
outstanding at such time. The phrase "all or substantially all"<br /><br />
as used in this definition in reference to the Common Stock means<br /><br />
66% or more of the aggregate outstanding amount. Depending upon<br /><br />
the circumstances, there may be some uncertainty under Delaware<br /><br />
law as to whether a specific transaction constitutes a sale of<br /><br />
"all or substantially all" of the property, business or assets of<br /><br />
a company. This uncertainty may make it difficult for a holder to<br /><br />
determine whether or not a "Fundamental Change" has occurred, and<br /><br />
thus whether such holder is entitled to a special conversion<br /><br />
right in respect of the shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock held by such holder.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As used herein, "Voting Stock" means, with respect to any<br /><br />
person, capital stock of such person having general power under<br /><br />
ordinary circumstances to elect at least a majority of the board<br /><br />
of directors, managers or trustees of such persons (irrespective<br /><br />
of whether or not at the time capital stock or any other class or<br /><br />
classes shall have or might have voting power by reason of the<br /><br />
happening of any contingency).<br /><br />
As used herein , "Market Value" of the Common Stock or any<br /><br />
other Marketable Stock is the average of the last reported sales<br /><br />
prices of the Common Stock or such other Marketable Stock, as the<br /><br />
case may be, for the five business days ending on the last<br /><br />
business day preceding the date of the Fundamental Change or<br /><br />
Change of Control; provided, however, that if the Marketable<br /><br />
Stock is not traded on any national securities exchange or<br /><br />
similar quotation system as described in the definition of<br /><br />
"Marketable Stock" during such period, then the Market Value of<br /><br />
such Marketable Stock is the average of the last reported sales<br /><br />
prices per share of such Marketable Stock during the first five<br /><br />
business days commencing on the day after the date on which such<br /><br />
Marketable Stock was first distributed to the general public and<br /><br />
traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), the AMEX, the<br /><br />
NASDAQ NSM or any similar system of automated dissemination of<br /><br />
quotations of securities prices in the United States.<br /><br />
As<br /><br />
<br /><br />
used herein, "Marketable Stock" means Common Stock or<br /><br />
common stock of any corporation that is the successor (or the<br /><br />
ultimate parent of such successor) to all or substantially all of<br /><br />
the business or assets of the Company as a result of a<br /><br />
Fundamental Change, which is (or will, upon distribution thereof,<br /><br />
be) listed or quoted on the NYSE, the AMEX, the NASDAQ NSM or any<br /><br />
similar system of automated dissemination of quotations or<br /><br />
securities prices in the United States.<br /><br />
Liquidation Rights<br /><br />
------------------In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up<br /><br />
of the Company, after payment or provision for payment of the<br /><br />
debts and other liabilities of the Company, the holders of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,<br /><br />
out of the remaining net assets of the Company available for<br /><br />
distribution to stockholders, liquidating distributions in the<br /><br />
amount of $85.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all dividends<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid on each such share (whether or not declared)<br /><br />
to the date fixed for distribution, before any distribution is<br /><br />
made to holders of the Common Stock or any other class of stock<br /><br />
of the Company ranking junior to the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
After receiving payment of the full amount of the<br /><br />
liquidating distribution to which they are entitled, the holders<br /><br />
of shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock will not be<br /><br />
entitled to any further participation in any remaining assets of<br /><br />
the Company. If upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of<br /><br />
the Company, the amounts payable with respect to the Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock and any other capital stock ranking as<br /><br />
to such distribution on a parity with the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock with respect to such distributions ("Parity<br /><br />
Stock") are not paid in full, the holders of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and of such other Parity Stock will share ratably<br /><br />
in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full<br /><br />
respective preferential amounts to which they are entitled.<br /><br />
Currently, the Amended Series B Preferred Stock constitutes<br /><br />
Parity Stock. See "-- Description of Existing Capital Stock -Preferred Stock." Neither the consolidation or merger of the<br /><br />
Company with another corporation nor a sale, conveyance, lease,<br /><br />
transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of the Company's<br /><br />
assets will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding<br /><br />
up of the Company for these purposes.<br /><br />
Optional Redemption<br /><br />
------------------The Amended Series A Preferred Stock will not be redeemable<br /><br />
prior to May 1, 2002. On or after such date, the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock may be redeemed for cash, in whole or in part, at<br /><br />
the option of the Company at any time or from time to time, on<br /><br />
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following<br /><br />
prices per share during the 12-month period beginning on May 1 of<br /><br />
the year indicated:<br /><br />

(whether or not declared) accrued and unpaid to the date of<br /><br />
redemption.<br /><br />
If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock<br /><br />
are to be redeemed, the Company will select those to be redeemed<br /><br />
ratably or by lot in a manner determined by the Board of<br /><br />
Directors. All dividends upon the shares of Preferred Stock<br /><br />
called for redemption shall cease to accrue and all rights of the<br /><br />
holders thereof as shareholders of the Company (except the right<br /><br />
to receive the redemption price, including any accrued and unpaid<br /><br />
dividends to the date of redemption, without interest upon the<br /><br />
presentation of certificates representing the redeemed shares)<br /><br />
shall terminate on the date of redemption.<br /><br />
Mandatory Redemption<br /><br />
-------------------The Amended Series A Preferred Stock will be mandatorily<br /><br />
redeemed, in whole, on May 1, 2007, upon not less than 30 nor<br /><br />
more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price of $85.00 per<br /><br />
share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
declared) to the redemption date, payable in cash or, at the<br /><br />
election of the Company, in shares of Common Stock, valued at the<br /><br />
average of the Market Price over the 20 trading days preceding<br /><br />
the date of notice of redemption.<br /><br />
Voting Rights<br /><br />
------------In addition to any special voting rights granted by law and<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
class<br /><br />
voting rights described in the following<br /><br />
two<br /><br />
paragraphs, the holders of Amended Series A Preferred Stock will<br /><br />
be entitled to vote with the holders of Common Stock on all<br /><br />
matters on which the holders of Common Stock are entitled to<br /><br />
vote.<br /><br />
Further, each share of the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock will entitle the holder thereof to cast the same number of<br /><br />
votes as the full shares of Common Stock then issuable upon<br /><br />
conversion thereof.<br /><br />
Whenever dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
are in arrears in an amount equal to or exceeding three semiannual dividends (whether or not consecutive and whether payable<br /><br />
in cash or shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock), the<br /><br />
number of directors of the Company will automatically<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
increased by two and the holders of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class) will be entitled<br /><br />
to elect the additional two directors until all dividends that<br /><br />
were accrued and unpaid have been paid or declared and funds or<br /><br />
shares, as the case may be, set aside to provide for payment in<br /><br />
full. Upon any termination of such rights to vote for directors,<br /><br />
the term of office of all directors so elected shall terminate.<br /><br />
Without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at<br /><br />
least two-thirds of the number of shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock then outstanding, the Company may not (a) create<br /><br />
or issue or increase the authorized number of shares of any class<br /><br />
or classes or series of stock ranking senior to the Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock, either as to dividends or upon<br /><br />
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or (b) alter, change or<br /><br />
repeal any of the powers, rights or preferences of the holders of<br /><br />
the Amended Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely<br /><br />
such powers, preferences or rights of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the voting rights of the holders of<br /><br />
Amended<br /><br />
Series<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock could,<br /><br />
under<br /><br />
certain<br /><br />
circumstances, operate to restrict the flexibility the Company<br /><br />
would otherwise have in connection with any future issuances of<br /><br />
equity securities or changes to its capital structure.<br /><br />
Miscellaneous<br /><br />
<br /><br />
------------The Preferred Stock, when designated, issued and paid for,<br /><br />
will be fully paid and nonassessable. The Preferred Stock has no<br /><br />
preemptive rights and is not subject to any sinking fund.<br /><br />
Amended Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
- -------------------------------On March 4, 1998, in connection with settlement of<br /><br />
litigation instituted by the holder of the Company's Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock, the holder thereof sold its 44,465 shares of<br /><br />
Series<br /><br />
B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and associated<br /><br />
warrants.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
purchasers, in a simultaneous transaction exchanged the shares of<br /><br />
Series B Preferred Stock for Amended Series B Preferred Stock and<br /><br />
warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to<br /><br />
adjustment. The Amended Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to<br /><br />
50 votes per share on all matters on which Common Stockholders<br /><br />
are entitled to vote and separately as a class on certain<br /><br />
matters; has a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus<br /><br />
accumulated dividends and ranks senior to the Common Stock and<br /><br />
pari passu with the Amended Series A Preferred Stock with respect<br /><br />
to the payment of dividends and distributions on liquidation; is<br /><br />
convertible by the holders thereof at any time after the earlier<br /><br />
of the effective date of the registration under the Securities<br /><br />
Act of the conversion stock or August 31, 1998, at $4.75 if the<br /><br />
conversion stock has been registered or at $3.80 if<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conversion stock is unregistered; is redeemable at the option of<br /><br />
the holder at any time after December 20, 2001 at $100.00 per<br /><br />
share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, payable at the Company's<br /><br />
election in shares of Common Stock; and bears a fixed cumulative<br /><br />
dividend at an annual rate of $9.50 per share, payable semiannually in either cash, shares of Common Stock, or additional<br /><br />
shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock, at the Company's<br /><br />
option.<br /><br />
Shares Eligible for Future Sale<br /><br />
- ------------------------------As of September 30, 1998, there were reserved an aggregate<br /><br />
of (i) 4,991,691 shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding<br /><br />
options; (ii) 14,840,593 shares issuable upon conversion of the<br /><br />
Company's outstanding Amended Series A Preferred Stock; (iii)<br /><br />
1,250,000 shares issuable upon conversion of the Company's<br /><br />
outstanding Amended Series B Preferred Stock; (iv) 17,060,604<br /><br />
shares issuable upon exercise of the Company's outstanding<br /><br />
warrants; (v) 104,375 shares reserved for sale to fund working<br /><br />
capital for the Company's China projects; (vi) 60,690 reserved<br /><br />
for sale to fund general working capital requirements of the<br /><br />
Company; and (vii) 387,388 shares issuable in connection with<br /><br />
contractual obligations. The Company would receive a total of<br /><br />
approximately $63.2 million if all options and warrants were<br /><br />
exercised and all stock reserved for sale was sold at $3.00 per<br /><br />
share.<br /><br />
Additionally, the Company will have approximately 438<br /><br />
million shares of Common Stock available for issuance at such<br /><br />
times and upon such terms as may be approved by the Company's<br /><br />
Board of Directors. No prediction can be made as to the effect,<br /><br />
if any, that future sales or the availability of shares for sale<br /><br />
will have on the market price of the Common Stock prevailing from<br /><br />
time to time.<br /><br />
Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of<br /><br />
Common Stock of the Company in the public market could adversely<br /><br />
affect the prevailing market price of the Common Stock and could<br /><br />
impair the Company's ability to raise capital through sales of<br /><br />
its equity securities.<br /><br />
Approximately 6.8 million shares of Common Stock (including<br /><br />
shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
conversion of convertible securities, the<br /><br />
"Restricted<br /><br />
Shares") are held by executive officers and directors of the<br /><br />
Company and affiliates of the Company and may be sold pursuant to<br /><br />
an effective registration statement covering such shares or<br /><br />
pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, subject to the<br /><br />
restrictions described below.<br /><br />
In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, a person<br /><br />
(or persons whose shares are aggregated), including an affiliate,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
who has beneficially owned Restricted Shares for a least one<br /><br />
year, is entitled to sell within any three-month period, a number<br /><br />
of shares that does not exceed the greater of (i) 1% of the then<br /><br />
outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock or (ii) an<br /><br />
amount equal to the average weekly reported volume of trading in<br /><br />
such shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on<br /><br />
which notice of such sale is filed with the Commission.<br /><br />
Sales<br /><br />
under Rule 144 are also subject to certain manner of sale<br /><br />
limitations, notice requirements and the availability of current<br /><br />
public information about the Company. Restricted Shares properly<br /><br />
sold in reliance on Rule 144 are thereafter freely tradable<br /><br />
without restrictions or registration under the Securities Act,<br /><br />
unless thereafter held by an affiliate of the Company.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
addition, affiliates of the Company must comply with<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
restrictions and requirements of Rule 144, other than the oneyear holding period requirement, in order to sell shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock which are not Restricted Shares. As defined in Rule<br /><br />
144, an "affiliate" of an issuer is a person that directly, or<br /><br />
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is<br /><br />
controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.<br /><br />
If<br /><br />
two years have elapsed since the later of the date of any<br /><br />
acquisition of Restricted Shares from the Company or from any<br /><br />
affiliate of the Company, and the acquiror or subsequent holder<br /><br />
thereof is deemed not to have been an affiliate of the Company at<br /><br />
any time during the three months preceding a sale, such person<br /><br />
would be entitled to sell such shares in the public market<br /><br />
pursuant to Rule 144(k) without regard to volume limitations,<br /><br />
manner of sale restrictions, or public information or notice<br /><br />
requirements.<br /><br />
MATERIAL UNITED STATES INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS<br /><br />
The following discussion is a summary of material federal<br /><br />
income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and<br /><br />
disposition of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock and the<br /><br />
Common Stock, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of<br /><br />
all the potential tax effects thereof. The discussion is based<br /><br />
upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), Treasury<br /><br />
regulations, and Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rulings and<br /><br />
judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to<br /><br />
change at any time by legislative, judicial or administrative<br /><br />
action. No information is provided herein with respect to state<br /><br />
and local taxes or estate and gift tax considerations.<br /><br />
This<br /><br />
information is directed to the original investors who hold the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock and the Common Stock as "capital<br /><br />
assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. In<br /><br />
addition, this discussion does not address the tax consequences<br /><br />
to certain holders as to whom special rules apply (including life<br /><br />
insurance companies, tax exempt organizations, banks and dealers<br /><br />
in securities). The Company has not sought, nor does it intend<br /><br />
to seek an opinion from tax counsel, or a ruling from the IRS<br /><br />
that the tax consequences described in the following discussion<br /><br />
will be accepted by the IRS. This discussion does not purport to<br /><br />
address all federal income tax aspects that may be relevant to<br /><br />
holders<br /><br />
in light of their particular circumstances.<br /><br />
Each<br /><br />
prospective investor should consult and should rely on his own<br /><br />
tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to him of the<br /><br />
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock.<br /><br />
Taxation of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------------------------------------Dividends on Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
---------------------------------------------------------Dividends paid on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock or<br /><br />
Common Stock will be taxable under Section 301 of the Code as<br /><br />
ordinary income to the extent of the Company's current and<br /><br />
accumulated "earnings and profits" (as defined in the Code).<br /><br />
Dividends received by corporate holders of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock or Common Stock out of such earnings and profits<br /><br />
generally will qualify, subject to the limitations under Sections<br /><br />
246(c) and 246A of the Code, for the 70% dividends received<br /><br />
deduction allowable to corporations under Section 243 of the Code<br /><br />
(although the benefits of such deduction may be reduced or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
eliminated by the corporate alternative minimum tax). Under<br /><br />
Section 246(c) of the Code, to be eligible for the dividends<br /><br />
received deduction, a corporate holder must hold its shares of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock for at least 46<br /><br />
days during the 90-day period beginning 45 days before the date<br /><br />
on which the shares became ex-dividend (91 days during the 180day period beginning 90 days before the shares became ex-dividend<br /><br />
in the case of a preferred dividend attributable to a period or<br /><br />
periods aggregating more than 366 days). A taxpayer's holding<br /><br />
period for these purposes is suspended during any period in which<br /><br />
the taxpayer has an option to sell, is under a contractual<br /><br />
obligation to sell, has made (and not closed) a short sale of, or<br /><br />
has granted an option to buy, substantially identical stock or<br /><br />
securities, or holds one or more other positions with respect to<br /><br />
substantially similar or related property that diminish the risk<br /><br />
of loss from holding such stock. Under Section 246A of the Code,<br /><br />
the dividends received deduction may be reduced or eliminated if<br /><br />
a holder's shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common<br /><br />
Stock are debt financed.<br /><br />
Section 1059 of the Code requires a corporate stockholder to<br /><br />
reduce its basis (but not below zero) in the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or Common Stock by the nontaxed<br /><br />
portion<br /><br />
(generally the portion eligible for the dividends received<br /><br />
deduction described above) of any "extraordinary dividend" if the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock has not been<br /><br />
held for more than two years before the date of announcement or<br /><br />
agreement with respect to such dividend.<br /><br />
In addition,<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
corporate holder of Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common<br /><br />
Stock would recognize additional gain on the disposition of such<br /><br />
stock equal to any nontaxed portions of any extraordinary<br /><br />
dividend that would have reduced such holder's basis but for the<br /><br />
limitation on reducing basis below zero.<br /><br />
An "extraordinary<br /><br />
dividend" generally is a dividend that (a) equals or exceeds 5%<br /><br />
in the case of preferred stock, or 10% in the case of common<br /><br />
stock, of the holder's adjusted basis in such stock, treating all<br /><br />
dividends having ex-dividend dates within a period of<br /><br />
85<br /><br />
consecutive days as one dividend or (b) exceeds 20 percent of the<br /><br />
holder's basis in such stock, treating all dividends having exdividend dates within a period of 365 consecutive days as one<br /><br />
dividend, provided that in either case fair market value of the<br /><br />
stock on the day before the ex-dividend date, if it can be<br /><br />
established by the holder, may be substituted for the stock<br /><br />
basis. In addition, an amount treated as a dividend in the case<br /><br />
of a redemption of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock that is<br /><br />
either non-pro rata as to all stockholders or in partial<br /><br />
liquidation would also constitute an "extraordinary dividend"<br /><br />
without regard to the length of time the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock has been held. Special rules apply with respect<br /><br />
to a "qualified preferred dividend," which would include any<br /><br />
fixed dividend payable with respect to the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock, provided it is not in arrears as to dividends<br /><br />
when acquired and the actual rate of return on the Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock does not exceed 15% calculated by reference to<br /><br />
the lower of the holder's basis in the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or its liquidation preference. The extraordinary dividend<br /><br />
rules will not apply to a qualified preferred dividend if the<br /><br />
holder has held the Amended Series A Preferred Stock for more<br /><br />
than five years. If the holder disposes of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock before it has been held for more than five years,<br /><br />
the aggregate reduction in basis will not exceed the excess of<br /><br />
the qualified preferred dividends paid during the period the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock was held by the holder over the<br /><br />
qualified preferred dividends which would have been paid during<br /><br />
such period on the basis of the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock's stated rate of return calculated by reference to the<br /><br />
lower of the holder's basis in the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or its liquidation preference.<br /><br />
To the extent that a distribution on Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or Common Stock exceeds the current<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
accumulated<br /><br />
earnings<br /><br />
and profits of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company,<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
distribution will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital<br /><br />
which reduces the holder's basis in its Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock or Common Stock. Any such distribution in excess<br /><br />
of a holder's basis will be treated as short-term or long-term<br /><br />
capital gain, depending on whether the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or Common Stock has been held for more than one year.<br /><br />
At the present time, the Company has no accumulated earnings<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and profits for federal income tax purposes, and it is uncertain<br /><br />
whether and to what extent the Company will have current or<br /><br />
accumulated earnings and profits in the future.<br /><br />
Accordingly,<br /><br />
there can be no assurance that distributions to corporate holders<br /><br />
of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock will<br /><br />
qualify for the dividends received deduction.<br /><br />
Redemption Premium on Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
-----------------------------------------------------Under Section 305 of the Code and applicable Treasury<br /><br />
regulations, if the redemption price of redeemable preferred<br /><br />
stock exceeds its issue price and part (or all) of such excess is<br /><br />
considered an unreasonable redemption premium, the entire amount<br /><br />
of such excess is treated as distributed over the period during<br /><br />
which the preferred stock cannot be redeemed. The amount treated<br /><br />
as distributed each year would be determined on a constant yield<br /><br />
to maturity basis that would result in the allocation of a lesser<br /><br />
amount of distributions to the early years and a greater amount<br /><br />
to the later years of such period. Any such constructive<br /><br />
distribution would be classified as a dividend, a non-taxable<br /><br />
recovery of basis or an amount received in exchange for the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the rules summed up<br /><br />
under " -- Dividends on Amended Series A Preferred Stock or<br /><br />
Common Stock." Any such constructive distribution would be taken<br /><br />
into account for proposes of applying the extraordinary dividend<br /><br />
rules discussed above.<br /><br />
Under recently issued Treasury Regulations, a redemption<br /><br />
premium that would be paid in the event of an issuer call is<br /><br />
considered unreasonable only if, based on all the facts and<br /><br />
circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to the<br /><br />
call is more likely than not to occur. Even if a redemption is<br /><br />
considered more likely than not to occur, the redemption premium<br /><br />
is not subject to the current inclusion rule if it is solely in<br /><br />
the nature of a penalty for premature redemption. A redemption<br /><br />
premium is considered a penalty for premature redemption only if<br /><br />
it is paid as a result of changes in economic or market<br /><br />
conditions over which neither the issuer nor the holder has legal<br /><br />
or practical control.<br /><br />
Under a safe harbor, a redemption is not treated as more<br /><br />
likely than not to occur if (i) the issuer and holder are not<br /><br />
"related," (ii) there are no plans, arrangements, or agreements<br /><br />
that effectively require or are intended to compel the issuer to<br /><br />
redeem the stock (other than a mandatory redemption right<br /><br />
exercisable by the holder), and (iii) exercise of the call right<br /><br />
would not reduce the yield of the stock, as determined under<br /><br />
principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a) of the<br /><br />
Code and the Treasury Regulations under sections 1271 through<br /><br />
1275. The Company anticipates that any call of the Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock will fall within this safe harbor, although no<br /><br />
assurance can be given that it will fall within the safe harbor.<br /><br />
Assuming that the redemption does not fall within the safe<br /><br />
harbor discussed above, the Company believes, based upon the<br /><br />
facts and circumstances existing at the time of issuance, that it<br /><br />
is not more likely than not that the redemption will occur. The<br /><br />
Company further believes that, even if the IRS were to treat the<br /><br />
redemption as more likely than not to occur, the redemption<br /><br />
premium should be considered a penalty paid for premature<br /><br />
redemption of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Redemption or Sale of Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
-----------------------------------------------------A redemption of Amended Series A Preferred Stock for cash<br /><br />
will be treated, under Section 302 of the Code, as (i) a<br /><br />
distribution treated as a taxable dividend, (ii) a nontaxable<br /><br />
recovery of basis, or (iii) an amount received in exchange for<br /><br />
the Amended Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the rules<br /><br />
described under " -- Dividends on Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or Common Stock," unless the redemption (a) results in a<br /><br />
"complete termination" of the stockholder's interest in the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
under<br /><br />
Section 302(b)(3) of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Code;<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
"substantially disproportionate" with respect to the stockholder<br /><br />
under Section 302(b)(2) of the Code; or (c) is "not essentially<br /><br />
equivalent to a dividend" under Section 302(b)(1) of the Code. In<br /><br />
determining whether any of these tests have been met, shares<br /><br />
considered to be owned by the stockholder by reason of certain<br /><br />
<br /><br />
constructive ownership rules in Sections 302(c) and 318(a) of the<br /><br />
Code, as well as shares actually owned, must be taken into<br /><br />
account. If any of these tests are met, the redemption of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock for cash would be treated as a<br /><br />
sale or exchange for tax purposes.<br /><br />
A redemption will be "not essentially equivalent to a<br /><br />
dividend" as to a particular stockholder if it results in a<br /><br />
meaningful reduction in that stockholder's interest in the<br /><br />
Company. If, as a result of the redemption of the Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock, a stockholder of the Company, whose relative<br /><br />
interest in the Company is minimal and who exercises no control<br /><br />
over corporate affairs, suffers a reduction in his proportionate<br /><br />
interest<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
(taking<br /><br />
into<br /><br />
account<br /><br />
shares<br /><br />
constructively owned by the stockholder and, in certain events,<br /><br />
dispositions of the stock that occur contemporaneously with the<br /><br />
redemption), that stockholder should be regarded as having<br /><br />
suffered a meaningful reduction in his interest in the Company.<br /><br />
If, under the foregoing rules, a redemption of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock is treated as a sale or exchange, rather<br /><br />
than as a distribution, or if the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock is sold, the holder would recognize taxable gain or loss<br /><br />
equal to the difference between the amount realized and the<br /><br />
holder's tax basis in the Amended Series A Preferred Stock. For<br /><br />
these purposes, the amount realized will generally be measured by<br /><br />
the amount of cash and the fair market value of any other<br /><br />
property received. The holder's initial cost basis in the Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock will be that portion of the initial<br /><br />
Equity Unit price that is allocated to the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock based upon the relative fair market values of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrants. Each holder<br /><br />
should consult his tax adviser regarding the determination of the<br /><br />
initial cost basis of the Securities comprising the Units.<br /><br />
If a redemption of Amended Series A Preferred Stock is<br /><br />
treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will<br /><br />
generally be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market<br /><br />
value of any other property received. The stockholder's basis in<br /><br />
the redeemed Amended Series A Preferred Stock will be transferred<br /><br />
to any remaining stockholdings in the Company.<br /><br />
A distribution to a corporate stockholder in redemption of<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock that is treated as a dividend<br /><br />
may also be considered an "extraordinary dividend" under Section<br /><br />
1059 of the Code. See " -- Dividends on Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock or Common Stock." A redemption that is treated as<br /><br />
a dividend that is not pro rata as to all stockholders may be<br /><br />
treated as an extraordinary dividend without regard to the period<br /><br />
during which the stockholder held the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
Conversion of Amended Series A Preferred Stock Into Common<br /><br />
Stock<br /><br />
----------------------------------------------------------In general, no gain or loss will be recognized for federal<br /><br />
income tax purposes on conversion of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock solely into shares of Common Stock, except with respect to<br /><br />
any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock.<br /><br />
If dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock are in<br /><br />
arrears at the time of conversion, however, a portion of the<br /><br />
Common Stock received in exchange for Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock could be viewed under Section 305(c) of the Code as a<br /><br />
distribution with respect to the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock, taxable as a dividend. The tax basis for Common Stock<br /><br />
received on conversion will be equal to the tax basis of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock converted, reduced by the<br /><br />
portion of basis allocable to any fractional share exchanged for<br /><br />
cash. The holding period of the shares of Common Stock will<br /><br />
include the holding period of such Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
Adjustment of Conversion Price<br /><br />
-----------------------------Section 305 of the Code treats holders of convertible<br /><br />
securities<br /><br />
as having received a constructive<br /><br />
distribution<br /><br />
(taxable as a dividend to the extent of the issuing corporation's<br /><br />
current<br /><br />
or accumulated earnings and profits) when certain<br /><br />
<br /><br />
adjustments are made to the conversion price and conversion ratio<br /><br />
of such securities. For example, a constructive distribution<br /><br />
results when the conversion price is adjusted to reflect certain<br /><br />
taxable distributions with respect to the stock into which<br /><br />
preferred stock is convertible. Adjustment of the Conversion<br /><br />
Price and the Conversion Ratio at which the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock can be converted (which may occur under certain<br /><br />
circumstances) could cause the holders thereof to be viewed under<br /><br />
Section 305 of the Code as having received a deemed distribution<br /><br />
taxable as a dividend whether or not such holders exercise their<br /><br />
conversion rights.<br /><br />
Foreign Holders<br /><br />
- --------------The following discussion is a summary of material United<br /><br />
States federal income tax consequences to a Foreign Person that<br /><br />
holds a Security. The Company has not sought, nor does it intend<br /><br />
to seek, an opinion from tax counsel or a ruling from the IRS<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
respect<br /><br />
to the matters addressed in the<br /><br />
following<br /><br />
discussion. The term "Foreign Person" means a nonresident alien<br /><br />
individual or foreign corporation, but only if the income or gain<br /><br />
on the Security is not "effectively connected with the conduct of<br /><br />
a trade or business within the United States." If the income or<br /><br />
gain on the Security is "effectively connected with the conduct<br /><br />
of a trade or business within the United States," then the<br /><br />
nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation will be<br /><br />
subject to tax on such income or gain in essentially the same<br /><br />
manner as a United States citizen or resident or a domestic<br /><br />
corporation, as discussed herein, and in the case of a foreign<br /><br />
corporation, may also be subject to the branch profits tax.<br /><br />
In general, gain (to the extent it is not "effectively<br /><br />
connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the<br /><br />
United<br /><br />
States") recognized by a Foreign Person upon<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
redemption, sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a<br /><br />
share of Amended Series A Preferred Stock or of shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock will not be subject to United States federal income tax<br /><br />
unless such Foreign Person is an individual present in the United<br /><br />
States for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which the<br /><br />
disposition occurs and certain other requirements are met, or<br /><br />
unless the Company was a United States real property holding<br /><br />
corporation at any time during the five years preceding the<br /><br />
disposition while the Foreign Person held an interest in the<br /><br />
Company. Although the Company has previously been treated as a<br /><br />
United States real property holding corporation for United States<br /><br />
federal<br /><br />
income tax purposes because of its ownership<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
substantial real estate assets in the United States, the Company<br /><br />
believes that it is not presently a United States real property<br /><br />
holding corporation because the fair market value of its United<br /><br />
States real property interests now constitutes less than 50% of<br /><br />
the total fair market value of its real estate assets, including<br /><br />
its Chinese assets. If the Company were again to become a United<br /><br />
States real property holding corporation in the future, either<br /><br />
because of a change in the fair market values of its current<br /><br />
properties or through acquisitions of real property interests, a<br /><br />
Foreign Person who holds Amended Series A Preferred Stock or<br /><br />
Common Stock would generally be subject to United States federal<br /><br />
income tax on any gain recognized from sale or other disposition<br /><br />
of Amended Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, unless the<br /><br />
Common Stock is traded on an established securities market and a<br /><br />
Foreign Person does not directly or constructively own Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock with a fair market value<br /><br />
on the date of acquisition of more than 5% of the fair market<br /><br />
value of the outstanding Common Stock on such date. If subject to<br /><br />
United States federal income tax, the gain would be treated as<br /><br />
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business<br /><br />
within the United States and the sale or other disposition<br /><br />
generally would be subject to withholding tax equal to 10% of the<br /><br />
amount realized therefrom.<br /><br />
Distributions paid on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
or Common Stock to a Foreign Person (other than distributions<br /><br />
that constitute income effectively connected with a United States<br /><br />
trade or business) will be subject to United States federal<br /><br />
income tax withholding at a rate of 30% of the amount of the<br /><br />
distribution (unless the rate is reduced by an applicable tax<br /><br />
treaty). If the Company derives at least 80% of its gross income<br /><br />
from the active conduct of a trade or business outside the United<br /><br />
States for a period of three years prior to the taxable year of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the distribution (or for the taxable year of the distribution if<br /><br />
the Company has no gross income for such three-year period), then<br /><br />
distributions to Foreign Holders of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock or Common Stock will not be subject to withholding.<br /><br />
Any Foreign Person that recognizes gain upon the redemption,<br /><br />
sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a share of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock or of shares of Common Stock or receives<br /><br />
a dividend on the Common Stock that is "effectively connected<br /><br />
with the conduct of a trade or business with the United States"<br /><br />
will be subject to tax in essentially the same manner as a U.S.<br /><br />
person, as discussed above. A Foreign Person that is a foreign<br /><br />
corporation engaged in a U.S. trade or business also may be<br /><br />
subject to the branch profits tax with respect to such gain or<br /><br />
dividend.<br /><br />
Backup Withholding<br /><br />
- -----------------A noncorporate holder may be subject, under certain<br /><br />
circumstances, to backup withholding at a 31% rate with respect<br /><br />
to payments received with respect to the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock. This withholding generally<br /><br />
applies only if the holder (i) fails to furnish his, her or its<br /><br />
social security or other taxpayer identification number ("TIN"),<br /><br />
(ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) is notified by the IRS<br /><br />
that he, she or it has failed to report properly payments of<br /><br />
interest and dividends and the IRS has notified the Company that<br /><br />
he, she or it is subject to backup withholding, or (iv) fails,<br /><br />
under certain circumstances, to provide a certified statement,<br /><br />
signed under penalty of perjury, that the TIN provided is his,<br /><br />
her or its correct number and that he, she or it is not subject<br /><br />
to backup withholding. Any amount withheld from a payment to a<br /><br />
holder under the backup withholding rules is allowable as a<br /><br />
credit against such holder's federal income tax liability,<br /><br />
provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.<br /><br />
Certain holders (including, among others, corporations<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
foreign<br /><br />
individuals who comply with certain<br /><br />
certification<br /><br />
requirements) are not subject to backup withholding. Holders<br /><br />
should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for<br /><br />
exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining<br /><br />
such an exemption.<br /><br />

The Company is registering the Securities on behalf of the<br /><br />
Selling Security Holders.<br /><br />
As used herein, "Selling Security<br /><br />
Holders"<br /><br />
includes pledgees, donees, transferrees or<br /><br />
other<br /><br />
successors in interest to be named Selling Security Holder after<br /><br />
the date of this Prospectus. The Securities may be sold from<br /><br />
time to time on one or more exchanges or in the over-the-counter<br /><br />
market or in private transactions or otherwise, at prices and at<br /><br />
terms then prevailing or at prices related to the then current<br /><br />
market price, or in negotiated transactions. The Securities may<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
sold<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
one or more of the following:<br /><br />
negotiated<br /><br />
transactions; a block trade in which the broker-dealer so engaged<br /><br />
will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and<br /><br />
resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the<br /><br />
transaction; purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
broker-dealer for its account pursuant to<br /><br />
this<br /><br />
Prospectus; an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
such exchange; and ordinary brokerage transactions and<br /><br />
transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers.<br /><br />
Such<br /><br />
transactions may or may not involve brokers or dealers.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
effecting sales, broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Security<br /><br />
Holders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in<br /><br />
the resales.<br /><br />
In connection with distributions of the Securities or<br /><br />
otherwise, the Selling Security Holders may enter into hedging<br /><br />
transaction with broker-dealers or others. In connection with<br /><br />
such transactions, Selling Security Holders, broker-dealers or<br /><br />
others may engage in put and call options and in short sales of<br /><br />
the shares registered hereunder in the course of hedging the<br /><br />
positions they assume. The Selling Security Holders may also<br /><br />

registered hereunder, which the broker-dealer may resell or<br /><br />
otherwise transfer pursuant to this Prospectus.<br /><br />
The Selling<br /><br />
Security<br /><br />
Holders may also loan or pledge the<br /><br />
Securities<br /><br />
registered hereunder to a broker-dealer or other third party and<br /><br />
the broker-dealer and such other third party may sell the<br /><br />
Securities so loaned or upon a default the broker-dealer or other<br /><br />
third party may effect sales of the pledged Securities pursuant<br /><br />
to this Prospectus.<br /><br />
Broker-dealers or agents may receive compensation in the<br /><br />
form of commissions, discounts or concessions from Selling<br /><br />
Security Holders in amounts to be negotiated in connection with<br /><br />
the sale. Such broker-dealers and any other participating brokerdealers may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of<br /><br />
the Securities Act, in connection with such sales and any such<br /><br />
commission, discount or concession received by broker-dealers may<br /><br />
be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the<br /><br />
Securities Act.<br /><br />
In addition, any Securities covered by this<br /><br />
Prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rules 144, 144A or<br /><br />
904 may be sold under such Rules rather than pursuant to this<br /><br />
Prospectus.<br /><br />
The Selling Security Holders may agree to indemnify any<br /><br />
broker-dealer<br /><br />
or agent that participates<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
transactions<br /><br />
involving sales of the Securities against certain liabilities,<br /><br />
including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company and certain of the Security Holders have agreed to<br /><br />
indemnify certain persons including broker-dealers or agents<br /><br />
against certain liabilities in connection with the offering of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities,<br /><br />
including liabilities arising<br /><br />
under<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities Act. Because Selling Security Holders may be deemed<br /><br />
to be "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the<br /><br />
Securities Act, the Selling Security Holders will be subject to<br /><br />
the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, which<br /><br />
may include delivery through the facilities of the AMEX pursuant<br /><br />
to Rule 153 under the Securities Act. The Company has informed<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Selling<br /><br />
Security<br /><br />
Holders that the<br /><br />
anti-manipulative<br /><br />
provisions of Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act may<br /><br />
apply to their sales in the market.<br /><br />
Upon the Company being notified by a Selling Security Holder<br /><br />
that any material arrangement has been entered into with a brokerdealer for the sale of the Securities through a block trade,<br /><br />
special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution<br /><br />
or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a supplement to this<br /><br />
Prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b)<br /><br />
under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of each such<br /><br />
Selling<br /><br />
Security Holder and of the participating<br /><br />
brokerdealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at<br /><br />
which such shares were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or<br /><br />
discounts or concessions allowed such broker-dealer(s), where<br /><br />
applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any<br /><br />
investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated<br /><br />
by reference in this Prospectus and (vi) other facts material to<br /><br />
the transaction. In addition, upon the Company being notified by<br /><br />
a Selling Security Holder that a donee or pledgee intends to sell<br /><br />
more than 500 shares, a supplement to this Prospectus will be<br /><br />
filed.<br /><br />
On<br /><br />
<br /><br />
May 20, 1997, the Company entered into two Registration<br /><br />
Rights Agreements (collectively, the "Registration Agreements")<br /><br />
with Jefferies as the initial purchaser in the Offerings.<br /><br />
Pursuant to the Registration Agreements, the initial purchaser<br /><br />
and all subsequent holders of Amended Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
and Equity Warrants issued in the Offerings were granted certain<br /><br />
registration rights with respect to the Amended Series<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of<br /><br />
the Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
In addition, the Company is registering certain outstanding<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock previously issued in certain private<br /><br />
placements, as well as Common Stock issuable on exercise of<br /><br />
certain outstanding warrants, pursuant to certain "piggy back"<br /><br />
<br /><br />
registration covenants and other contractual agreements to<br /><br />
the Company is subject.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Pursuant<br /><br />
to such Registration Agreements and<br /><br />
other<br /><br />
contractual arrangements, the Company has agreed to indemnify the<br /><br />
Selling Security Holders against certain liabilities, including<br /><br />
liabilities under the Securities Act.<br /><br />
The Company is registering the Securities at its expense<br /><br />
including paying all filing, printing, legal and accounting fees<br /><br />
in connection therewith; provided, however, the Selling Security<br /><br />
Holders will pay all applicable stock transfer taxes, brokerage<br /><br />
commissions, discounts or other transaction charges and expenses.<br /><br />
Jefferies has performed and may in the future<br /><br />
various investment banking services for the Company.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
perform<br /><br />
<br /><br />

GLOSSARY OF TERMS<br /><br />
Unless otherwise indicated in this Prospectus, natural gas<br /><br />
volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the State or<br /><br />
area in which the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />
Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf<br /><br />
of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.<br /><br />
The following definitions shall apply to the technical terms<br /><br />
used in this Prospectus.<br /><br />
"Bbl" means barrel or barrels.<br /><br />
"Bcf" means billion cubic feet.<br /><br />
"BOE" means barrel of crude oil equivalent.<br /><br />
"BOPD" means barrel per day.<br /><br />
"DD&amp;A" means depletion, depreciation and amortization.<br /><br />
"Developed acreage" means acreage which consists<br /><br />
acres spaced or assignable to productive wells.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"Developed well" means a well drilled within the proved<br /><br />
area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of<br /><br />
stratigraphic horizon (rock layer or formation) known to be<br /><br />
productive for the purpose of extraction of proved crude oil<br /><br />
or natural gas reserves.<br /><br />
"Dry hole" means an exploratory or development well<br /><br />
found to be incapable of producing either crude oil or gas<br /><br />
in sufficient quantities to justify completion as a crude<br /><br />
oil or natural gas well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"EBITDA" means earnings from continuing operations<br /><br />
before income taxes, interest expense, DD&amp;A and other noncash charges.<br /><br />
"Exploratory well" means a well drilled to find and<br /><br />
produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to<br /><br />
find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be<br /><br />
producing crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or<br /><br />
to extend a known reservoir.<br /><br />
"Farmout" means a leasehold held by the owner thereof<br /><br />
under an agreement between operators, whereby a lease owner<br /><br />
not desirous of drilling at the time agrees to assign the<br /><br />
lease, or some portion of it (in common or in severalty) to<br /><br />
another operator who is desirous of drilling the tract.<br /><br />
"Finding cost", expressed in dollars per BOE, is<br /><br />
calculated by dividing the amount of total exploration and<br /><br />
development capital expenditures (excluding any amortization<br /><br />
with respect to deferred financing fees) by the amount of<br /><br />
proved reserves added during the same period<br /><br />
(including<br /><br />
the effect on proved reserves of reserve revisions).<br /><br />
"G&amp;A" means general and administrative.<br /><br />
"Gross" natural gas and crude oil wells or "gross"<br /><br />
wells or acres is the number of wells or acres in which the<br /><br />
Company has an interest.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
taxes.<br /><br />
"MBbl" means thousand barrels.<br /><br />
"MBOE" means thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent.<br /><br />

"MMBTU" means million British Thermal Units.<br /><br />
"MMcf" means million cubic feet.<br /><br />
"MMcfpd" means million cubic feet per day.<br /><br />

Company's working interest in such wells or acres.<br /><br />
"NGL" means natural gas liquid.<br /><br />
"Production costs" means lease operating expenses<br /><br />
taxes on natural gas and crude oil production.<br /><br />

wells<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
wells<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"Proved developed reserves" means reserves that can be<br /><br />
expected to be recovered through existing wells<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
existing equipment and operating methods and those reserves<br /><br />
that exist behind the casing of existing wells when the cost<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
making such reserves available for production<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
relatively small compared to the cost of a new well.<br /><br />
"Proved reserves" or "reserves" means the estimated<br /><br />
quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs which<br /><br />
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable<br /><br />
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known<br /><br />
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions,<br /><br />
i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.<br /><br />
Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices<br /><br />
provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on<br /><br />
escalations based upon future conditions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
"Proved undeveloped reserves" means reserves that are<br /><br />
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled<br /><br />
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major<br /><br />
expenditure is required for recompletion.<br /><br />
Reserves on<br /><br />
undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units<br /><br />
offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of<br /><br />
production<br /><br />
when drilled.<br /><br />
Proved reserves<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
other<br /><br />
undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be<br /><br />
demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of<br /><br />
production from the existing productive formation. Under no<br /><br />
circumstances<br /><br />
should estimates for proved<br /><br />
undeveloped<br /><br />
reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an<br /><br />
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery<br /><br />
technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been<br /><br />
proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same<br /><br />
reservoir.<br /><br />
"Service well" is a well used for water injection in<br /><br />
secondary recovery projects or for the disposal of produced<br /><br />
water.<br /><br />
"Undeveloped acreage" means leased acres on which wells<br /><br />
have not been drilled or completed to a point that would<br /><br />
permit the production of commercial quantities of crude oil<br /><br />
and natural gas, regardless whether or not such acreage<br /><br />
contains proved reserves.<br /><br />

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
XCL Ltd.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the<br /><br />
financial statement schedule of XCL Ltd. and Subsidiaries listed<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Index on page F-1.<br /><br />
These consolidated financial<br /><br />
statements<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
financial<br /><br />
statement<br /><br />
schedule<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is<br /><br />
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements<br /><br />
and financial statement schedule based on our audits.<br /><br />
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted<br /><br />
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and<br /><br />
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether<br /><br />
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.<br /><br />
An<br /><br />
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting<br /><br />
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.<br /><br />
An<br /><br />
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and<br /><br />
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating<br /><br />
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that<br /><br />
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.<br /><br />
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above<br /><br />
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated<br /><br />
financial position of XCL Ltd. and Subsidiaries as of December<br /><br />
31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of their<br /><br />
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in<br /><br />
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally<br /><br />
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the<br /><br />
financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered<br /><br />
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken<br /><br />
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the<br /><br />
information required to be included therein.<br /><br />
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been<br /><br />
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going<br /><br />
concern.<br /><br />
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial<br /><br />
statements, the Company is generating minimal revenues and<br /><br />
although the Company has cash (including its restricted cash) in<br /><br />
the amount of approximately $32 million as of December 31, 1997,<br /><br />
and a positive working capital position, it must generate<br /><br />
additional cash flows to satisfy its development and exploratory<br /><br />
obligations with respect to its China properties. There is no<br /><br />
assurance that the Company will be able to generate the necessary<br /><br />
funds to satisfy these contractual obligations and to ultimately<br /><br />
achieve profitable operations, which creates substantial doubt<br /><br />
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements'<br /><br />
plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments<br /><br />
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.<br /><br />

XCL Ltd. and Subsidiaries<br /><br />
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(1)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Principles of Consolidation:<br /><br />
--------------------------The consolidated financial statements include the accounts<br /><br />
of XCL Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries ("XCL" or the<br /><br />
"Company") after the elimination of all significant intercompany<br /><br />
accounts and transactions.<br /><br />
Certain reclassifications have been<br /><br />
made to prior year financial statements to conform to current<br /><br />
year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net<br /><br />
loss, cash flows or shareholders' equity.<br /><br />
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements:<br /><br />
- ----------------------------------------------------------The preparation of the Company's financial statements, in<br /><br />
conformity<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
generally accepted accounting<br /><br />
principles,<br /><br />
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect<br /><br />
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,<br /><br />
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.<br /><br />
Actual<br /><br />
results could differ from those estimates.<br /><br />
Cash and Cash Equivalents:<br /><br />
------------------------The Company considers deposits which can be redeemed on<br /><br />
demand and investments which have original maturities of less<br /><br />
than three months, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were<br /><br />
deposited primarily in three financial institutions.<br /><br />
Concentration of Credit Risk:<br /><br />
---------------------------The Company operates exclusively in the oil and gas industry<br /><br />
and receivables are due from other producers who may be affected<br /><br />
by economic conditions in the industry. The Company has not<br /><br />
experienced any material credit losses.<br /><br />
The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to<br /><br />
concentrations<br /><br />
of credit risk consist primarily<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
cash<br /><br />
equivalents/short-term investments and trade receivables.<br /><br />
The Company believes that no single short-term investment<br /><br />
exposes the Company to significant credit risk. Additionally,<br /><br />
creditworthiness of its counterparties, which are major financial<br /><br />
institutions, are monitored. As of December 31, 1997, the Company<br /><br />
had cash in financial institutions in excess of the insured<br /><br />
amounts.<br /><br />
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:<br /><br />
----------------------------------For the purposes of disclosure requirements pursuant to<br /><br />
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 "Disclosures<br /><br />
About Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments," fair value of<br /><br />
current assets and liabilities approximate carrying value, due to<br /><br />
the short-term nature of these items. The Company believes the<br /><br />
fair value of long-term debt approximates carrying value. Fair<br /><br />
value<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
financial instruments is not<br /><br />
necessarily<br /><br />
representative of the amount that could be realized or settled.<br /><br />
Oil and Gas Properties:<br /><br />
---------------------The Company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and<br /><br />
production activities using the full cost method of accounting.<br /><br />
Accordingly, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration,<br /><br />
and development of oil and gas reserves, including appropriate<br /><br />
related costs, are capitalized. The Company capitalizes internal<br /><br />
costs that can be directly identified with its acquisition,<br /><br />
exploration and development activities and does not capitalize<br /><br />
any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or<br /><br />
similar activities.<br /><br />
The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including<br /><br />
the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are<br /><br />
amortized on the unit-of-production method based on estimates of<br /><br />
proved oil and gas reserves. The Company's domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
<br /><br />
reserves were estimated by Company engineers in 1997 and 1996,<br /><br />
and foreign reserves in 1997 and 1996 by independent petroleum<br /><br />
engineers.<br /><br />
Investments in unproved<br /><br />
properties<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
major<br /><br />
development projects are not amortized until proved reserves<br /><br />
associated with the projects can be determined<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
until<br /><br />
impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that<br /><br />
properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is added to<br /><br />
the capitalized costs to be depleted. The Company capitalizes<br /><br />
interest on expenditures made in connection with exploration and<br /><br />
development<br /><br />
projects<br /><br />
that are<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
subject<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
current<br /><br />
amortization.<br /><br />
Interest is capitalized for the period that<br /><br />
activities are in progress to bring these projects to their<br /><br />
intended use.<br /><br />
During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company decided to<br /><br />
concentrate on the development of its China investments, and<br /><br />
decided to dispose of its domestic properties. Accordingly, the<br /><br />
recorded value of the Company's domestic properties was reduced<br /><br />
to their estimated fair market value and the resulting balances<br /><br />
were transferred to assets held for sale.<br /><br />
The Company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas<br /><br />
properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis, and limits<br /><br />
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties to the present value<br /><br />
of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted<br /><br />
at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved<br /><br />
properties as adjusted for related tax effects and deferred tax<br /><br />
reserves. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is<br /><br />
charged to depreciation, depletion and amortization expense<br /><br />
("DD&amp;A") in the period in which it occurs.<br /><br />
Proceeds from the sale of proved and unproved properties are<br /><br />
accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs with no gain or<br /><br />
loss recognized unless such sales would significantly alter the<br /><br />
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil<br /><br />
and gas. Abandonments of properties are accounted for<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized.<br /><br />
The Company accounts for site restoration, dismantlement and<br /><br />
abandonment costs in its estimated future costs of proved<br /><br />
reserves.<br /><br />
Accordingly, such costs are amortized on a unit of<br /><br />
production basis and reflected with accumulated depreciation,<br /><br />
depletion and amortization. The Company identifies and estimates<br /><br />
such costs based upon its assessment of applicable regulatory<br /><br />
requirements, its operating experience and oil and gas industry<br /><br />
practice in the areas within which its properties are located.<br /><br />
To date the Company has not been required to expend any material<br /><br />
amounts to satisfy such obligations. The Company does not expect<br /><br />
that future costs will have a material adverse effect on the<br /><br />
Company's operations, financial condition or cash flows.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes<br /><br />
a deduction for any such costs.<br /><br />
Other Property and Equipment:<br /><br />
---------------------------Other property and equipment primarily consists of furniture<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
fixtures, equipment and software.<br /><br />
Major renewals and<br /><br />
betterments are capitalized while the costs of repairs and<br /><br />
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.<br /><br />
The costs of<br /><br />
assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the applicable<br /><br />
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the<br /><br />
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.<br /><br />
Other<br /><br />
property and equipment costs are depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which<br /><br />
range from 3 to 15 years.<br /><br />
Capitalized Interest and Amortized Debt Costs:<br /><br />
--------------------------------------------During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, interest and associated<br /><br />
costs of approximately $5.8 million, $2.8 million and $3.1<br /><br />
million, respectively were capitalized on significant investments<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
and gas properties that are not being currently<br /><br />
depreciated, depleted, or amortized and on which exploration or<br /><br />
development activities are in progress.<br /><br />
Deferred debt issue<br /><br />
costs and discount on senior secured notes are amortized on the<br /><br />
straight-line basis over the term of the related debt agreement.<br /><br />
The discount on senior secured notes is the amount attributable<br /><br />
to the detachable Common Stock purchase warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Income Taxes:<br /><br />
-----------The Company accounts for income taxes in compliance with<br /><br />
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS No.<br /><br />
109) "Accounting for Income Taxes." Requirements by this standard<br /><br />
include recognition of future tax benefits, measured by enacted<br /><br />
tax rates, attributable to: deductible temporary differences<br /><br />
between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and<br /><br />
liabilities; and, net operating loss carryforwards.<br /><br />
Recognition<br /><br />
of such tax assets are limited to the extent that realization of<br /><br />
such benefits is able to be reasonably anticipated.<br /><br />
Revenue Recognition:<br /><br />
------------------Oil and gas revenues are recognized using the accrual method<br /><br />
at the price realized as production and delivery occurs. Amounts<br /><br />
which are contingently receivable are not recognized until<br /><br />
realized.<br /><br />
Foreign Operations<br /><br />
-----------------The Company's future operations and earnings will depend<br /><br />
upon the results of the Company's operations in China. There can<br /><br />
be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully<br /><br />
conduct such operations, and a failure to do so would have a<br /><br />
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,<br /><br />
results of operations and cash flows. Also, the success of the<br /><br />
Company's operations will be subject to numerous contingencies,<br /><br />
some<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
are beyond management's<br /><br />
control.<br /><br />
These<br /><br />
contingencies include general and regional economic conditions,<br /><br />
prices for crude oil and natural gas, competition and changes in<br /><br />
regulation.<br /><br />
Since the Company is dependent on international<br /><br />
operations, specifically those in China, the Company will be<br /><br />
subject to various additional political, economic and other<br /><br />
uncertainties. Among other risks, the Company's operations will<br /><br />
be subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds;<br /><br />
export duties, quotas and embargoes; domestic and international<br /><br />
customs and tariffs; and changing taxation policies, foreign<br /><br />
exchange restrictions, political conditions and governmental<br /><br />
regulations.<br /><br />
Stock Based Compensation:<br /><br />
-----------------------Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.<br /><br />
123<br /><br />
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123")<br /><br />
encourages, but does not require companies to record compensation<br /><br />
costs for stock-based compensation plans at fair value.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based<br /><br />
employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed<br /><br />
in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for<br /><br />
Stock Issued to Employees." Accordingly, compensation cost for<br /><br />
stock options, awards and warrants is measured as the excess, if<br /><br />
any, of the quoted market price of the Company's stock at the<br /><br />
date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire<br /><br />
the stock.<br /><br />
Earnings Per Share:<br /><br />
-----------------During 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial<br /><br />
Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No.<br /><br />
128")<br /><br />
and has restated all years presented in accordance<br /><br />
therewith.<br /><br />
SFAS No. 128 requires a dual presentation of basic<br /><br />
and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the<br /><br />
statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income<br /><br />
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number<br /><br />
of common shares for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the<br /><br />
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other<br /><br />
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into<br /><br />
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that<br /><br />
would then share in earnings.<br /><br />
Environmental Expenditures<br /><br />
--------------------------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Environmental expenditures relating to current operations<br /><br />
are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on whether<br /><br />
such expenditures provide future economic benefits. Liabilities<br /><br />
are recognized when the expenditures are considered probable and<br /><br />
can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based<br /><br />
on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
undiscounted<br /><br />
site-specific<br /><br />
costs.<br /><br />
Generally,<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
recognition coincides with the Company's commitment to a formal<br /><br />
plan of action.<br /><br />
Common Stock Reverse Split<br /><br />
-------------------------Effective December 17, 1997, the Company amended and<br /><br />
restated its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-forfifteen reverse split of the Company's Common Stock. All share<br /><br />
amounts presented herein have been adjusted to reflect the<br /><br />
reverse split.<br /><br />
Recent Accounting Pronouncements<br /><br />
-------------------------------In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting<br /><br />
Comprehensive Income", which is effective for the Company's year<br /><br />
ending December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for<br /><br />
the reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its<br /><br />
components.<br /><br />
The Company will be analyzing SFAS No. 130 during<br /><br />
1998 to determine what, if any, additional disclosures will be<br /><br />
required.<br /><br />
In June 1997, the FASB Issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures<br /><br />
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", which<br /><br />
is effective the Company's year ended December 31, 1998.<br /><br />
This<br /><br />
statement establishes standards for reporting of information<br /><br />
about operating segments. The Company will be analyzing SFAS No.<br /><br />
131 during 1998 to determine what, if any, additional disclosures<br /><br />
will be required.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Liquidity and Management's Plan<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company, in connection with its 1995 decision to dispose<br /><br />
of its domestic properties, is generating minimal annual revenues<br /><br />
and is devoting all of its efforts toward the development of its<br /><br />
China properties. Although the Company has cash available in the<br /><br />
amount of approximately $32 million as of December 31, 1997<br /><br />
(including restricted cash of approximately $10 million) and a<br /><br />
positive working capital position, management anticipates that<br /><br />
additional funds will be needed to meet all of its development<br /><br />
and exploratory obligations until sufficient cash flows are<br /><br />
generated from anticipated production to sustain its operations<br /><br />
and to fund future development and exploration obligations.<br /><br />
Management plans to generate the additional cash needed<br /><br />
through the sale or financing of its domestic assets held for<br /><br />
sale and the completion of additional equity, debt or joint<br /><br />
venture transactions. There is no assurance, however, that the<br /><br />
Company will be able to sell or finance its assets held for sale<br /><br />
or to complete other transactions in the future at commercially<br /><br />
reasonable terms, if at all, or that it will be able to meet its<br /><br />
future contractual obligations. If production from the China<br /><br />
properties commences in late 1998 or the first half of 1999, as<br /><br />
anticipated, the Company's proportionate share of the related<br /><br />
cash flow will be available to help satisfy cash requirements.<br /><br />
However, there is likewise no assurance that such development<br /><br />
will be successful and production will commence, and that such<br /><br />
cash flow will be available.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Supplemental Cash Flow Information<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There were no income taxes paid for the years ended December<br /><br />
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.<br /><br />
The Company completed the following noncash transactions in<br /><br />
1997 and prior years in order to conserve cash for use in its<br /><br />
core activities and to meet other obligations while honoring<br /><br />
restrictions on cash use imposed by its bank agreement.<br /><br />
Such<br /><br />

the terms of such warrants to the terms of warrants granted in<br /><br />
the Regulation S unit offering noted above.<br /><br />
As compensation for identifying the placement agent for the<br /><br />
Regulation S unit offering, the finder earned a four percent<br /><br />
stock fee of the gross proceeds of the offering. In payment of<br /><br />
this fee, the Company during the first quarter, issued 17,817<br /><br />
shares<br /><br />
of Common Stock in connection with the initial closing<br /><br />
and during the second quarter issued an aggregate 8,192 shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock as compensation for the subsequent closings.<br /><br />
Effective March 1, 1996, the terms of warrants issued to a<br /><br />

(4)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Receivables<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company's trade accounts receivable at December 31,<br /><br />
1997, arise primarily from business transactions with entities in<br /><br />
the oil and gas industry, mostly located in Texas. An oil and gas<br /><br />
purchaser with which the Company has contractual arrangements<br /><br />
accounted for approximately 76 percent of oil and gas revenue<br /><br />
receivables in 1997, 76 percent in 1996 and 67 percent in 1995.<br /><br />
(5)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Assets Held for Sale and Investments<br /><br />
Assets Held for Sale<br /><br />
-------------------Domestic Oil and Gas Properties<br /><br />
--------------------------------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During 1996, the Company was engaged in attempts to sell its<br /><br />
remaining domestic oil and gas properties and had a contract in<br /><br />
place for the sale of the property. Prior to the sale being<br /><br />
consummated, the Company received service of three lawsuits filed<br /><br />
by lessors of the most productive remaining leases, effectively<br /><br />
thwarting the Company's ability to consummate the sale by casting<br /><br />
doubt as to the Company's rights to certain interests in the<br /><br />
leases and demanding damages. While the Company believes that<br /><br />
the charges are without merit, it is of the opinion that the<br /><br />
property cannot be sold until such time as the litigation is<br /><br />
concluded or settled. In response to a request by the lessors'<br /><br />
counsel, the Company has granted the lessors an extension of time<br /><br />
to respond to discovery demands made by the Company and to allow<br /><br />
sufficient time to pursue settlement of this litigation (see Note<br /><br />
11).<br /><br />
As a result of these lawsuits the Company took an<br /><br />
additional writedown of these properties aggregating<br /><br />
$3.85<br /><br />
million during 1996.<br /><br />
Lutcher Moore Tract<br /><br />
------------------During 1993, the Company completed the acquisition of a<br /><br />
group of corporations which together owned 100 percent of an<br /><br />
unevaluated 62,500-acre tract in southeastern Louisiana (the<br /><br />
"Lutcher Moore Tract"). This property is pledged as collateral<br /><br />
for the Lutcher Moore limited recourse debt (see Note 6).<br /><br />
This<br /><br />
property is being held for sale.<br /><br />
Investments<br /><br />
- ----------Lube Oil Investment<br /><br />
-------------------On<br /><br />
<br /><br />
July 17, 1995, the Company signed a contract with<br /><br />
<br /><br />
CNPC<br /><br />
<br /><br />
United Lube Oil Corporation to form a joint venture company to<br /><br />
engage in the manufacturing, distribution and marketing of<br /><br />
lubricating oil in China and southeast Asian markets. As of<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, the Company has invested approximately $3.3<br /><br />
million in the project.<br /><br />
Coalbed Methane Project<br /><br />
----------------------During 1995, the Company signed an agreement with the China<br /><br />
National Administration of Coal Geology, pursuant to which the<br /><br />
parties have commenced cooperation for the exploration and<br /><br />
development of coalbed methane in two areas in China. As of<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, the Company has invested approximately $0.6<br /><br />
million in the project.<br /><br />

Substantially all of the Company's assets collateralize<br /><br />
these borrowings.<br /><br />
Accounts payable and accrued costs include<br /><br />
accrued interest at December 31, 1997 and 1996 of $1.8 million<br /><br />
and $1.5 million, respectively.<br /><br />
Senior Secured Notes<br /><br />
-------------------On May 20, 1997, the Company sold in an unregistered<br /><br />
offering<br /><br />
to qualified institutional buyers and<br /><br />
accredited<br /><br />
institutional investors (the "Note Offering") 75,000 Note Units,<br /><br />
each consisting of $1,000 principal amount of 13.5% Senior<br /><br />
Secured Notes due May 1, 2004 (collectively, the "Notes") and one<br /><br />
Common Stock Purchase Warrant (collectively the "Note Warrants")<br /><br />
to purchase 85 shares of the Company's common stock, par value<br /><br />
$0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), at an exercise price of<br /><br />
$3.09 per share, first exercisable after May 20, 1998.<br /><br />
Total<br /><br />
funds received of $75 million were allocated, $15 million to the<br /><br />
Note Warrants and $60 million to the Notes. The value allocated<br /><br />
to the Note Warrants is being amortized to interest expense over<br /><br />
the term of the Notes. At December 31, 1997, the unamortized<br /><br />
discount on the Notes is approximately $13.7 million.<br /><br />
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and<br /><br />
November 1, commencing November 1, 1997. The Notes will mature<br /><br />
on May 1, 2004. The Notes are not redeemable at the option of the<br /><br />
Company prior to May 1, 2002, except that the Company may redeem,<br /><br />
at its option prior to May 1, 2002, up to 35% of the original<br /><br />
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, at a redemption price of<br /><br />
113.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption,<br /><br />
with the net proceeds of any equity offering completed within 90<br /><br />
days prior to such redemption; provided that at least $48.75<br /><br />
million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain<br /><br />
outstanding.<br /><br />
On or after May 1, 2002, the Notes are redeemable<br /><br />
at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at an initial<br /><br />
redemption price of 106.75% of the aggregate principal amount of<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the Notes until May 1, 2003, and at par thereafter, plus accrued<br /><br />
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Upon the<br /><br />
occurrence of a change of control, as defined, the Company will<br /><br />
be obligated to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes<br /><br />
at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.<br /><br />
Total interest expense incurred on the Notes was approximately<br /><br />
$6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.<br /><br />
The Senior Secured Notes restrict, among other things, the<br /><br />
Company's ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay<br /><br />
dividends, or make certain other restricted payments.<br /><br />
It also<br /><br />
limits the Company's ability to consummate certain asset sales,<br /><br />
enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into<br /><br />
mergers or consolidations, or dispose of substantially all the<br /><br />
Company's assets. The Company's ability to comply with such<br /><br />
covenants may be affected by events beyond its control. The<br /><br />
breach of any of these covenants could result in a default.<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
default could allow holders of the Notes to declare all amounts<br /><br />
outstanding and accrued interest immediately due and payable.<br /><br />
Absent such payment, the holders could proceed against any<br /><br />
collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which<br /><br />
includes all of the stock of the Company's principal operating<br /><br />
subsidiary, XCL-China, which has guaranteed such indebtedness. A<br /><br />
foreclosure on the stock of XCL China could trigger Apache's<br /><br />
right of first refusal under the Participation Agreement to<br /><br />
purchase such stock or its option to purchase the Company's<br /><br />
interest in the Contract. There can be no assurance that the<br /><br />
assets of the Company and XCL-China (a "Subsidiary Guarantor"),<br /><br />
or any other Subsidiary Guarantors would be sufficient to fully<br /><br />
repay the Notes and the Company's other indebtedness.<br /><br />

-------------------------------On May 20, 1997, the Company sold, in an unregistered<br /><br />
offering<br /><br />
to qualified institutional buyers and<br /><br />
accredited<br /><br />
institutional investors (the "Equity Offering") 294,118 Equity<br /><br />
Units, each consisting of one share of Amended Series A,<br /><br />
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share<br /><br />
("Amended Series A Preferred Stock"), and one Common Stock<br /><br />

Dividends on the Amended Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative<br /><br />
from May 20, 1997 and are payable semi-annually, commencing<br /><br />
November 1, 1997, at an annual rate of $8.075 per share.<br /><br />

2000, and thereafter in cash, or at the election of the Company,<br /><br />
in additional shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into Common<br /><br />
Stock, at any time after the first anniversary of the issue date,<br /><br />
at the option of the holders thereof, unless previously redeemed,<br /><br />
at an initial conversion price of $7.50 per share of Common Stock<br /><br />
(equivalent to a rate of 11 shares of Common Stock for each share<br /><br />
of Amended Series A Preferred Stock), subject to adjustment under<br /><br />
certain<br /><br />
conditions.<br /><br />
The Company is entitled<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
require<br /><br />
conversion of all the outstanding shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock, at any time after November 20, 1997 if the<br /><br />
Common Stock shall have traded for 20 trading days during any 30<br /><br />
consecutive trading day period at a market value equal to or<br /><br />
greater than 150% of the prevailing conversion rate.<br /><br />
The Amended Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at any<br /><br />
time on or after May 1, 2002, in whole or in part, at the option<br /><br />
of the Company initially at a redemption price of $90.00 per<br /><br />
share and thereafter at redemption prices which decrease ratably<br /><br />
annually to $85.00 per share on and after May 1, 2006, plus<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable, in whole, on<br /><br />
May 1, 2007, at a redemption price of $85.00 per share, plus<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date, payable in<br /><br />
cash, or at the election of the Company, in Common Stock.<br /><br />
Upon the occurrence of a change in control or certain other<br /><br />
fundamental changes, the conversion price of the Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock will be reduced, for a limited period, in certain<br /><br />
circumstances in order to provide holders with loss protection at<br /><br />
a time when the market value of the Common Stock is less than the<br /><br />
then prevailing conversion price.<br /><br />
The Amended Series A Preferred Stock will entitle the holder<br /><br />
thereof to cast the same number of votes as the shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock then issuable upon conversion thereof on any matter subject<br /><br />
to the vote of the holders of the Common Stock. Further, the<br /><br />
holders of the Amended Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled<br /><br />
to vote as a separate class (i) to elect two directors if the<br /><br />
Company is in arrears in payment of three semi-annual dividends,<br /><br />
and (ii) the approval of two-thirds of the then outstanding<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock will be required for the<br /><br />
issuance of any class or series of stock ranking prior to the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock, as to dividends, liquidation<br /><br />
rights and for certain amendments to the Company's Certificate of<br /><br />
Incorporation that adversely affect the rights of holders of the<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Effective November 10, 1997, by consent of in excess of 88<br /><br />
percent of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
such series of preferred stock was amended, reclassified and<br /><br />
converted to Amended Series A Preferred Stock. As a consequence<br /><br />
of such consent all dividend arrearages, and accrued and unpaid<br /><br />
dividends were paid in additional shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
This amendment resulted in approximately<br /><br />
726,907 shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock being issued<br /><br />
in respect of such reclassification and payment of dividends.<br /><br />
Effective November 10, 1997, by consent of in excess of 67<br /><br />
percent of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock such series<br /><br />
of preferred stock was amended, reclassified and converted to<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock. As a consequence of such<br /><br />
consent all accrued and unpaid dividends were paid in additional<br /><br />
shares of Amended Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
This amendment<br /><br />
resulted in approximately 63,706 shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock being issued in respect of such reclassification<br /><br />
and payment of dividends.<br /><br />
Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
-----------------------The Series B, Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par<br /><br />
value $1.00 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock") bears a<br /><br />
cumulative fixed dividend at an annual rate of $10 per share,<br /><br />
payable semiannually, and is entitled to 50 votes per share on<br /><br />
all matters on which Common Stockholders are entitled to vote and<br /><br />
separately as a class on certain matters; ranks senior to the<br /><br />
Common Stock and pari passu with the Amended Series A and Series<br /><br />
F Preferred Stocks of the Company with respect to the payment of<br /><br />
dividends and distributions on liquidation; and has a liquidation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
preference of $100 per share plus accumulated dividends.<br /><br />
On May 16, 1995, the Company received notice from the Series<br /><br />
B Preferred holder exercising its redemption rights. The Company<br /><br />
elected to redeem in shares of Common Stock and the holder<br /><br />
exercised its option to have the Company sell its shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock.<br /><br />
The aggregate redemption price was $5 million,<br /><br />
plus accrued dividends from January 1, 1995 to the date of<br /><br />
redemption. Approximately 5,535 shares had been redeemed at<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, from the sale of approximately 353,333 shares<br /><br />
of Common Stock. In July 1997, the holder of the Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock sued the Company and each of its directors with<br /><br />
respect to the alleged failure of the Company to redeem the<br /><br />
Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the<br /><br />
Purchase Agreement and Certificate of Designation. In settlement<br /><br />
of that lawsuit in March 1998, the holder of the Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock revoked and withdrew its redemption notice and<br /><br />
sold its shares of Series B Preferred Stock and accompanying<br /><br />
warrants.<br /><br />
The purchasers exchanged the stock and warrants for<br /><br />
44,465 shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock and warrants to<br /><br />
purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of<br /><br />
$5.50 per share, subject to adjustment, expiring March 2, 2002,<br /><br />
and received 2,620 shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock in<br /><br />
payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Each share of Amended Series B Preferred Stock has a<br /><br />
liquidation value of $100, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.<br /><br />
Dividends on the Amended Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative<br /><br />
from March 3, 1998 and are payable semi-annually on June 30 and<br /><br />
December 31 of each year, at an annual rate of $9.50 per share if<br /><br />
paid in cash. In lieu of payment in cash, the Company may, at<br /><br />
its option, elect to pay any dividend in kind in shares of either<br /><br />
Common Stock or Amended Series B Preferred Stock at the option<br /><br />
of the holder. If such dividend is paid in shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series B Preferred Stock, the dividend will be 0.0475 shares of<br /><br />
dividend stock per share of Amended Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
held.<br /><br />
If the dividend is paid in shares of Common Stock, the<br /><br />
dividend shall equal the number of shares of Common Stock equal<br /><br />
to the quotient obtained by dividing $4.75 by the lowest average<br /><br />
closing price per share of Common Stock as calculated for the<br /><br />
last 5, 10 and 30 trading days preceding the dividend payment<br /><br />
date.<br /><br />
Fractional shares will be paid in cash or aggregated and<br /><br />
sold on behalf of the holders. The Amended Series B Preferred<br /><br />
Stock is convertible into Common Stock, at any time after the<br /><br />
earlier of the effective date of the registration of such Common<br /><br />
Stock or August 31, 1998.<br /><br />
Series F Preferred Stock<br /><br />
-----------------------In January 1998, the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock<br /><br />
approved an amendment to the "forced conversion" terms of the<br /><br />
Series F Preferred Stock. Effective January 16, 1998, the<br /><br />
Company forced conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock and an<br /><br />
aggregate of 633,893 shares of Common Stock were issued upon<br /><br />
conversion and in payment of accrued and unpaid dividends.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
consideration for such amendment the holders of the Series F<br /><br />
Preferred Stock were issued warrants to acquire an aggregate of<br /><br />
153,332 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per<br /><br />
share.<br /><br />
Dividends<br /><br />
--------Prior to November 1997, dividends with respect to the Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock were in arrearage. Effective November 10, 1997,<br /><br />
the Series A Preferred Stock was amended, reclassified and<br /><br />
converted to Amended Series A Preferred Stock. As a consequence<br /><br />
of such consent all dividend arrearages, and accrued and unpaid<br /><br />
dividends were paid in additional shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Dividends during 1997 and 1996 on the Series B Preferred<br /><br />
Stock were paid from proceeds of sales of redemption stock, which<br /><br />
were applied first to accrued dividend then the redemption of<br /><br />
shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On March 3, 1998, all<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock were<br /><br />
paid in shares of Amended Series B Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During 1996, the Company issued 2,218 shares of Series E<br /><br />
Preferred Stock in payment of the June 1996 dividends payable on<br /><br />
the Series E Preferred Stock. During 1997, the Company issued<br /><br />
5,261 shares of Series E Preferred Stock in payment of the<br /><br />
December 31, 1996 and June 30, 1997 dividends on the Series E<br /><br />
Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Effective November 10, 1997, the Series E<br /><br />
Preferred Stock was amended, reclassified and converted to<br /><br />
Amended Series A Preferred Stock. As a consequence of such<br /><br />
consent all dividend arrearages, and accrued and unpaid dividends<br /><br />
were paid in additional shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
During 1997, the Company issued 1,261 shares of Series F<br /><br />
Preferred Stock in payment of the June 30, 1997 dividends payable<br /><br />
on the Series F Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
On November 3, 1997, 12,906 shares of Amended Series A<br /><br />
Preferred Stock were issued in respect of the dividend payable<br /><br />
November 1, 1997, in the amount of $1.1 million. Upon conversion<br /><br />
of the Series A and Series E Preferred Stocks into Amended Series<br /><br />
A Preferred Stock, approximately $9.23 in accrued and unpaid<br /><br />
dividends on Series A Preferred Stock and approximately $0.2 in<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock were<br /><br />
paid through the issuance of 790,613 additional shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
Common Stock<br /><br />

During November 1996, the Company offered a holder of<br /><br />
136,000 warrants exercisable at $5.25 per share a reduction in<br /><br />
the exercise price of such warrants to $1.875 per share in<br /><br />
exchange for the immediate exercise of such warrants and the<br /><br />
issuance of a like number of new warrants. In January 1997,<br /><br />
136,000 shares of Common Stock were issued upon the exercise of<br /><br />
the warrants and 136,000 new warrants were issued, exercisable at<br /><br />
$1.875 per share. The Company received $255,000 upon exercise of<br /><br />
these warrants.<br /><br />
During February 1997, the Company offered to reduce the<br /><br />
exercise price on a total of 368,000 warrants issued<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
connection with Regulation S offerings in December 1995 and March<br /><br />
1996, in exchange for their immediate exercise. The offer was<br /><br />
made to reduce the warrant price from $3.75 to $3.30 per share.<br /><br />
One holder of 176,000 warrants accepted the offer and exercised<br /><br />
all 176,000 warrants for which the Company received net proceeds<br /><br />
of $555,400.<br /><br />
The Placement Agent agreed to accept $0.15 per<br /><br />
share rather than 8% of the exercise price as required under the<br /><br />
Placement Agent Agreement.<br /><br />
During April 1997, the Company issued an aggregate of<br /><br />
200,000 shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of warrants at<br /><br />
$1.875 per share and received an aggregate of $375,000 upon<br /><br />
exercise of such warrants.<br /><br />
During August and October 1997, the Company issued an<br /><br />
aggregate of 100,000 shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of<br /><br />
warrants at $2.8125 per share and received proceeds of $281,250<br /><br />

The effect of 33,902,036, 5,103,082 and 4,398,380 shares of<br /><br />
potential common stock were anti-dilutive in 1997, 1996 and 1995,<br /><br />
respectively, due to the losses in all three years.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Income Taxes<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company has significant loss carryforwards which have<br /><br />
been recorded as deferred tax assets. Due to realization of such<br /><br />
amounts being deemed uncertain with respect to the provisions of<br /><br />
SFAS No. 109, a valuation allowance has been recorded for the<br /><br />
entire amount.<br /><br />
The significant components of the net deferred tax expense<br /><br />
(benefit) for 1997 and 1996, were as follows (000's):<br /><br />

At December 31, 1997, the Company had net operating loss<br /><br />
carryforwards for tax purposes in the approximate amount of $174<br /><br />
million which are scheduled to expire by the year<br /><br />
2012.<br /><br />
Additionally, the Company has available acquired net operating<br /><br />
loss carryforwards, in the approximate amount of $9 million,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
which are scheduled to expire by the year 2000, and which are<br /><br />
available to offset taxable income of an acquired subsidiary. Use<br /><br />
of the net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations<br /><br />
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.<br /><br />
At December 31, 1997, the Company had alternative minimum<br /><br />
tax net operating loss carryforwards in the approximate amount of<br /><br />
$114 million which are scheduled to expire by the year 2012.<br /><br />
Additionally, the Company has acquired alternative minimum tax<br /><br />
net operating loss carryforwards in the approximate amount of $12<br /><br />
million which are scheduled to expire by the year 2000, and which<br /><br />
are available for use by an acquired subsidiary.<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
also has $1.0 million of general business credit carryforwards<br /><br />
which are available until the year 2000 to offset future tax<br /><br />
liabilities of an acquired subsidiary. The Company also has<br /><br />
deferred<br /><br />
costs associated with its Chinese operations<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
approximately $13 million. The costs will be amortized and<br /><br />
deducted for Chinese tax purposes when the Company generates<br /><br />
revenue from its Chinese operations.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Stock Option Plans<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company's stock option plans, administered by the<br /><br />
compensation committee, provide for the issuance of incentive and<br /><br />
nonqualified stock options. Under these plans the Company is<br /><br />
authorized to grant options to selected employees, directors and<br /><br />
consultants to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock at<br /><br />
an exercise price (for the Company's incentive stock options) of<br /><br />
not less than the market value at the time such options are<br /><br />
granted and are accounted for in accordance with Accounting<br /><br />
Principles Board Opinion No. 25. In June 1992, the shareholders<br /><br />
of the Company approved the adoption of the Company's Long-Term<br /><br />
Stock Incentive Plan ("LTSIP") under which the Company is<br /><br />
authorized to issue an aggregate of 16.5 million shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock pursuant to future awards granted thereunder.<br /><br />
In December 1997, the shareholders of the Company approved<br /><br />
the amendment and restatement of the Company's LTSIP, effective<br /><br />
as of June 1, 1997, (i) increasing the number of shares issuable<br /><br />
under the LTSIP by 4 million (post-split) shares of Common Stock,<br /><br />
(ii) authorizing 200,000 shares of preferred stock for issuance<br /><br />
under the LTSIP, and (iii) ratifying certain grants of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards to certain<br /><br />
officers and directors of the Company. The LTSIP, as amended and<br /><br />
restated, also allows for the grant of appreciation option<br /><br />
awards. A grant of an appreciation option award to Mr. Miller was<br /><br />
ratified at that same meeting.<br /><br />
All of the restricted stock awards entitle the participants<br /><br />
to full dividend and voting rights and are restricted as to<br /><br />
disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain conditions.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
shares become unrestricted upon attainment of certain<br /><br />
increases in the market price of the Company's Common Stock<br /><br />
within four years from date of grant, as provided for in the<br /><br />
plan.<br /><br />
Upon issuance of restricted shares, unearned compensation<br /><br />
is charged to shareholders' equity for the cost of restricted<br /><br />
stock and recognized as expense ratably over the earned period,<br /><br />
as applicable. The amount recognized for 1997 was not material<br /><br />
because the measurement date was December 17, 1997.<br /><br />
The appreciation option awarded to the Chairman provides him<br /><br />
with the right upon his payment of the exercise price (20% of<br /><br />
amount entitled to receive) to additional compensation payable in<br /><br />
cash or in shares of Common Stock based upon 5% of the difference<br /><br />
between the market capitalization (as defined) of the Company as<br /><br />
of June 1, 1997, and the date the option is exercised (no earlier<br /><br />
than June 1, 2002). Because the option contemplates compensation<br /><br />
determined<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
reference to<br /><br />
increases<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
market<br /><br />
capitalization without restriction, there is no effective limit<br /><br />
on<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
amount of compensation which may become<br /><br />
payable<br /><br />
thereunder. Deferred compensation of $3.2 million was recorded in<br /><br />
connection with the appreciation option and is being amortized<br /><br />
over the service period. The appreciation option expires on June<br /><br />
1,<br /><br />
2007.<br /><br />
Compensation expense recognized<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
1997<br /><br />
was<br /><br />
approximately $373,000.<br /><br />
Non-qualified options granted on June 1, 1997 for an option<br /><br />
price of $3.75 per share resulted in compensation expense for<br /><br />
1997 of $481,000.<br /><br />
The measurement date was established on<br /><br />
December 17, 1997, the date of shareholder approval.<br /><br />

Due to uncertainties in these estimates, such as market prices,<br /><br />

Employee Benefit and Incentive Compensation Plans<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In 1989, the Company adopted an employee benefit plan under<br /><br />
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the benefit of<br /><br />
employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The Company<br /><br />
has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal<br /><br />
Revenue Service regarding the tax favored status of the 401(k)<br /><br />
plan. Employees can contribute up to 10 percent of their<br /><br />
compensation.<br /><br />
The Company, at its discretion and subject to<br /><br />
certain limitations, may contribute up to 75 percent of the<br /><br />
amount contributed by each participant. There were no Company<br /><br />
contributions in 1997, 1996 or 1995.<br /><br />
(11)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Commitments and Contingencies<br /><br />
Other commitments and contingencies include:<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company acquired the rights to the exploration,<br /><br />
development and production of the Zhao Dong Block by executing a<br /><br />
Production Sharing Agreement with CNODC in February 1993. Under<br /><br />
the terms of the Production Sharing Agreement, the Company and<br /><br />
its partner are responsible for all exploration costs. If a<br /><br />
commercial discovery is made, and if CNODC exercises its option<br /><br />
to participate in the development of the field, all development<br /><br />
and operating costs and related oil and gas production will be<br /><br />
shared up to 51 percent by CNODC and the remainder by the<br /><br />
Company and its partner.<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement includes the following<br /><br />
additional principal terms:<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement is basically divided<br /><br />
into<br /><br />
three periods: the Exploration period,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Development period and the Production period. Work to<br /><br />
be performed and expenditures to be incurred during the<br /><br />
Exploration period, which consists of three phases<br /><br />
totaling seven years from May 1, 1993, are<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
exclusive responsibility of the Contractor (the Company<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
its<br /><br />
partner as a group). The<br /><br />
Contractor's<br /><br />
obligations in the three exploration phases are as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the first three years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill three wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $6 million. These obligations have<br /><br />
been met.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the next two years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill two wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $4 million (The Contractor has<br /><br />
elected to proceed with the second phase of the<br /><br />
Contract.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
seismic<br /><br />
data<br /><br />
acquisition<br /><br />
requirement<br /><br />

satisfied.)<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
field covered by the Contract (the "Contract<br /><br />
Area") will be 15 consecutive years (each of 12<br /><br />
months), commencing for each such field on the<br /><br />
date of commencement of commercial production (as<br /><br />
determined under the terms of the Contract).<br /><br />
However, prior to the Production Period, and<br /><br />
during the Development Period, oil and/or gas may<br /><br />
be produced and sold during a long-term testing<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement may be terminated by<br /><br />
Contractor at the end of each phase of the Exploration<br /><br />
period, without further obligation.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company is in dispute over a 1992 tax assessment by the<br /><br />
Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation for the years 1987<br /><br />
through 1991 in the approximate amount of $2.5 million. The<br /><br />
Company has also received a proposed assessment from the<br /><br />
Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation for income tax years<br /><br />
1991 and 1992, and franchise tax years 1992 through 1996 in the<br /><br />
approximate amount of $3.0 million. The Company has filed written<br /><br />
protests as to these proposed assessments, and will vigorously<br /><br />
contest the asserted deficiencies through the administrative<br /><br />
appeals process and, if necessary, litigation. The Company<br /><br />
believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial<br /><br />
statements for any liability.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On July 26, 1996, an individual filed three lawsuits against<br /><br />
a wholly owned subsidiary with respect to oil and gas properties<br /><br />
held for sale. One suit alleges actual damage of $580,000 plus<br /><br />
additional amounts that could result from an accounting of a<br /><br />
pooled interest. Another seeks legal and related expenses of<br /><br />
$56,473 from an allegation the plaintiff was not adequately<br /><br />
represented before the Texas Railroad Commission. The third suit<br /><br />
seeks a declaratory judgement that a pooling of a 1938 lease and<br /><br />
another in 1985 should be declared terminated and further<br /><br />
plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $1 million to effect<br /><br />
environmental restoration. The Company believes these claims are<br /><br />
without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings which<br /><br />
arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of<br /><br />
Management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to<br /><br />
these actions will not materially affect the financial position<br /><br />
of the Company or results of operations of the Company.<br /><br />

The capitalized costs for the foreign properties represent<br /><br />
cumulative expenditures related to the Zhao Dong Block Production<br /><br />
Sharing Agreement and will not be depreciated, depleted or<br /><br />
amortized until production is achieved.<br /><br />
The Company's investment in oil and gas properties as of<br /><br />
December 31, 1997, includes proved and unevaluated properties<br /><br />
which have been excluded from amortization. Such costs will be<br /><br />
evaluated in future periods based on management's assessment of<br /><br />
exploration activities, expiration dates of licenses, permits and<br /><br />
concessions, changes in economic conditions and other factors. As<br /><br />
these properties become evaluated or developed, their cost and<br /><br />
related estimated future revenue will be included in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
calculation of the DD&amp;A rate. Such costs were incurred<br /><br />

The revisions in the Company's estimated quantities of gas<br /><br />
oil are attributable to revised estimates by Company<br /><br />
<br /><br />
engineers<br /><br />
in 1995.<br /><br />
For fiscal 1995 significant<br /><br />
downward<br /><br />
revisions were attributed to the Company's interest in the Cox<br /><br />
Field in Texas due largely to performance of producing wells.<br /><br />
Supplementary Information (Unaudited)<br /><br />
The supplementary information set forth below presents<br /><br />
estimates of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and<br /><br />
gas reserves and changes in such estimates. This information has<br /><br />
been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed by the<br /><br />
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).<br /><br />
Inherent in the<br /><br />
underlying calculations of such data are many variables and<br /><br />
assumptions, the most significant of which are briefly described<br /><br />
below:<br /><br />
Future cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves were<br /><br />
computed on the basis of (a) contractual prices for oil and gas including escalations for gas - in effect at year-end, or (b) in<br /><br />
the case of properties being commercially developed but not<br /><br />
covered by contracts, the estimated market price for gas and the<br /><br />
posted price for oil in effect at year-end.<br /><br />
Probable and<br /><br />
possible reserves - a portion of which, experience has indicated,<br /><br />
generally become proved once further development work has been<br /><br />
conducted - are not considered. Additionally, estimated future<br /><br />
cash flows are dependent upon the assumed quantities of oil and<br /><br />
gas delivered and purchased from the Company. Such deliverability<br /><br />
estimates are highly complex and are not only based on the<br /><br />
physical<br /><br />
characteristics of a property but<br /><br />
also<br /><br />
include<br /><br />
assumptions relative to purchaser demand. Future prices actually<br /><br />
received may differ from the estimates in the standardized<br /><br />
measure.<br /><br />
Future net cash flows have been reduced by applicable<br /><br />
estimated<br /><br />
operating<br /><br />
costs, production<br /><br />
taxes<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
future<br /><br />
development costs, all of which are based on current costs.<br /><br />
Future net cash flows are further reduced by future income<br /><br />
taxes which are calculated by applying the statutory federal<br /><br />
income tax rate to pretax future net cash flows after utilization<br /><br />
of available tax carryforwards.<br /><br />
To reflect the estimated timing of future net cash flows,<br /><br />
such amounts have been discounted by the Securities and Exchange<br /><br />
Commission prescribed annual rate of 10 percent.<br /><br />
In view of the uncertainties inherent in developing this<br /><br />
supplementary information, it is emphasized that the information<br /><br />
represents approximate amounts which may be imprecise and extreme<br /><br />
caution should accompany its use and interpretation.<br /><br />
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related<br /><br />
to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves<br /><br />
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows<br /><br />
from proved oil and gas reserves, determined in accordance with<br /><br />
rules prescribed by FASB No. 69 is summarized below, and does not<br /><br />
purport to present the fair market value of the Company's oil and<br /><br />
gas assets, but does present the present value of estimated<br /><br />
future cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.:<br /><br />
The Company previously excluded from this table, the effect of<br /><br />
income taxes because it believed it had a tax holiday in China.<br /><br />
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company determined that it<br /><br />
would be subject to future income taxes at the maximum rate of<br /><br />
33% in China. Accordingly, the table below has been revised to<br /><br />
include estimates of such income taxes.<br /><br />

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br /><br />
June 30, 1998<br /><br />
(1)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Basis of Presentation<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The consolidated financial statements at June 30, 1998, and<br /><br />
for the six months then ended have been prepared by the Company,<br /><br />
without audit, pursuant to the Rules and Regulations of the<br /><br />
Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and<br /><br />
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements<br /><br />
prepared<br /><br />
in accordance with generally accepted<br /><br />
accounting<br /><br />
principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such Rules<br /><br />
and Regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures are<br /><br />
adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading.<br /><br />
These consolidated financial statements should be read<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto<br /><br />
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year<br /><br />
ended December 31, 1997. In the opinion of management, all<br /><br />
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,<br /><br />
necessary to present fairly the financial position of XCL Ltd.<br /><br />
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1998, and 1997, and the results<br /><br />
of their operations for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and<br /><br />
1997, have been included. Certain reclassifications have been<br /><br />
made to prior period financial statements to conform to current<br /><br />
year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net<br /><br />
loss or shareholders' equity. The results of the Company's<br /><br />
operations<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
such interim periods are not<br /><br />
necessarily<br /><br />
indicative of the results for the full year.<br /><br />
Revenues and operating expenses associated with oil and gas<br /><br />
properties<br /><br />
held<br /><br />
for sale have become<br /><br />
insignificant<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
accordingly, are recorded in other costs and operating expenses<br /><br />
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.<br /><br />
(2)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Liquidity and Capital Resources<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company, since its decision in 1995 to dispose of its<br /><br />
domestic properties, has generated minimal annual revenues and is<br /><br />
now devoting all of its efforts toward the development of its<br /><br />
China properties. Although the Company has cash available in the<br /><br />
amount of approximately $16.6 million at June 30, 1998 (including<br /><br />
restricted cash of approximately $5.2 million to pay interest due<br /><br />
November 1, 1998) and a positive working capital position,<br /><br />
additional funds will be needed to meet the Company's working<br /><br />
capital requirements and capital expenditure obligations until<br /><br />
sufficient cash flows are generated from anticipated production<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
sustain its operations and to fund future development<br /><br />
obligations.<br /><br />
Management plans to generate the additional cash needed<br /><br />
through the sale or financing of its domestic oil and gas<br /><br />
properties assets held for sale and investment in land and the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
completion<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
additional equity, debt or<br /><br />
joint<br /><br />
venture<br /><br />
transactions. There is no assurance, however, that the Company<br /><br />
will be able to sell or finance its oil and gas properties held<br /><br />
for sale or investment in land or to complete other transactions<br /><br />
in the future at commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or<br /><br />
that it will be able to meet its future contractual obligations.<br /><br />
If production from the China properties commences in late 1998 or<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
first<br /><br />
half of 1999, as anticipated,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company's<br /><br />
proportionate share of the cash flow will be available to<br /><br />
partially satisfy its cash requirements.<br /><br />
However, there is<br /><br />
likewise no assurance that such development will be successful<br /><br />
and production will commence as anticipated, and that such cash<br /><br />
flow will be available or sufficient.<br /><br />
(3)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Supplemental Cash Flow Information<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There were no income taxes paid during<br /><br />
periods ended June 30, 1998 and 1997.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
six<br /><br />
<br /><br />
months<br /><br />
<br /><br />

On May 1, 1998, an interest payment in the amount of $5.3<br /><br />
million was made to the holders of the senior secured notes for<br /><br />
the interest period November 1, 1997 through May 1, 1998.<br /><br />
(4)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Debt<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As of June<br /><br />
(000's):<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Commitments and Contingencies<br /><br />
Other commitments and contingencies include:<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company acquired the rights to the exploration,<br /><br />
development and production of the Zhao Dong Block by executing a<br /><br />
Production Sharing Agreement (the "Agreement") with CNODC in<br /><br />
February 1993. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company and<br /><br />
its partner are responsible for all exploration costs. If a<br /><br />
commercial discovery is made, and if CNODC exercises its option<br /><br />
to participate in the development of the field, all development<br /><br />
and operating costs and related oil and gas production will be<br /><br />
shared up to 51 percent by CNODC and the remainder by the Company<br /><br />
and its partner.<br /><br />
The Agreement includes the following additional<br /><br />
principal terms:<br /><br />
The Agreement is basically divided into three periods:<br /><br />
the Exploration period, the Development period and the<br /><br />
Production<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
Work to<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
performed<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
expenditures to be incurred during the Exploration<br /><br />
period, which consists of three phases totaling seven<br /><br />
years<br /><br />
from<br /><br />
May<br /><br />
1,<br /><br />
1993,<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
exclusive<br /><br />
responsibility of the Company and its partner as a<br /><br />
group (the "Contractor"). The Contractor's obligations<br /><br />
in the three exploration phases are as follows:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the first three years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill three wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $6 million. These obligations have<br /><br />
been met.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the next two years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill two wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $4 million. (The Contractor has<br /><br />
elected to proceed with the second phase of the<br /><br />
Agreement.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
seismic<br /><br />
data<br /><br />
acquisition<br /><br />
requirement<br /><br />
for the second phase<br /><br />
has<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
satisfied.)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the last two years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill two wildcat wells and expend a<br /><br />
minimum of $4 million.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Production Period for any oil and/or gas<br /><br />
field<br /><br />
covered by the Agreement will be<br /><br />
15<br /><br />
consecutive years (each of 12 months), commencing<br /><br />
for each such field on the date of commencement of<br /><br />
commercial production (as determined under the<br /><br />
terms of the Agreement). However, prior to the<br /><br />
Production Period, and during the Development<br /><br />
Period, oil and/or gas may be produced and sold<br /><br />
during a long-term testing period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Agreement may be terminated by the Contractor at the end<br /><br />
of each phase of the Exploration period, without<br /><br />
further obligation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(8)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company is in dispute over a 1992 tax assessment by the<br /><br />
Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation for the years 1987<br /><br />
through 1991 in the approximate amount of $2.5 million. The<br /><br />
Company has also received a proposed assessment from the<br /><br />
Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation for income tax years<br /><br />
1991 and 1992, and franchise tax years 1992 through 1996 in the<br /><br />
approximate amount of $3.0 million. The Company has filed written<br /><br />
protests as to these proposed assessments, and will vigorously<br /><br />
contest the asserted deficiencies through the administrative<br /><br />
appeals process and, if necessary, litigation. The Company<br /><br />
believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial<br /><br />
statements for any liability.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On July 26, 1996, an individual filed three lawsuits against<br /><br />
a wholly owned subsidiary with respect to oil and gas properties<br /><br />
held for sale. One suit alleges actual damage of $580,000 plus<br /><br />
additional amounts that could result from an accounting of a<br /><br />
pooled interest. Another seeks legal and related expenses of<br /><br />
$56,473 from an allegation the plaintiff was not adequately<br /><br />
represented before the Texas Railroad Commission. The third suit<br /><br />
seeks a declaratory judgement that a pooling of a 1938 lease and<br /><br />
another in 1985 should be declared terminated, and further,<br /><br />
plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $1 million to effect<br /><br />
environmental restoration. The Company believes these claims are<br /><br />
without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings which<br /><br />
arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of<br /><br />
Management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to<br /><br />
these actions will not materially affect the financial position<br /><br />
of the Company or results of operations of the Company.<br /><br />

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
XCL-China Ltd.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We have audited the financial statements of XCL-China Ltd. listed<br /><br />
in the Index on page F-1. These financial statements are the<br /><br />
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is<br /><br />
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our<br /><br />
audits.<br /><br />
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted<br /><br />
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and<br /><br />
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether<br /><br />
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.<br /><br />
An<br /><br />
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting<br /><br />
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.<br /><br />
An<br /><br />
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and<br /><br />
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating<br /><br />
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that<br /><br />
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.<br /><br />
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above<br /><br />
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position<br /><br />
of XCL-China Ltd. as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the<br /><br />
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the<br /><br />
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity<br /><br />
with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in<br /><br />
our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above,<br /><br />
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements<br /><br />
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the<br /><br />
information required to be included therein.<br /><br />
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming<br /><br />
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed<br /><br />
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not<br /><br />
generated production revenues, is dependent on its parent to meet<br /><br />
its cash flow requirements and must, in conjunction with its<br /><br />
parent company, generate additional cash flows to satisfy its<br /><br />
development and exploratory obligations with respect to its oil<br /><br />
and gas properties. There is no assurance that the Company or its<br /><br />
parent will be able to generate the necessary funds to satisfy<br /><br />
these<br /><br />
contractual<br /><br />
obligations and to<br /><br />
ultimately<br /><br />
achieve<br /><br />
profitable operations, which creates substantial doubt about<br /><br />
their ability to continue as a going concern. Managements' plans<br /><br />
in regard to these matters are described in Note 2.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might<br /><br />
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Basis of Presentation:<br /><br />
--------------------The financial statements include the accounts of XCL-China<br /><br />
Ltd. (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of XCL Ltd. (the<br /><br />
"parent").<br /><br />
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements:<br /><br />
----------------------------------------------------------The preparation of the Company's financial statements, in<br /><br />
conformity<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
generally accepted accounting<br /><br />
principles,<br /><br />
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect<br /><br />
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses<br /><br />
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.<br /><br />
Actual<br /><br />
results could differ from those estimates.<br /><br />
Oil and Gas Properties:<br /><br />
---------------------The Company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and<br /><br />
production activities using the full cost method of accounting<br /><br />
for oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated<br /><br />
with acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas<br /><br />
reserves, including appropriate related costs, are capitalized.<br /><br />
The Company capitalizes internal costs that can be directly<br /><br />
identified with its acquisition, exploration and development<br /><br />
activities<br /><br />
and does not capitalize any costs related<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.<br /><br />
The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including<br /><br />
the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are<br /><br />
amortized on the unit-of-production method based on estimates of<br /><br />
proved oil and gas reserves. The reserves in 1997 and 1996 were<br /><br />
estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Investments in<br /><br />
unproved properties and major development projects are not<br /><br />
amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can<br /><br />
be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an<br /><br />
assessment indicate that properties are impaired, the amount of<br /><br />
the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be depleted.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company capitalizes interest on expenditures made<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
connection with exploration and development projects that are not<br /><br />
subject to current amortization. Interest is capitalized for the<br /><br />
period that activities are in progress to bring these projects to<br /><br />
their intended use.<br /><br />
The Company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas<br /><br />
properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis, and limits<br /><br />
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties to the present value<br /><br />
of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted<br /><br />
at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved<br /><br />
properties as adjusted for related tax effects and deferred tax<br /><br />
reserves. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is<br /><br />
charged to depreciation and depletion expense.<br /><br />
Proceeds from the sale of proved and unproved properties are<br /><br />
accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs with no gain or<br /><br />
loss recognized unless such sales would significantly alter the<br /><br />
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil<br /><br />
and gas. Abandonments of properties are accounted for<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized.<br /><br />
The Company accounts for site restoration, dismantlement and<br /><br />
abandonment costs in its estimated future costs of proved<br /><br />
reserves.<br /><br />
Accordingly, such costs are amortized on a unit of<br /><br />
production basis and reflected with accumulated depreciation,<br /><br />
depletion and amortization. The Company identifies and estimates<br /><br />
such costs based upon its assessment of applicable regulatory<br /><br />
requirements, its operating experience and oil and gas industry<br /><br />
practice in the areas within which its properties are located.<br /><br />
To date the Company has not been required to expend any material<br /><br />
amounts to satisfy such obligations. The Company does not expect<br /><br />
that future costs will have a material adverse effect on the<br /><br />
Company's operations, financial condition or cash flows.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes<br /><br />
a deduction for any such costs.<br /><br />
Capitalized Interest:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
- -------------------During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, interest and associated<br /><br />
costs of approximately $5.8 million, $2.8 million and $3.1<br /><br />
million, respectively were capitalized on significant investments<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
oil<br /><br />
and gas properties that are not being currently<br /><br />
depreciated, depleted, or amortized and on which exploration or<br /><br />
development activities are in progress.<br /><br />
Revenue Recognition:<br /><br />
------------------Oil and gas revenues will be recognized using the accrual<br /><br />
method at the price realized as production and delivery occurs.<br /><br />
Foreign Operations<br /><br />
-----------------The Company's future operations and earnings will depend<br /><br />
upon the results of the Company's operations in China. There can<br /><br />
be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully<br /><br />
conduct such operations, and a failure to do so would have a<br /><br />
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,<br /><br />
results of operations and cash flows. Also, the success of the<br /><br />
Company's operations will be subject to numerous contingencies,<br /><br />
some<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
are beyond management's<br /><br />
control.<br /><br />
These<br /><br />
contingencies include general and regional economic conditions,<br /><br />
prices for crude oil and natural gas, competition and changes in<br /><br />
regulation.<br /><br />
Since the Company is dependent on international<br /><br />
operations, specifically those in China, the Company will be<br /><br />
subject to various additional political, economic and other<br /><br />
uncertainties. Among other risks, the Company's operations will<br /><br />
be subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds;<br /><br />
export duties, quotas and embargoes; domestic and international<br /><br />
customs and tariffs; and changing taxation policies, foreign<br /><br />
exchange restrictions, political conditions and governmental<br /><br />
regulations.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Liquidity and Management's Plan<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company's parent, in connection with its 1995 decision<br /><br />
to dispose of its domestic properties, is devoting all of its<br /><br />
efforts toward the development of the Company's properties.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company has historically relied on its parent to meet its cash<br /><br />
flow requirements. Although the parent has cash available in the<br /><br />
amount of approximately $32 million as of December 31, 1997<br /><br />
(including restricted cash of approximately $10 million) and a<br /><br />
positive working capital position, management anticipates that<br /><br />
the Company and its parent will need additional funds to meet all<br /><br />
of the development and exploratory obligations until sufficient<br /><br />
cash flows are generated from anticipated production to sustain<br /><br />
operations<br /><br />
and to fund future development and exploration<br /><br />
obligations.<br /><br />
The parent plans to generate the additional cash needed<br /><br />
through the sale or financing of its domestic assets held for<br /><br />
sale and the completion of additional equity, debt or joint<br /><br />
venture transactions. There is no assurance, however, that the<br /><br />
parent will be able to sell or finance its assets held for sale<br /><br />
or to complete other transactions in the future at commercially<br /><br />
reasonable terms, if at all, or that the Company will be able to<br /><br />
meet its future contractual obligations. If production from the<br /><br />
Company's properties commences in late 1998 or the first half of<br /><br />
1999, as anticipated, the Company's proportionate share of the<br /><br />
related cash flow will be available to help satisfy cash<br /><br />
requirements. However, there is likewise no assurance that such<br /><br />
development will be successful and production will commence, and<br /><br />
that such cash flow will be available.<br /><br />
(3)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Supplemental Cash Flow Information<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There were no income taxes paid for the years ended December<br /><br />
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.<br /><br />
(4)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Income Taxes<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Foreign income taxes are accounted for under the tax<br /><br />
structure in that country, principally China. As of December 31,<br /><br />
1997, the Company does not have undistributed earnings available<br /><br />
to its parent because of accumulated losses.<br /><br />
Further, such<br /><br />
<br /><br />
losses<br /><br />
have provided no tax benefit to the parent company and<br /><br />
accordingly, there has been no tax impact. When necessary the<br /><br />
Company will enter into an appropriate tax sharing arrangement<br /><br />
with its parent.<br /><br />
(5)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Other Commitments and Contingencies<br /><br />
Other commitments and contingencies include:<br /><br />
o<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company acquired the rights to the exploration,<br /><br />
development and production of the Zhao Dong Block by executing a<br /><br />
Production Sharing Agreement with CNODC in February 1993. Under<br /><br />
the terms of the Production Sharing Agreement, the Company and<br /><br />
its partner are responsible for all exploration costs. If a<br /><br />
commercial discovery is made, and if CNODC exercises its option<br /><br />
to participate in the development of the field, all development<br /><br />
and operating costs and related oil and gas production will be<br /><br />
shared up to 51 percent by CNODC and the remainder by the<br /><br />
Company and its partner.<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement includes the following<br /><br />
additional principal terms:<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement is basically divided<br /><br />
into<br /><br />
three periods: the Exploration period,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Development period and the Production period. Work to<br /><br />
be performed and expenditures to be incurred during the<br /><br />
Exploration period, which consists of three phases<br /><br />
totaling seven years from May 1, 1993, are<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
exclusive responsibility of the Contractor (the Company<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
its<br /><br />
partner as a group). The<br /><br />
Contractor's<br /><br />
obligations in the three exploration phases are as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the first three years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill three wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $6 million. These obligations have<br /><br />
been met;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the next two years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill two wildcat wells, perform<br /><br />
seismic data acquisition and processing and expend<br /><br />
a minimum of $4 million (The Contractor has<br /><br />
elected to proceed with the second phase of the<br /><br />
Contract.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
seismic<br /><br />
data<br /><br />
acquisition<br /><br />
requirement<br /><br />
for the second phase<br /><br />
has<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
satisfied.);<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
During the last two years, the Contractor is<br /><br />
required to drill two wildcat wells and expend a<br /><br />
minimum of $4 million.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Production Period for any oil and/or gas<br /><br />
field covered by the Contract (the "Contract<br /><br />
Area") will be 15 consecutive years (each of 12<br /><br />
months), commencing for each such field on the<br /><br />
date of commencement of commercial production (as<br /><br />
determined under the terms of the Contract).<br /><br />
However, prior to the Production Period, and<br /><br />
during the Development Period, oil and/or gas may<br /><br />
be produced and sold during a long-term testing<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Production Sharing Agreement may be terminated by<br /><br />
Contractor at the end of each phase of the Exploration<br /><br />
period, without further obligation.<br /><br />
(6)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Related Party Transactions<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company has consistently borrowed money from its parent<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
the acquisition and development of its oil and<br /><br />
gas<br /><br />
properties. The amount due the parent as of December 31, 1997 is<br /><br />
approximately $52 million. All of the Common Stock of the<br /><br />
Company has been pledged as collateral for parent company debt<br /><br />
and the Company is a guarantor on certain Senior Secured Notes<br /><br />
described below.<br /><br />
Senior Secured Notes of Parent Company<br /><br />
--------------------------------------<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
On May 20, 1997, the parent company sold in an unregistered<br /><br />
offering<br /><br />
to qualified institutional buyers and<br /><br />
accredited<br /><br />
institutional investors 75,000 Note Units, each consisting of<br /><br />
$1,000 principal amount of 13.5% Senior Secured Notes due May 1,<br /><br />
2004 and one Common Stock Purchase Warrant to purchase 85 shares<br /><br />
of the parent's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the<br /><br />
"Common Stock"), at an exercise price of $3.09 per share, first<br /><br />
exercisable after May 20, 1998.<br /><br />
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 1 and<br /><br />
November 1, commencing November 1, 1997. The Notes will mature<br /><br />
on May 1, 2004. The Notes are not redeemable at the option of the<br /><br />
parent prior to May 1, 2002, except that the parent may redeem,<br /><br />
at its option prior to May 1, 2002, up to 35% of the original<br /><br />
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, at a redemption price of<br /><br />
113.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus<br /><br />
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption,<br /><br />
with the net proceeds of any equity offering completed within 90<br /><br />
days prior to such redemption; provided that at least $48.75<br /><br />
million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain<br /><br />
outstanding.<br /><br />
On or after May 1, 2002, the Notes are redeemable<br /><br />
at the option of the parent, in whole or in part, at an initial<br /><br />
redemption price of 106.75% of the aggregate principal amount of<br /><br />
the Notes until May 1, 2003, and at par thereafter, plus accrued<br /><br />
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.<br /><br />
The Senior Secured Notes restrict, among other things, the<br /><br />
parent's and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt,<br /><br />
incur liens, pay dividends, or make certain other restricted<br /><br />
payments.<br /><br />
It also limits the parent's ability to consummate<br /><br />
certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
affiliates, enter into mergers or consolidations, or dispose of<br /><br />
substantially all the parent's assets. The parent's ability to<br /><br />
comply with such covenants may be affected by events beyond its<br /><br />
control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a<br /><br />
default.<br /><br />
A default could allow holders of the Notes to declare<br /><br />
all amounts outstanding and accrued interest immediately due and<br /><br />
payable. A foreclosure on the stock of the Company could trigger<br /><br />
Apache's right of first refusal under the Participation Agreement<br /><br />
to purchase such stock or its option to purchase the parent's<br /><br />
interest in the Contract. There can be no assurance that the<br /><br />
assets of the parent and the Company, or any other Subsidiary<br /><br />
Guarantors would be sufficient to fully repay the Notes and the<br /><br />
parent's other indebtedness.<br /><br />

Supplementary Information (Unaudited)<br /><br />
The supplementary information set forth below presents<br /><br />
estimates of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and<br /><br />
gas reserves and changes in such estimates. This information has<br /><br />
been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed by the<br /><br />
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).<br /><br />
Inherent in the<br /><br />
underlying calculations of such data are many variables and<br /><br />
assumptions, the most significant of which are briefly described<br /><br />
below:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5,298<br /><br />
135<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Future cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves were<br /><br />
computed on the basis of (a) contractual prices for oil and gas including escalations for gas - in effect at year-end, or (b) in<br /><br />
the case of properties being commercially developed but not<br /><br />
covered by contracts, the estimated market price for gas and the<br /><br />
posted price for oil in effect at year-end.<br /><br />
Probable and<br /><br />
possible reserves - a portion of which, experience has indicated,<br /><br />
generally become proved once further development work has been<br /><br />
conducted - are not considered. Additionally, estimated future<br /><br />
cash flows are dependent upon the assumed quantities of oil and<br /><br />
gas delivered and purchased from the Company. Such deliverability<br /><br />
estimates are highly complex and are not only based on the<br /><br />
physical<br /><br />
characteristics of a property but<br /><br />
also<br /><br />
include<br /><br />
assumptions relative to purchaser demand. Future prices actually<br /><br />
received may differ from the estimates in the standardized<br /><br />
measure.<br /><br />
Future net cash flows have been reduced by applicable<br /><br />
estimated<br /><br />
operating<br /><br />
costs, production<br /><br />
taxes<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
future<br /><br />
development costs, all of which are based on current costs.<br /><br />
Future net cash flows are further reduced by future income<br /><br />
taxes which are calculated by applying the statutory federal<br /><br />
income tax rate to pretax future net cash flows after utilization<br /><br />
of available tax carryforwards.<br /><br />
To reflect the estimated timing of future net cash flows,<br /><br />
such amounts have been discounted by the Securities and Exchange<br /><br />
Commission prescribed annual rate of 10 percent.<br /><br />
In view of the uncertainties inherent in developing this<br /><br />
supplementary information, it is emphasized that the information<br /><br />
represents approximate amounts which may be imprecise and extreme<br /><br />
caution should accompany its use and interpretation.<br /><br />
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related<br /><br />
to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves<br /><br />
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows<br /><br />
from proved oil and gas reserves, determined in accordance with<br /><br />
rules prescribed by FASB No. 69 is summarized below, and does not<br /><br />
purport to present the fair market value of the Company's oil and<br /><br />
gas assets, but does present the present value of estimated<br /><br />
future cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.:<br /><br />
The Company previously excluded from this table, the effect of<br /><br />
income taxes because it believed it had a tax holiday in China.<br /><br />
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company determined that it<br /><br />
would be subject to future income taxes at the maximum rate of<br /><br />
33% in China. Accordingly, the table below has been revised to<br /><br />
include estimates of such income taxes.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Indemnification of Directors and Officers<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company's Amended and Restated<br /><br />
Incorporation (the "Certificate") provides that:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Certificate<br /><br />
<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(A)<br /><br />
No director of the Company will be personally<br /><br />
liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages<br /><br />
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability<br /><br />
(i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the<br /><br />
Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in<br /><br />
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing<br /><br />
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General<br /><br />
Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the<br /><br />
director derived an improper personal benefit.<br /><br />
(B)<br /><br />
Each person who was or is made a party or is<br /><br />
threatened to be made a party to or involved in any action suit<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
proceeding<br /><br />
whether civil, criminal, administrative<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact<br /><br />
that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of the<br /><br />
Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a<br /><br />
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
partnership, joint venture, trust or other<br /><br />
enterprise,<br /><br />
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan,<br /><br />
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an<br /><br />
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in<br /><br />
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee<br /><br />
or agent, will be indemnified and held harmless by the Company to<br /><br />
the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation<br /><br />
Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but in the<br /><br />
case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such<br /><br />
amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification<br /><br />
rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
amendment), against all expense, liability and<br /><br />
loss<br /><br />
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, including excise<br /><br />
taxes with respect to an employee benefit plan, or penalties and<br /><br />
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by<br /><br />
such person in connection therewith and such indemnification will<br /><br />
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,<br /><br />
employee or agent and will inure to the benefit of his or her<br /><br />
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,<br /><br />
except as described in (C) below, the Company will indemnify any<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
person seeking indemnification in connection with<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
proceeding (or part hereof) initiated by such person only if such<br /><br />
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of<br /><br />
directors of the Company. The right to indemnification described<br /><br />
in this paragraph B includes the right to be paid by the Company<br /><br />
the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance<br /><br />
of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the Delaware<br /><br />
General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses<br /><br />
incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a<br /><br />
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which<br /><br />
service was or is rendered by such person while a director or<br /><br />
officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee<br /><br />
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
proceeding, will be made only upon delivery to the Company of an<br /><br />
undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to<br /><br />
repay all amounts so advanced if it will ultimately be determined<br /><br />
that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified<br /><br />
under the Certificate or otherwise.<br /><br />
(C)<br /><br />
If a claim described in paragraph (B) above is<br /><br />
not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) after written<br /><br />
claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any<br /><br />
time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the<br /><br />
unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in<br /><br />
part, the claimant will be entitled to be paid also the expense<br /><br />
of prosecuting such claim. It will be a defense to any such<br /><br />
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for<br /><br />
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its<br /><br />
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is<br /><br />
required, has been tendered to the Company) that the claimant has<br /><br />
not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under<br /><br />
the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Company to indemnify<br /><br />
the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving<br /><br />
such defense will be on the Company. Neither the failure of the<br /><br />
Company (including its board of directors, independent legal<br /><br />
<br /><br />
counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior<br /><br />
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the<br /><br />
claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met<br /><br />
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware<br /><br />
General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the<br /><br />
Company (including its board of directors, independent legal<br /><br />
counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such<br /><br />
applicable standard of conduct, will be a defense to the action<br /><br />
or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the<br /><br />
applicable standard of conduct.<br /><br />
(D)<br /><br />
The right to indemnification and the payment of<br /><br />
expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its<br /><br />
final disposition conferred in the Certificate will not be<br /><br />
exclusive of any right which any person may have or hereafter<br /><br />
acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate, the<br /><br />
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"),<br /><br />
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or<br /><br />
otherwise.<br /><br />
(E)<br /><br />
The Company may maintain insurance, at its<br /><br />
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or<br /><br />
agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint<br /><br />
venture, trust or other enterprise, including an employee benefit<br /><br />
plan, against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not<br /><br />
the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against<br /><br />
such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General<br /><br />
Corporation Law.<br /><br />
(F)<br /><br />
Upon resolution passed by the board of<br /><br />
directors, the Company may establish a trust or other designated<br /><br />
account, grant a security interest or use other means (including,<br /><br />
without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of<br /><br />
certain of its obligations arising under the indemnification<br /><br />
provisions contained in the Certificate.<br /><br />
(G)<br /><br />
If any part of the indemnification provisions<br /><br />
contained in the Certificate will be found, in any action, suit<br /><br />
or proceeding or appeal therefrom or in any other circumstances<br /><br />
or as to any particular officer, director or employee to be<br /><br />
unenforceable, ineffective or invalid for any reason,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
enforceability, effect and validity of the remaining parts or of<br /><br />
such parts in other circumstances will not be affected, except as<br /><br />
otherwise required by applicable law.<br /><br />
The Bylaws provide that:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
the Company will indemnify to the full<br /><br />
extent permitted by, and in the manner permissible<br /><br />
under, the laws of the State of Delaware any person<br /><br />
made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or<br /><br />
proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or<br /><br />
investigative, by reason of the fact that he, his<br /><br />
testator or intestate is or was a director or officer<br /><br />
of the Company or any predecessor of the Company, or<br /><br />
served any other enterprise as a director or officer at<br /><br />
the request of the Company or any predecessor of the<br /><br />
Company.<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
the rights of indemnification described<br /><br />
in paragraph (i) above will be deemed to be a contract<br /><br />
between the Company and each director and officer who<br /><br />
serves in such capacity at any time while<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
provision is in effect, and any repeal or modification<br /><br />
thereof will not affect any rights or obligations then<br /><br />
existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore<br /><br />
brought based in whole or in part upon any such state<br /><br />
of facts;<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
the rights of indemnification described<br /><br />
in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above will not be deemed<br /><br />
exclusive of any other rights to which any director or<br /><br />
officer may be entitled apart from the provisions of<br /><br />
Article VIII of the Bylaws (governing indemnification);<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
the board of directors in its discretion<br /><br />
will have power on behalf of the Company to indemnify<br /><br />
any person, other than a director or officer, made a<br /><br />
party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was<br /><br />
an employee of the Company.<br /><br />
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising<br /><br />
under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers<br /><br />
or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing<br /><br />
provisions, the Company has been informed that in the opinion of<br /><br />
the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is<br /><br />
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is<br /><br />
therefore unenforceable.<br /><br />

meeting of shareholders if, at the date of notice convening a meeting<br /><br />
of shareholders, the dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock was<br /><br />
six months or more in arrears.<br /><br />
The Series A Preferred Stock was<br /><br />
convertible, at the holder's option, on the basis of 21 shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock for every one share of Series A Preferred Stock,<br /><br />
subject<br /><br />
to adjustment and bore a cumulative dividend fixed at an<br /><br />
annual rate of 4.50 U.K. Pounds Sterling per share, payable semiannually in cash, or, at the Company's election, in additional<br /><br />
shares of Series A Preferred Stock.<br /><br />
During the second quarter of 1996, the Company issued<br /><br />

for such dividend period. Effective November 10, 1997, the<br /><br />
Company recapitalized and combined the Series A Preferred Stock<br /><br />
into an aggregate of 726,907 shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock (including approximately $900,000 in unpaid dividends<br /><br />
declared for June 30, 1995 and accrued and unpaid dividends from<br /><br />
June 30, 1996 through November 9, 1997).<br /><br />
Series B Preferred Stock/Amended Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
-----------------------------------------------------------The Series B, Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,<br /><br />
par value $1.00 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock") bears<br /><br />
a cumulative fixed dividend at an annual rate of $10 per share,<br /><br />
payable semiannually, and is entitled to 50 votes per share on<br /><br />
all matters on which Common Stockholders are entitled to vote and<br /><br />
separately as a class on certain matters; ranks senior to the<br /><br />
Common Stock and pari passu with the Series A and Series E<br /><br />
Preferred Stocks of the Company with respect to the payment of<br /><br />
dividends and distributions on liquidation; and has a liquidation<br /><br />
preference of $100 per share plus accumulated dividends.<br /><br />
The Company had the option through May 1994, to pay the<br /><br />
dividend in shares of Common Stock, in which case the annual<br /><br />
dividend rate was $12 per share, with the holder being entitled<br /><br />
to require the Company to use its best efforts to sell such<br /><br />
shares on their behalf and to reimburse such holder for the<br /><br />
difference, if any, between such net proceeds and $11 per share<br /><br />
per annum.<br /><br />
The Company is currently entitled to pay the<br /><br />
redemption price of the Series B Preferred Stock in shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock.<br /><br />
Effective June 30, 1994, the terms of the Series B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock were amended to permit the Company to issue<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock in lieu of cash dividends for so long as<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Series<br /><br />
B<br /><br />
Preferred Stock remains<br /><br />
outstanding.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
consideration for this amendment, the Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
was further amended: (i) to reduce the exercise price of the<br /><br />
remaining 2.5 million warrants outstanding from $2.00 to $1.50<br /><br />
per share and to increase the number of shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
covered by such warrants to 3.325 million shares and (ii) to<br /><br />
extend the option of the holders to redeem their shares of Series<br /><br />
B Preferred Stock, which were only redeemable on the third,<br /><br />
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the dates of their issuance and<br /><br />
automatically upon exercise of the remaining warrants, upon<br /><br />
ninety days notice to the Company, at any time and from time to<br /><br />
time, after August 31, 1994, with the Company retaining the right<br /><br />
to pay the redemption price in Common Stock.<br /><br />
In May 1995, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
exercised its redemption rights. In July 1997, the holder<br /><br />
commenced a lawsuit against the Company and its then-directors<br /><br />
regarding the redemption of the shares. Effective December 31,<br /><br />
1997, the Company and the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock<br /><br />
entered into an interim settlement with respect to the action,<br /><br />
conditioned upon the closing of the final settlement on or before<br /><br />
February 27, 1998 which was later extended to March 6, 1998. The<br /><br />
closing of the final settlement took place on March 3, 1998, and<br /><br />
on that date the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock sold the<br /><br />
stock and accompanying warrants to Arbco Associates, L.P., Kayne<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Item 17.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Undertakings<br /><br />
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales<br /><br />
are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration<br /><br />
statement:<br /><br />
(i) To include any prospectus required<br /><br />
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Section<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events<br /><br />
arising after the effective date of the registration statement<br /><br />
(or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,<br /><br />
individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change<br /><br />
in the information set forth in the registration statement.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume<br /><br />
of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities<br /><br />
offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any<br /><br />
deviation from the low or high and of the estimated maximum<br /><br />
offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed<br /><br />
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate,<br /><br />
the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent<br /><br />
change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the<br /><br />
"Calculation<br /><br />
of Registration Fee" table in the<br /><br />
effective<br /><br />
registration statement;<br /><br />
(iii) To include any material information with respect<br /><br />
to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the<br /><br />
registration statement or any material change to such information<br /><br />
in the registration statement.<br /><br />
(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability<br /><br />
under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective<br /><br />
amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement<br /><br />
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of<br /><br />
such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial<br /><br />
bona fide offering thereof.<br /><br />
(3) To remove from registration by means of a<br /><br />
effective amendment any of the securities being registered<br /><br />
remain unsold at the termination of the offering.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
postwhich<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the<br /><br />
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and<br /><br />
controlling persons of the undersigned registrant pursuant to the<br /><br />
provisions described under Item 14 above, or otherwise, the<br /><br />
undersigned registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of<br /><br />
the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is<br /><br />
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is,<br /><br />
therefore, unenforceable.<br /><br />
In the event that a claim<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment<br /><br />
by the undersigned registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a<br /><br />
director, officer or controlling person of the undersigned<br /><br />
registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or<br /><br />
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling<br /><br />
person in connection with the securities being registered, the<br /><br />
undersigned registrant will, unless, in the opinion of its<br /><br />
counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,<br /><br />
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question<br /><br />
whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as<br /><br />
expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final<br /><br />
adjudication of such issue.<br /><br />
SIGNATURES<br /><br />
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of<br /><br />
1933, the Registrant has duly caused this Amendment No. 2 to the<br /><br />
Registration Statement on Form S-1 to be signed on its behalf by<br /><br />
the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of<br /><br />
Lafayette, State of Louisiana on the 23rd day of October, 1998.<br /><br />

THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received, PATRICK B. COLLINS<br /><br />
or registered assigns (the "Holder") is the registered holder of<br /><br />
warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase from XCL Ltd., a Delaware<br /><br />

beginning on June 30, 1998 and until 5:00 p.m., New York time, on<br /><br />
June 30, 2003 (the "Expiration Date"), subject to the conditions<br /><br />
set forth herein, at the initial exercise price of $3.75 per<br /><br />
share (the "Initial Exercise Price"), subject to adjustment as<br /><br />
set forth herein (the "Exercise Price"), up to an aggregate of<br /><br />
seventeen thousand (17,000) fully paid and non-assessable common<br /><br />
shares, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the<br /><br />
Company (the "Shares") upon surrender of this warrant certificate<br /><br />
(the "Certificate") and payment of the Exercise Price multiplied<br /><br />
by the number of Shares in respect of which Warrants are then<br /><br />
being exercised (the "Purchase Price") at the principal office of<br /><br />
the Company presently located at 110 Rue Jean Lafitte, Lafayette,<br /><br />
LA 70508, United States of America.<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exercise of Warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The exercise of any Warrants represented<br /><br />
this Certificate is subject to the conditions set forth below<br /><br />
paragraph 4, "Compliance with U.S. Securities Laws."<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Subject to compliance with all of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conditions set forth herein, the Holder shall have the right at<br /><br />
any time and from time to time after June 30, 1998 to purchase<br /><br />
from the Company the number of Shares which the Holder may at the<br /><br />
time be entitled to purchase pursuant hereto, upon surrender of<br /><br />
this Certificate to the Company at its principal office, together<br /><br />
with the form of election to purchase attached hereto duly com<br /><br />
pleted and signed, and upon payment to the Company of the<br /><br />
Purchase Price.<br /><br />
No Warrant may be exercised after 5:00 p.m., New York time,<br /><br />
on the Expiration Date, after which time all Warrants evidenced<br /><br />
hereby shall be void.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made in<br /><br />
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by<br /><br />
certified check or banker's draft payable to the order of the Com<br /><br />
pany, or any combination of the foregoing.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
The Warrants represented by this Certificate<br /><br />
are exercisable at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part<br /><br />
(but not as to fractional Shares). Upon the exercise of less<br /><br />
than all of the Warrants evidenced by this Certificate, the<br /><br />
Company shall forthwith issue to the Holder a new certificate of<br /><br />
like tenor representing the number of unexercised Warrants.<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
Subject to compliance with all of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conditions set forth herein, upon surrender of this Certificate<br /><br />
to the Company at its principal office, together with the form of<br /><br />
election to purchase attached hereto duly completed and signed,<br /><br />
and upon payment of the Purchase Price, the Company shall cause<br /><br />
to be delivered promptly to or upon the written order of the<br /><br />
Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate, a<br /><br />
share certificate or share certificates for the number of whole<br /><br />
Shares purchased upon the exercise of the Warrants. Such share<br /><br />
certificate or share certificates representing the Shares shall<br /><br />
be free of any restrictive legend. The Company shall ensure that<br /><br />
no "stop transfer" or similar instruction or order with respect<br /><br />
to the Shares purchased upon exercise of the Warrants shall be in<br /><br />
effect at ChaseMellon Shareholders Services, IRG Plc or any suc<br /><br />
cessor transfer agent for the Common Stock of the Company (the<br /><br />
"Transfer Agent").<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Elimination of Fractional Interests.<br /><br />
The Company<br /><br />
shall<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
be required to issue certificates representing<br /><br />
fractions of Shares and shall not be required to issue scrip in<br /><br />
lieu of fractional interests. Instead of any fractional Shares<br /><br />
that would otherwise be issuable to the Holder, the Company shall<br /><br />
pay to the Holder a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional<br /><br />
interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest of the<br /><br />
then-current Market Price per share (as defined in Section 7(f)<br /><br />
hereof).<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all documen<br /><br />
tary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the issuance and<br /><br />
delivery of the Shares upon the exercise of the Warrants;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay<br /><br />
any taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer<br /><br />
involved in the issuance or delivery of any Warrant or any Shares<br /><br />
in any name other than that of the Holder, which transfer taxes<br /><br />
shall be paid by the Holder, and until payment of such transfer<br /><br />
taxes, if any, the Company shall not be required to issue such<br /><br />
Shares.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
Compliance with U.S. Securities Laws. The Warrants<br /><br />
have not been, and will not be, registered under the United<br /><br />
States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),<br /><br />
or any other federal or state securities or blue sky laws. No<br /><br />
offer, sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition (collectively,<br /><br />
a "Disposal") of the Warrants represented by this Certificate may<br /><br />
be made unless (i) registered under the Act and any applicable<br /><br />
State securities or blue sky laws or (ii) the Company receives a<br /><br />
written opinion of United States legal counsel in form and<br /><br />
substance satisfactory to it to the effect that such Disposal is<br /><br />
exempt from such registration requirements..<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Transfer of Warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The Warrants shall be transferable only on the<br /><br />
books of the Company maintained at the Company's principal office<br /><br />
upon delivery of this Certificate with the form of assignment<br /><br />
attached hereto duly completed and signed by the Holder or by its<br /><br />
duly authorized attorney or representative, accompanied by proper<br /><br />
evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer. The<br /><br />
Company may, in its discretion, require, as a condition to any<br /><br />
transfer of Warrants, a signature guarantee, which may be<br /><br />
provided by a commercial bank or trust company, by a broker or<br /><br />
dealer which is a member of the National Association<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Securities Dealers, Inc., or by a member of a United States<br /><br />
national<br /><br />
securities exchange, The Securities<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
Futures<br /><br />
Authority Limited in the United Kingdom, or The London Stock<br /><br />
Exchange Limited in London, England. Upon any registration of<br /><br />
transfer, the Company shall deliver a new warrant certificate or<br /><br />
warrant certificates of like tenor and evidencing in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
aggregate a like number of Warrants to the person entitled<br /><br />
thereto in exchange for this Certificate, subject to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
limitations provided herein, without any charge except for any<br /><br />
tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Notwithstanding anything in this Certifi-cate<br /><br />
to the contrary, neither any of the Warrants nor any of the<br /><br />
Shares issuable upon exercise of any of the Warrants shall be<br /><br />
transferable, except upon compliance by the Holder with any<br /><br />
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and any applicable<br /><br />
state securities or blue sky laws.<br /><br />
6.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exchange and Replacement of Warrant<br /><br />
Certificates; Loss or Mutilation of<br /><br />
Warrant Certificates.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
This Certificate is exchangeable without cost,<br /><br />
upon the surrender hereof by the Holder at the principal office<br /><br />
of the Company, for new warrant certificates of like tenor and<br /><br />
date representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the same<br /><br />
number of Shares in such denominations as shall be designated by<br /><br />
the Holder at the time of such surrender. Any transfer not made<br /><br />
in such compliance shall be null and void and shall be given no<br /><br />
effect hereunder.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence<br /><br />
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or<br /><br />
mutilation of this Certificate and, in case of such loss, theft<br /><br />
or destruction, of indemnity and security reasonably satisfactory<br /><br />
to it, and reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable<br /><br />
expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation<br /><br />
of this Certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and<br /><br />
deliver a new warrant certificate of like tenor, in lieu thereof.<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
Initial Exercise Price; Adjustment of Exercise<br /><br />
Price and Number of Shares.<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The Warrants initially are exercisable at the<br /><br />
Initial Exercise Price per Share, subject to adjustment from time<br /><br />
to time as provided herein. No adjustments will be made for cash<br /><br />
<br /><br />
dividends, if any, paid to shareholders of record prior<br /><br />
date on which the Warrants are exercised.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
In case the Company shall at any time after the<br /><br />
date of this Certificate (i) declare a dividend on the shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) subdivide<br /><br />
or split up the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the amount of<br /><br />
Shares to be delivered upon exercise of any Warrant will be<br /><br />
appropriately increased so that the Holder will be entitled to<br /><br />
receive the amount of Shares that such Holder would have owned<br /><br />
immediately<br /><br />
following such actions had such Warrant<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
exercised immediately prior thereto, and the Exercise Price in<br /><br />
effect immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or<br /><br />
the effective date for such subdivision shall be proportionately<br /><br />
decreased, all effective immediately after the record date for<br /><br />
such dividend or the effective date for such subdivision or split<br /><br />
up.<br /><br />
Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever any<br /><br />
event listed above shall occur.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
In case the Company shall at any time after the<br /><br />
date of this Certificate combine the outstanding shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock into a smaller number of shares the amount of Shares to be<br /><br />
delivered upon exercise of any Warrant will be appropriately<br /><br />
decreased so that the Holder will be entitled to receive the<br /><br />
amount of Shares that such Holder would have owned immediately<br /><br />
following such action had such Warrant been exercised immediately<br /><br />
prior thereto, and the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior<br /><br />
to the record date for such combination shall be proportionately<br /><br />
increased, effective immediately after the record date for such<br /><br />
combination. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever<br /><br />
any such combinations shall occur.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
In the event that the Company shall at any time<br /><br />
after the date of this Certificate (i) issue or sell any shares<br /><br />
of Common Stock (other than the Shares) or securities convertible<br /><br />
or exchangeable into Common Stock without consideration or at a<br /><br />
price per share (or having a conversion price per share, if a<br /><br />
security convertible into Common Stock) less than the Market<br /><br />
Value per share of Common Stock (as defined in Section 7(f)<br /><br />
hereof), or (ii) issue or sell options, rights or warrants to<br /><br />
subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at a price per share less<br /><br />
than the Market Price per share of Common Stock (as defined in<br /><br />
Section 7(f) hereof), the Exercise Price to be in effect after<br /><br />
the date of such issuance shall be determined by multiplying the<br /><br />
Exercise Price in effect on the day immediately preceding the<br /><br />
relevant issuance or record date, as the case may be, used in<br /><br />
determining such Market Value or Market Price, by a fraction, the<br /><br />
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
outstanding on such issuance or record date plus the number of<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the<br /><br />
total number of shares of Common Stock so to be issued or to be<br /><br />
offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate initial<br /><br />
conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered)<br /><br />
would purchase at such Market Value or Market Price, as the case<br /><br />
may be, and the denominator of which shall be the number of<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock outstanding on such issuance or record<br /><br />
date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock to be<br /><br />
issued or to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into<br /><br />
which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially<br /><br />
convertible); such adjustment shall become effective immediately<br /><br />
after the close of business on such issuance or record date;<br /><br />
provided, however, that no such adjustment shall be made for the<br /><br />
issuance of (s) options to purchase shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
granted pursuant to the Company's employee stock option plans<br /><br />
approved by shareholders of the Company (and the shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock issuable upon exercise of such options) (provided that<br /><br />
option exercise prices shall not be less than the Market Value of<br /><br />
the Common Stock (as defined in Section 7(f) hereof) on the date<br /><br />
of the grant of such options), (t) the Company's warrants to<br /><br />
purchase shares of Common Stock (and the shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
issuable upon exercise of such warrants), outstanding on the date<br /><br />
hereof, (u) the Company's shares of Amended Series A, Cumulative<br /><br />
Convertible Preferred Stock (and the shares of such Preferred<br /><br />
Stock issued in lieu of dividend payments thereunder and the<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or redemption of<br /><br />
such Preferred Stock), outstanding on the date hereof, or (v) the<br /><br />
Company's shares of Amended Series B, Cumulative Convertible<br /><br />
Preferred Stock (and the shares of Common Stock issued in lieu of<br /><br />
dividend payments thereunder and the shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
issuable upon conversion or redemption of such Preferred Stock),<br /><br />
<br /><br />
outstanding on the date hereof. In case such subscription price<br /><br />
may be paid in a consideration, part or all of which shall be in<br /><br />
a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be<br /><br />
as determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of<br /><br />
Directors of the Company. Shares of Common Stock owned by or<br /><br />
held<br /><br />
for the account of the Company or any wholly-owned<br /><br />
subsidiary shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any<br /><br />
such computation.<br /><br />
Such adjustment shall be made successively<br /><br />
whenever the date of such issuance is fixed (which date of<br /><br />
issuance shall be the record date for such issuance if a record<br /><br />
date therefor is fixed); and, in the event that such shares or<br /><br />
options, rights or warrants are not so issued, the Exercise Price<br /><br />
shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then<br /><br />
be in effect if the date of such issuance had not been fixed.<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
In case the Company shall make a distribution<br /><br />
to all holders of Common Stock (including any such distribution<br /><br />
made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the<br /><br />
Company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of its<br /><br />
indebtedness, securities other than Common Stock or assets (other<br /><br />
than cash dividends or cash distributions payable out<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
consolidated earnings or earned surplus or dividends payable in<br /><br />
Common Stock), the Exercise Price to be in effect after such date<br /><br />
of distribution shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise<br /><br />
Price in effect on the date immediately preceding the record date<br /><br />
for the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive<br /><br />
such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be<br /><br />
the Market Price per share of Common Stock (as defined in Section<br /><br />
7(f) hereof) on such date, less the then-fair market value (as<br /><br />
determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors<br /><br />
of the Company of the portion of the assets, securities or<br /><br />
evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed applicable to one<br /><br />
share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such<br /><br />
Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to be<br /><br />
effective immediately after the distribution resulting in such<br /><br />
adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever<br /><br />
a date for such distribution is fixed (which date of distribution<br /><br />
shall be the record date for such distribution if a record date<br /><br />
therefor is fixed); and, if such distribution is not so made, the<br /><br />
Exercise Price shall again be adjusted to be the Exercise Price<br /><br />
which would then be in effect if such date of distribution had<br /><br />
not been fixed.<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
For the purposes of any computation under this<br /><br />
Section 7, the "Market Price per share" of Common Stock on any<br /><br />
date shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid price<br /><br />
for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the record date for<br /><br />
the determination of the shareholders entitled to receive any<br /><br />
rights, dividends or distributions described in this Section 7,<br /><br />
and the "Market Value per share" of Common Stock on any date<br /><br />
shall be deemed to be the closing bid price on the date of the<br /><br />
issuance of the securities for which such computation is being<br /><br />
made, as reported on the principal United States securities<br /><br />
exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to<br /><br />
trading or if the Common Stock is not then listed on any United<br /><br />
States stock exchange, the average of the closing sales price on<br /><br />
each such day during such 20 day period, in the case of the<br /><br />
Market Price computation, or on such date of issuance, in the<br /><br />
case of the Market Value computation, in the over-the-counter<br /><br />
market as reported by the National Association of Securities<br /><br />
Dealers' Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), or, if not so<br /><br />
reported, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on each<br /><br />
such day during such 20 day period in the case of the Market<br /><br />
Price computation, or on such date of issuance, in the case of<br /><br />
the Market Value computation, as reported in the "pink sheets"<br /><br />
published by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. or any successor<br /><br />
thereof, or, if not so quoted, the average of the middle market<br /><br />
quotations for such 20 day period in the case of the Market Price<br /><br />
computation, or on such date of issuance, in the case of the<br /><br />
Market Value computation, as reported on the daily official list<br /><br />
of the prices of stock listed on The London Stock Exchange<br /><br />
Limited ("The Stock Exchange Daily Official List").<br /><br />
"Trading<br /><br />
day" means any day on which the Common Stock is available for<br /><br />
trading on the applicable securities exchange or<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
applicable securities market. In the case of Market Price or<br /><br />
Market Value computations based on The Stock Exchange Daily<br /><br />
Official List, the Market Price or Market Value shall be<br /><br />
converted into United States dollars at the then spot market<br /><br />
exchange rate of pounds sterling (UK) into United States dollars<br /><br />
as quoted by Chemical Bank or any successor bank thereto on the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
date of determination. If a quotation of such exchange rate is<br /><br />
not so available, the exchange rate shall be the exchange rate of<br /><br />
pounds sterling in United States dollars as quoted in The Wall<br /><br />
Street Journal on the date of determination.<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
No adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be<br /><br />
required unless such adjustment would require an increase or<br /><br />
decrease of at least $.02 in such price; provided that any<br /><br />
adjustments which by reason of this Section 7(g) are not required<br /><br />
to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any<br /><br />
subsequent adjustment; provided, further that such adjustment<br /><br />
shall be made in all events (regardless of whether or not the<br /><br />
amount thereof or the cumulative amount thereof amounts to $.02<br /><br />
(or more) upon the happening of one or more of the events<br /><br />
specified in Sections 7(b), (c) or (i). All calculations under<br /><br />
this Section 7 shall be made to the nearest cent.<br /><br />
(h)<br /><br />
If at any time, as a result of an adjustment<br /><br />
made pursuant to Section 7(b) or (c) hereof, the Holder of any<br /><br />
Warrant thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any<br /><br />
shares of the Company other than shares of Common Stock,<br /><br />
thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon<br /><br />
exercise of any Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time<br /><br />
to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as<br /><br />
practicable to the provisions with respect to the<br /><br />
Shares<br /><br />
contained in this Section 7, and the provisions of<br /><br />
this<br /><br />
Certificate with respect to the Shares shall apply on like terms<br /><br />
to such other shares.<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
In the case of (l) any capital reorganization<br /><br />
of the Company, or of (2) any reclassification of the shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
outstanding shares of Common Stock), or (3) any consolidation or<br /><br />
merger of the Company, or (4) the sale, lease or other transfer<br /><br />
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the<br /><br />
Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other person<br /><br />
or entity, each Warrant shall after such capital reorganization,<br /><br />
reclassification of the shares of Common Stock, consolidation, or<br /><br />
sale be exercisable, upon the terms and conditions specified in<br /><br />
this Certificate, for the number of shares of stock or other<br /><br />
securities or assets to which a holder of the number of Shares<br /><br />
purchasable (immediately prior to the effectiveness of such<br /><br />
capital reorganization, reclassification of shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock, consolidation, or sale) upon exercise of a Warrant would<br /><br />
have<br /><br />
been<br /><br />
entitled<br /><br />
upon<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
capital<br /><br />
reorganization,<br /><br />
reclassification of shares of Common Stock, consolidation, merger<br /><br />
or sale; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set<br /><br />
forth in this Section 7 with respect to the rights thereafter of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Holder shall be appropriately adjusted (as determined<br /><br />
reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors of the<br /><br />
Company) so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be,<br /><br />
to any shares of stock or other securities or assets thereafter<br /><br />
deliverable on the exercise of a Warrant. The Company shall not<br /><br />
effect any such consolidation or sale, unless prior to or<br /><br />
simultaneously with the consummation thereof, the successor<br /><br />
corporation, partnership or other entity (if other than the<br /><br />
Company) resulting from such consolidation or the corporation,<br /><br />
partnership or other entity purchasing such assets or the<br /><br />
appropriate entity shall assume, by written instrument, the<br /><br />
obligation to deliver to the Holder of each Warrant the shares of<br /><br />
stock, securities or assets to which, in accordance with the<br /><br />
foregoing provisions, such Holder may be entitled and all other<br /><br />
obligations of the Company under this Certificate. For purposes<br /><br />
of this Section 7(i) a merger to which the Company is a party but<br /><br />
in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior thereto<br /><br />
is changed into securities of another corporation shall be deemed<br /><br />
a consolidation with such other corporation being the successor<br /><br />
and resulting corporation.<br /><br />
(j)<br /><br />
Irrespective of any adjustments in the Exercise<br /><br />
Price or the number or kind of shares purchasable upon the<br /><br />
exercise of the Warrant, Warrant Certificates theretofore or<br /><br />
thereafter issued may continue to express the same Exercise Price<br /><br />
per share and number and kind of Shares as are stated on the<br /><br />
Warrant Certificates initially issuable pursuant to this Warrant.<br /><br />
(k)<br /><br />
The Company may, in its sole discretion, at any<br /><br />
time and from time to time before the Expiration Date, reduce the<br /><br />
Exercise Price to any lower amount by notice to the Holders, in<br /><br />
the manner provided in Section 12.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
Notices to Warrant Holders. Nothing contained in<br /><br />
this Certificate shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder<br /><br />
the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a stock<br /><br />
holder in respect of any meetings of stockholders for the<br /><br />
election of directors or any other matter, or as having any<br /><br />
rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company. If, however,<br /><br />
at any time prior to the exercise or expiration of the Warrants,<br /><br />
any of the following events shall occur:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the holders of shares of the Common Stock shall<br /><br />
be entitled to receive a dividend or distribution<br /><br />
payable otherwise than in cash, or a cash dividend<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
distribution payable otherwise than out of<br /><br />
current or retained earnings, as indicated by the<br /><br />
accounting treatment of such dividend<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
dis<br /><br />
tribution on the books of the Company; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii) the Company shall offer to all the holders of its<br /><br />
Common Stock any additional shares of capital stock<br /><br />
of the Company or securities convertible into or<br /><br />
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the<br /><br />
Company, or any option, right or warrant to sub<br /><br />
scribe therefor; or<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the<br /><br />
Company (other than in connection with a consoli<br /><br />
dation or merger) or a sale of all or substantially<br /><br />
all of its property, assets and business as an<br /><br />
entirety shall be approved by the Company's Board<br /><br />
of Directors; or<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
there shall be any capital reorganization or<br /><br />
reclassification of the capital stock<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company (other than a change in the number of<br /><br />
outstanding shares of Common Stock or a change in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
par<br /><br />
value<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Common<br /><br />
Stock),<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
consolidation or merger of the Company with another<br /><br />
entity;<br /><br />
then, in any one or more of said events, the Company shall give<br /><br />
written notice of such event at least fifteen (15) days prior to<br /><br />
the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the<br /><br />
transfer books for the determination of the stockholders entitled<br /><br />
to such dividend, distribution, convertible or exchangeable secur<br /><br />
ities or subscription rights, options or warrants, or entitled to<br /><br />
vote on such proposed dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or<br /><br />
sale. Such notice shall specify such record date or the date of<br /><br />
closing the transfer books, as the case may be. Failure to give<br /><br />
such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity<br /><br />
of any action taken in connection with the declaration or payment<br /><br />
of any such dividend or distribution, or the issuance of any<br /><br />
convertible or exchangeable securities or subscription rights,<br /><br />
options or warrants, or any proposed dissolution, liquidation,<br /><br />
winding-up or sale.<br /><br />

110 Rue Jean Lafitte, 2nd Floor<br /><br />

Ladies and Gentlemen:<br /><br />
In connection with the proposed exchange (the "Exchange") of<br /><br />
warrants, each dated May 20, 1998 (the "Old Warrants"), to<br /><br />
purchase an aggregate of 351,015 shares of the common stock, par<br /><br />
value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of XCL Ltd.<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
"Company") for one new warrant to purchase an aggregate of<br /><br />
351,015 shares of Common Stock (the "Warrant Shares") at an<br /><br />
exercise price of $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment (the<br /><br />
"Exercise Price"), which expires on September 30, 1998, in<br /><br />
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "New<br /><br />
Warrant",<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
together<br /><br />
with<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Warrant<br /><br />
Shares,<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
"Securities"), we confirm that:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We have received a copy of the Company's Annual<br /><br />
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December<br /><br />
31, 1997; the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q<br /><br />
for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1998 and the<br /><br />
Preliminary Prospectus dated May 8, 1998 as filed with<br /><br />
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as<br /><br />
part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File<br /><br />
No. 333-51937) (the "Preliminary Prospectus") (which<br /><br />
Preliminary Prospectus is subject to SEC comment and<br /><br />
amendment) and such other information as we deem<br /><br />
necessary in order to make our investment decision to<br /><br />
participate<br /><br />
in the Exchange and to acquire<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities.<br /><br />
We acknowledge that we have read and<br /><br />
agreed to the matters stated in the sections entitled<br /><br />
"Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Information",<br /><br />
"Risk Factors" and "Selling Security Holders" of such<br /><br />
Preliminary<br /><br />
Prospectus which are incorporated<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
reference herein and that we are aware of the high<br /><br />
degree of risk attendant to an investment in the<br /><br />
Securities.<br /><br />
We have had the opportunity to<br /><br />
ask<br /><br />
questions and receive answers from the management of<br /><br />
the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the<br /><br />
Exchange and the Securities and the Company, its<br /><br />
business, financial condition and prospects and to<br /><br />
obtain any additional information which the Company<br /><br />
possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or<br /><br />
expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
information that has been furnished to us.<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We understand that any subsequent transfer of the<br /><br />
Securities is subject to certain restrictions and<br /><br />
conditions set forth in the New Warrant and the<br /><br />
undersigned agrees to be bound by, and not to resell,<br /><br />
pledge or otherwise transfer the Securities except in<br /><br />
compliance with, such restrictions and conditions and<br /><br />
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities<br /><br />
Act") and all applicable State securities laws and the<br /><br />
rules<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
regulations<br /><br />
promulgated<br /><br />
thereunder,<br /><br />
including, without limitation, Regulation M promulgated<br /><br />
under the Securities Act.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We understand that the Exchange and the issuance of<br /><br />
the Securities have not been registered under the<br /><br />
Securities Act, and that the Securities may not be<br /><br />
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for<br /><br />
the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as<br /><br />
permitted in the following sentence. We agree, on our<br /><br />
own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which we<br /><br />
are acting as hereinafter stated, that if we should<br /><br />
sell any Securities, we will do so only (i) to the<br /><br />
Company or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) inside the<br /><br />
United States in accordance with Rule 144A under the<br /><br />
Securities Act to a "qualified institutional buyer" (as<br /><br />
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) that,<br /><br />
prior to such transfer furnishes (or has furnished on<br /><br />
its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the Warrant<br /><br />
Agent (as defined in the New Warrant) if other than the<br /><br />
Company, and to the Company, a signed letter containing<br /><br />
certain<br /><br />
representations, warranties and agreements<br /><br />
relating to the restrictions on transfer of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Securities (the form of which letter can be obtained<br /><br />
from the Company), (iii) outside the United States in<br /><br />
accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S promulgated<br /><br />
under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to an exemption<br /><br />
from registration provided by Rule 144 under the<br /><br />
Securities Act (if available), or (v) pursuant to an<br /><br />
effective registration statement under the Securities<br /><br />
Act, and we further agree to provide to any person<br /><br />
purchasing any of the Securities from us a notice<br /><br />
advising such purchaser that resales of the Securities<br /><br />
are restricted as stated herein and in the New Warrant.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We understand that, on any proposed resale of the<br /><br />
Securities, and on any proposed exercise of the New<br /><br />
Warrant by a "foreign person", we (or such foreign<br /><br />
person) will be required to furnish to the Company and<br /><br />
the Warrant Agent (if other than the Company), such<br /><br />
certifications, legal opinions and other information as<br /><br />
they may reasonably require to confirm that<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
proposed sale or exercise complies with the foregoing<br /><br />
restrictions. We further understand that the Securities<br /><br />
acquired by us will bear a legend to the foregoing<br /><br />
effect.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We are an institutional "accredited investor" (as<br /><br />
defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or<br /><br />
(7)<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
Regulation D under the Securities Act) and have such<br /><br />
knowledge and experience in financial and business<br /><br />
matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and<br /><br />
risks of our investment in the Securities, and we and<br /><br />
any accounts for which we are acting are each able to<br /><br />
bear the economic risk of our or their investment, as<br /><br />
the case may be.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We<br /><br />
<br /><br />
are acquiring the Securities for our account<br /><br />
for one or more accounts (each of which is<br /><br />
institutional "accredited investor") as to each<br /><br />
which we exercise sole investment discretion.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
an<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We acknowledge and agree that the New Warrant will be<br /><br />
issued against delivery of the Old Warrants<br /><br />
(or<br /><br />
evidence<br /><br />
satisfactory to the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
their<br /><br />
guaranteed delivery) free and clear of all liens,<br /><br />
charges and encumbrances. We acknowledge and agree that<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
income tax consequences attributable to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Exchange and the acquisition of the Securities shall be<br /><br />
borne by the acquirer of the Securities. We represent<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and warrant to the Company that no broker-dealer or<br /><br />
other third party has been retained to act as agent for<br /><br />
or represent the undersigned in connection with the<br /><br />
Exchange and that no commission or other remuneration<br /><br />
is being paid or given, or is required to be paid or<br /><br />
given, directly or indirectly, in connection with the<br /><br />
Exchange. We agree, and each subsequent holder of the<br /><br />
New Warrant will agree to execute and deliver to the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
all such further notices, documentation and<br /><br />
certifications as may be required to be filed under<br /><br />
applicable securities and Federal and State income tax<br /><br />
laws, rules and regulations relating or attributable to<br /><br />
the Exchange, the issuance of the Securities or as the<br /><br />
Company may reasonably request<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company hereby represents, warrants and agrees<br /><br />
with you as follows: (i) in the event that on or prior<br /><br />
to March 15, 1999 the Company makes an offer to the<br /><br />
holders of warrants of the same class or issue as the<br /><br />
Old Warrants to either (x) exchange their warrants for<br /><br />
new warrants with an exercise price which is lower than<br /><br />
the Exercise Price of the New Warrant or (y) reduce the<br /><br />
exercise price of their warrants, or increase the<br /><br />
number of shares subject to such warrants, or both,<br /><br />
either by amendment of the terms of such warrants or<br /><br />
pursuant to the unilateral powers granted the Company<br /><br />
under the terms of such warrants, resulting in such<br /><br />
warrant holders being offered the right to acquire<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share<br /><br />
below the Exercise Price of the New Warrant, then the<br /><br />
Company shall offer the holder of the New Warrant the<br /><br />
right to acquire that number of shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
at a purchase price of $.01 per share which would<br /><br />
result in an effective reduction in the Exercise Price<br /><br />
of the New Warrant so that it equals such reduced<br /><br />
effective exercise price offered such other warrant<br /><br />
holders;<br /><br />
and (ii) the Warrant Shares<br /><br />
shall<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
considered "Registrable Securities", for purposes of<br /><br />
that certain Registration Rights Agreement dated May<br /><br />
20, 1997 (the benefits of which the Company hereby<br /><br />
agrees to extend to the holder of the New Warrant),<br /><br />
which the Company hereby agrees to include in the<br /><br />
Registration Statement on Form S-1 referred to in<br /><br />
paragraph<br /><br />
1<br /><br />
above pursuant to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
"Piggy-Back<br /><br />
Registration Rights" provisions of Section 8(a) of<br /><br />
such Agreement which are incorporated by reference<br /><br />
herein.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
You, the Warrant Agent and others are entitled to rely upon<br /><br />
this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter<br /><br />
or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or<br /><br />
legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters<br /><br />
covered hereby.<br /><br />

with the Warrants, the "Securities") upon surrender of this<br /><br />
warrant certificate (the "Certificate") and payment of the<br /><br />

the principal office of the Company presently located at 110 Rue<br /><br />
Jean Lafitte, Lafayette, LA 70508, United States of America.<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exercise of Warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The exercise of any Warrants represented<br /><br />

Section 3, "Compliance with Securities Laws."<br /><br />
<br /><br />
by<br /><br />

Subject to compliance with all of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conditions set forth herein, the Holder shall have the right at<br /><br />
any time and from time to time after September 15, 1998 to pur<br /><br />
chase from the Company the number of Shares which the Holder may<br /><br />
at the time be entitled to purchase pursuant hereto, upon<br /><br />
surrender of this Certificate to the Company at its principal<br /><br />
office, together with the form of election to purchase attached<br /><br />
hereto duly completed and signed, and upon payment to the Company<br /><br />
of the Purchase Price.<br /><br />
No Warrant may be exercised after 5:00 p.m., New York time,<br /><br />

hereby shall be void.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made in<br /><br />
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by<br /><br />
certified check or banker's draft payable to the order of the Com<br /><br />
pany, or any combination of the foregoing.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
The Warrants represented by this Certificate are<br /><br />
exercisable at the option of the Holder, in whole or in part (but<br /><br />
not as to fractional Shares). Upon the exercise of less than all<br /><br />
of the Warrants evidenced by this Certificate, the Company shall<br /><br />
forthwith issue to the Holder a new certificate of like tenor<br /><br />
representing the number of unexercised Warrants.<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
Subject to compliance with all of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conditions set forth herein, upon surrender of this Certificate<br /><br />
to the Company at its principal office, together with the form of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
election to purchase attached hereto duly completed and signed,<br /><br />
and upon payment of the Purchase Price, the Company shall cause<br /><br />
to be delivered promptly to or upon the written order of the<br /><br />
Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate, a<br /><br />
share certificate or share certificates for the number of whole<br /><br />
Shares purchased upon the exercise of the Warrants. Such share<br /><br />
certificate or share certificates representing the Shares shall<br /><br />
be free of any restrictive legend. The Company shall ensure that<br /><br />
no "stop transfer" or similar instruction or order with respect<br /><br />
to the Shares purchased upon exercise of the Warrants shall be in<br /><br />
effect at ChaseMellon Shareholders Services, IRG Plc or any suc<br /><br />
cessor transfer agent for the Common Stock of the Company (the<br /><br />
"Transfer Agent").<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all documen<br /><br />
tary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the issuance and<br /><br />
delivery of the Securities; provided, however, that the Company<br /><br />
shall not be required to pay any taxes which may be payable in<br /><br />
respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of<br /><br />
any Securities or any Shares in any name other than that of the<br /><br />
Holder, which transfer taxes shall be paid by the Holder, and<br /><br />
until payment of such transfer taxes, if any, the Company shall<br /><br />
not be required to issue such Securities.<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
Compliance with Securities Laws. The Securities<br /><br />
have not been, and are not required<br /><br />

United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or<br /><br />
any other securities or blue sky laws of any other domestic or<br /><br />
foreign jurisdiction (collectively, the "Securities Laws"). No<br /><br />
offer, sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition (collectively,<br /><br />
a "Disposal") of the Securities may be made unless (i) registered<br /><br />
under the Act and any other applicable Securities Laws or (ii)<br /><br />
the Company receives a written opinion of United States legal<br /><br />
counsel in form and substance satisfactory to it to the effect<br /><br />
that such Disposal is exempt from such registration requirements.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Transfer of Warrants.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The Warrants shall be transferable only on<br /><br />
the books of the Company maintained at the Company's principal<br /><br />
office upon delivery of this Certificate with the form of<br /><br />
assignment attached hereto duly completed and signed by the<br /><br />
Holder or by its duly authorized attorney or representative,<br /><br />
accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or<br /><br />
authority to transfer.<br /><br />
The Company may, in its discretion,<br /><br />
require, as a condition to any transfer of Warrants, a signature<br /><br />
guarantee, which may be provided by a commercial bank or trust<br /><br />
company, by a broker or dealer which is a member of the National<br /><br />
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or by a member of a<br /><br />
United States national securities exchange, The Securities and<br /><br />
Futures Authority Limited in the United Kingdom, or The London<br /><br />
Stock Exchange Limited in London, England. Upon any registration<br /><br />
of transfer, the Company shall deliver a new warrant certificate<br /><br />
or warrant certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the<br /><br />
aggregate a like number of Warrants to the person entitled<br /><br />
thereto in exchange for this Certificate, subject to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
limitations provided herein, without any charge except for any<br /><br />
tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Notwithstanding<br /><br />
anything<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
this<br /><br />
Certificate to the contrary, neither any of the Warrants nor any<br /><br />
of the Shares issuable upon exercise of any of the Warrants shall<br /><br />
be transferable, except upon compliance by the Holder with any<br /><br />
applicable provisions of the Act and any other applicable<br /><br />
Securities Laws.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Exchange and Replacement of Warrant<br /><br />
Certificates; Loss or Mutilation of<br /><br />
Warrant Certificates.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
This Certificate is exchangeable without cost,<br /><br />
upon the surrender hereof by the Holder at the principal office<br /><br />
of the Company, for new warrant certificates of like tenor and<br /><br />
date representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the same<br /><br />
number of Shares in such denominations as shall be designated by<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Holder at the time of such surrender. Any transfer not made<br /><br />
in such compliance shall be null and void and shall be given no<br /><br />
effect hereunder.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence<br /><br />
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or<br /><br />
mutilation of this Certificate and, in case of such loss, theft<br /><br />
or destruction, of indemnity and security reasonably satisfactory<br /><br />
to it, and reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable<br /><br />
expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation<br /><br />
of this Certificate, if mutilated, the Company will make and<br /><br />
deliver a new warrant certificate of like tenor, in lieu thereof.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of<br /><br />
Shares Issuable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The number and kind of Shares purchasable upon the exercise<br /><br />
of each Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to<br /><br />
adjustment from time to time as follows:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
Stock Splits, Combinations, etc. In case<br /><br />
the Company shall hereafter (A) pay a dividend or make a<br /><br />
distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital<br /><br />
stock (whether shares of Common Stock or of capital stock of<br /><br />
any other class), (B) subdivide its outstanding shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock or (C) combine its outstanding shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock into a smaller number of shares, the (a) number of<br /><br />
Shares purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant immediately<br /><br />
prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of any<br /><br />
Warrant thereafter exercised shall be entitled to receive<br /><br />
the number of Shares which such holder would have owned<br /><br />
immediately following such action had such Warrant been<br /><br />
exercised immediately prior thereto, and (b) the Exercise<br /><br />
Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price<br /><br />
immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, the<br /><br />
numerator of which shall be the number of Shares purchasable<br /><br />
upon the exercise of each Warrant immediately prior to such<br /><br />
adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number<br /><br />
of Shares purchasable immediately thereafter. An adjustment<br /><br />
made pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall become effective<br /><br />
immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend<br /><br />
and shall become effective immediately after the effective<br /><br />
date<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
the case of a subdivision, combination<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
reclassification.<br /><br />
If, as a result of an adjustment made<br /><br />
pursuant to this Section 6(a), the holder of any Warrant<br /><br />
thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive shares<br /><br />
of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the<br /><br />
Board of Directors of the Company (whose determination shall<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
conclusive) shall determine the allocation of the<br /><br />
adjusted Exercise Price between or among shares of such<br /><br />
classes of capital stock.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Reclassification, Combinations, Mergers,<br /><br />
etc.<br /><br />
In case of any reclassification or change<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than as set forth<br /><br />
in paragraph (a) above and other than a change in par value,<br /><br />
or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to<br /><br />
par value), or in case of any consolidation or merger of the<br /><br />
Company with or into another corporation or other entity<br /><br />
(other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing<br /><br />
corporation<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
which<br /><br />
does<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
result<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
reclassification or change of the then outstanding shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company (other<br /><br />
than a change in par value, or from par value to no par<br /><br />
value, or from no par value to par value or as a result of a<br /><br />
subdivision or combination)) or in case of any sale or<br /><br />
conveyance to another corporation or other entity of all or<br /><br />
substantially all of the assets of the Company, then, as a<br /><br />
condition of such reclassification, change, consolidation,<br /><br />
merger, sale or conveyance, the Company or such a successor<br /><br />
or purchasing corporation or other entity, as the case may<br /><br />
be, shall forthwith make lawful and adequate<br /><br />
provision<br /><br />
whereby the holder of such Warrant then outstanding shall<br /><br />
have the right thereafter to receive on exercise of such<br /><br />
Warrant the kind and amount of shares of stock and other<br /><br />
securities<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
property<br /><br />
receivable<br /><br />
upon<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or<br /><br />
conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant immediately<br /><br />
<br /><br />
prior<br /><br />
to such reclassification, change, consolidation,<br /><br />
merger,<br /><br />
sale or conveyance and enter into a warrant<br /><br />
amendment so providing. Such provisions shall<br /><br />
include<br /><br />
provision<br /><br />
for adjustments which shall be<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
nearly<br /><br />
equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided<br /><br />
for in this Section 6.<br /><br />
If the issuer of securities<br /><br />
deliverable upon exercise of Warrants under the supplemental<br /><br />
warrant agreement is an affiliate of the formed, surviving<br /><br />
or transferee corporation or other entity, that issuer shall<br /><br />
join in the supplemental warrant agreement.<br /><br />
The above<br /><br />
provisions of this Section 6 (b) shall similarly apply to<br /><br />
successive reclassifications and changes of shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock and to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or<br /><br />
conveyances.<br /><br />
In case of any such reclassification, merger,<br /><br />
consolidation or disposition of assets, the successor or<br /><br />
acquiring corporation or other entity (if other than the<br /><br />
Company)<br /><br />
shall expressly assume the due and punctual<br /><br />
observance and performance of each and every covenant and<br /><br />
condition of this Warrant to be performed and observed by<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
and all the obligations and liabilities<br /><br />
hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed<br /><br />
appropriate (as determined by resolution of the Board of<br /><br />
Directors<br /><br />
of the Company) in order to<br /><br />
provide<br /><br />
for<br /><br />
adjustments of shares of the Common Stock for which each<br /><br />
Warrant is exercisable, which shall be as nearly equivalent<br /><br />
as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this<br /><br />
Section 6.<br /><br />
The foregoing provisions of this Section 6(b)<br /><br />
shall<br /><br />
similarly<br /><br />
apply to successive<br /><br />
reorganizations,<br /><br />
reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or dispositions<br /><br />
of assets.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
Issuance of Options or Convertible<br /><br />
Securities. In the event the Company shall, at any time or<br /><br />
from time to time after the date hereof, issue, sell,<br /><br />
distribute or otherwise grant in any manner (including by<br /><br />
assumption) to all holders of the Common Stock any rights to<br /><br />
subscribe for or to purchase, or any warrants or options for<br /><br />
the purchase of, Common Stock or any stock or securities<br /><br />
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (any such<br /><br />
rights, warrants or options being herein called "Options"<br /><br />
and any such convertible or exchangeable stock or securities<br /><br />
being<br /><br />
herein called "Convertible Securities") or<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
Convertible Securities (other than upon exercise of any<br /><br />
Option), whether or not such Options or the rights to<br /><br />
convert<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
exchange such Convertible Securities<br /><br />
are<br /><br />
immediately exercisable, and the price per share at which<br /><br />
Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options<br /><br />
or upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible<br /><br />
Securities (determined by dividing (i) the aggregate amount,<br /><br />
if<br /><br />
any,<br /><br />
received or receivable by the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
consideration for the issuance, sale, distribution<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
granting of such Options or any such Convertible Security,<br /><br />
plus<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
minimum<br /><br />
aggregate<br /><br />
amount<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
additional<br /><br />
consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the<br /><br />
exercise of all such Options or upon conversion or exchange<br /><br />
of all such Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of<br /><br />
Options to acquire Convertible Securities, the minimum<br /><br />
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if<br /><br />
any,<br /><br />
payable upon the conversion or exchange of all<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
Convertible Securities, by (ii) the total maximum number of<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all<br /><br />
such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such<br /><br />
Convertible Securities or upon the conversion or exchange of<br /><br />
all Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of all<br /><br />
Options) shall be less than the current Market Price per<br /><br />
Share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 6(f))<br /><br />
on the record date for the issuance, sale, distribution or<br /><br />
granting of such Options (any such event being herein called<br /><br />
a "Distribution") then, effective upon such Distribution,<br /><br />
the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price (calculated<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
nearest 1/1,000 of one cent) determined<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior<br /><br />
to such Distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which<br /><br />
shall be the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
outstanding (exclusive of any treasury shares) immediately<br /><br />
prior to such Distribution multiplied by the current Market<br /><br />
Price per Share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to<br /><br />
Section 6(f)) on the date of such Distribution plus (ii) the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
consideration, if any, received by the Company upon such<br /><br />
Distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the<br /><br />
product of (A) the total number of shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
outstanding (exclusive of any treasury shares) immediately<br /><br />
after such Distribution multiplied by (B) the current Market<br /><br />
Price per Share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to<br /><br />
Section 6(f)) on the record date for such Distribution. For<br /><br />
purposes of the foregoing, the total maximum number of<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of all such<br /><br />
Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all such<br /><br />
Convertible Securities or upon the conversion or exchange of<br /><br />
the total maximum amount of the Convertible Securities<br /><br />
issuable upon the exercise of all such Options shall be<br /><br />
deemed to have been issued as of the date of<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
Distribution<br /><br />
and thereafter shall be<br /><br />
deemed<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
outstanding and the Company shall be deemed to have received<br /><br />
as consideration therefor such price per share, determined<br /><br />
as provided above. Except as provided in Sections 6(i) and<br /><br />
(j) below, no additional adjustment of the Exercise Price<br /><br />
shall be made upon the actual exercise of such Options or<br /><br />
upon conversion or exchange of the Convertible Securities or<br /><br />
upon<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
conversion or exchange of the<br /><br />
Convertible<br /><br />
Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6 to the contrary,<br /><br />
neither the payment of dividends on any shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock in additional shares of Amended<br /><br />
Series A Preferred Stock, nor the issuance of shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock on conversion of the Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock, nor the issuance of shares of Common Stock in payment<br /><br />
of any dividends due on any shares of Preferred Stock of the<br /><br />
Company outstanding on the Issue Date, nor on redemption of<br /><br />
any such shares, nor in payment of any interest due under<br /><br />
the Company's Secured Subordinated Notes, nor upon exercise<br /><br />
of any options granted to management pursuant to an employee<br /><br />
benefit plan approved by stockholders of the Company, nor<br /><br />
upon the exercise of any outstanding Warrants (including<br /><br />
Warrants issued in the Concurrent Debt Offering (as defined<br /><br />
below)), shall require any adjustment to either the Exercise<br /><br />
Price of the Warrants or the number of shares issuable upon<br /><br />
exercise of the Warrants.<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
Dividends and Distributions. In the event<br /><br />
the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after<br /><br />
the date hereof, distribute to all the holders of Common<br /><br />
Stock any dividends or other distribution of cash, evidences<br /><br />
of its indebtedness, other securities or other properties or<br /><br />
assets (in each case other than (i) dividends payable in<br /><br />
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities and (ii) any<br /><br />
cash dividend from current or retained earnings), or any<br /><br />
options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or<br /><br />
purchase any of the foregoing, then (A) the Exercise Price<br /><br />
shall be decreased to a price determined by multiplying the<br /><br />
Exercise Price then in effect by a fraction, the numerator<br /><br />
of which shall be the current Market Price per Share of<br /><br />
Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 6(f)) on the<br /><br />
record date for such distribution less the sum of (X) the<br /><br />
cash portion, if any, of such distribution per share of<br /><br />
Common Stock outstanding (exclusive of any treasury shares)<br /><br />
on the record date for such distribution plus (Y) the then<br /><br />
fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board<br /><br />
of Directors of the Company) per share of Common Stock<br /><br />
outstanding (exclusive of any treasury shares) on the record<br /><br />
date for such distribution of that portion, if any, of such<br /><br />
distribution consisting of evidences of indebtedness, other<br /><br />
securities, properties, assets (other than cash), options,<br /><br />
warrants or subscription or purchase rights, and<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
denominator of which shall be such current market price per<br /><br />
share<br /><br />
of Common Stock and (B) the number of Shares<br /><br />
purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant shall be<br /><br />
increased to a number determined by multiplying the number<br /><br />
of shares of Common Stock so purchasable immediately prior<br /><br />
to the record date for such distribution by a fraction, the<br /><br />
numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price in effect<br /><br />
immediately prior to the adjustment required by clause (A)<br /><br />
of this sentence and the denominator of which shall be the<br /><br />
Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment.<br /><br />
The adjustments required by this Section 6(d) shall be made<br /><br />
whenever any such distribution occurs retroactive to the<br /><br />
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled<br /><br />
to receive such distribution.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
Self-Tenders. In case of the consummation<br /><br />
of a tender or exchange offer (other than an odd-lot tender<br /><br />
offer) made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company<br /><br />
for all or any portion of the Common Stock to the extent<br /><br />
that the cash and value of any other consideration included<br /><br />
in such payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the first<br /><br />
reported sales price per share of Common Stock on the<br /><br />
trading day next succeeding the last time tenders or<br /><br />
exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or exchange<br /><br />
offer (the "Expiration Time"), the Exercise Price shall be<br /><br />
reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by<br /><br />
multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior<br /><br />
to the Expiration Time by a fraction, the numerator of which<br /><br />
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding<br /><br />
(including any tendered or exchanged shares)<br /><br />
at<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Expiration Time multiplied by the first reported sales price<br /><br />
of the Common Stock on the trading day next succeeding the<br /><br />
Expiration Time, and the denominator of which shall be the<br /><br />
sum of (A) the fair market value (determined by the Board of<br /><br />
Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be<br /><br />
conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of<br /><br />
Directors)<br /><br />
of the aggregate consideration payable<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum<br /><br />
specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of<br /><br />
all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn<br /><br />
as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up<br /><br />
to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased<br /><br />
Shares") and (B) the product of the number of shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) on the<br /><br />
Expiration Time and the first reported sales price of the<br /><br />
Common Stock on the trading day next succeeding<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Expiration<br /><br />
Time,<br /><br />
such reduction to become<br /><br />
effective<br /><br />
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day<br /><br />
following the Expiration Time.<br /><br />
(f)<br /><br />
Current Market Price. For the purpose of<br /><br />
any computation of current market price, the current "Market<br /><br />
Price per Share of Common Stock" at any date shall be (x)<br /><br />
for purposes of Section 7 herein (dealing with fractional<br /><br />
interests), the closing price on the trading day immediately<br /><br />
prior to the exercise of the applicable Warrant and (y) in<br /><br />
all other cases, the average of the daily closing prices for<br /><br />
the shorter of (i) the 20 consecutive trading days ending on<br /><br />
the last full trading day on the exchange or market<br /><br />
specified in the second succeeding sentence prior to the<br /><br />
Time of Determination (as defined below) and (ii) the period<br /><br />
commencing on the date next succeeding the first public<br /><br />
announcement of the issuance, sale, distribution or granting<br /><br />
in question through such last full trading day prior to the<br /><br />
Time of Determination. The term "Time of Determination" as<br /><br />
used herein shall be the time and date of the earlier to<br /><br />
occur of (A) the date as of which the current market price<br /><br />
is to be computed and (B) the last full trading day on such<br /><br />
exchange or market before the commencement of "ex-dividend"<br /><br />
trading in the Common Stock relating to the event giving<br /><br />
rise to the adjustment required by paragraph (a), (b), (c)<br /><br />
or (d).<br /><br />
The closing price for any day shall be the last<br /><br />
reported sale price regular way or, in case no such reported<br /><br />
sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid<br /><br />
and asked prices regular way for such day, in each case (1)<br /><br />
on the principal national securities exchange on which the<br /><br />
shares of Common Stock are listed or to which such shares<br /><br />
are admitted to trading or (2) if the Common Stock is not<br /><br />
listed or admitted to trading on a national securities<br /><br />
exchange, in the over-the-counter market as reported by the<br /><br />
Nasdaq NMS or any comparable system or (3) if the Common<br /><br />
Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq NMS or a comparable<br /><br />
system, as furnished by two members of the American Stock<br /><br />
Exchange, Inc. selected from time to time in good faith by<br /><br />
the Board of Directors of the Company for that purpose.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
the absence of all of the foregoing, or if for any other<br /><br />
reason the current Market Price per Share cannot<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this<br /><br />
Section 6(f), the current Market Price per Share shall be<br /><br />
the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by<br /><br />
the Board of Directors of the Company.<br /><br />
shall<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(g)<br /><br />
Certain Distributions. If the Company<br /><br />
pay a dividend or make any other distribution payable<br /><br />
<br /><br />
in Options or Convertible Securities, then, for purposes of<br /><br />
paragraph (c) above, such Options or Convertible Securities<br /><br />
shall be deemed to have been issued or sold without<br /><br />
consideration.<br /><br />
(h)<br /><br />
Consideration Received. If any shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities shall be<br /><br />
issued, sold or distributed for a consideration other than<br /><br />
cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash<br /><br />
received by the Company in respect thereof shall be deemed<br /><br />
to be the then fair market value of such consideration (as<br /><br />
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the<br /><br />
Company). If any Options shall be issued in connection with<br /><br />
the issuance and sale of other securities of the Company,<br /><br />
together comprising one integral transaction in which no<br /><br />
specific consideration is allocated to such Options by the<br /><br />
parties thereto, such Options shall be deemed to have been<br /><br />
issued without consideration; provided, however, that if<br /><br />
such Options have an exercise price equal to or greater than<br /><br />
the current Market Price per Share of the Common Stock on<br /><br />
the date of issuance of such Options, then such Options<br /><br />
shall be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal<br /><br />
to such exercise price.<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
Deferral of Certain Adjustments.<br /><br />
No<br /><br />
adjustment to the Exercise Price (including the related<br /><br />
adjustment to the number of Shares purchasable upon the<br /><br />
exercise of each Warrant) shall be required hereunder unless<br /><br />
such adjustment, together with other adjustments carried<br /><br />
forward as provided below, would result in an increase or<br /><br />
decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Exercise Price;<br /><br />
provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of<br /><br />
this paragraph (i) are not required to be made shall be<br /><br />
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent<br /><br />
adjustment. No adjustment need be made for a change in the<br /><br />
par value of the Common Stock. All calculations under this<br /><br />
Section 6 shall be made to the nearest 1/1,000 of one cent<br /><br />
or to the nearest l/1,000th of a Share, as the case may be.<br /><br />
(j)<br /><br />
Changes in Options and Convertible<br /><br />
Securities.<br /><br />
If the exercise price provided for in any<br /><br />
Options referred to in Section 6(c) above, the additional<br /><br />
consideration, if any, payable upon the conversion or<br /><br />
exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in<br /><br />
Section 6(c) above, or the rate at which any Convertible<br /><br />
Securities referred to in Section 6(c) above are convertible<br /><br />
into or exchangeable for Common Stock shall change at any<br /><br />
time (other than under or by reason of provisions designed<br /><br />
to protect against dilution upon an event which results in a<br /><br />
related adjustment pursuant to this Section 6), the Exercise<br /><br />
Price then in effect and the number of Shares purchasable<br /><br />
upon the exercise of each Warrant shall forthwith be<br /><br />
readjusted (effective only with respect to any exercise of<br /><br />
any Warrant after such readjustment) to the Exercise Price<br /><br />
and number of Shares so purchasable that would then be in<br /><br />
effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance, sale,<br /><br />
distribution or granting of such Options or Convertible<br /><br />
Securities been made based upon such changed purchase price,<br /><br />
additional consideration or conversion rate, as the case may<br /><br />
be, but only with respect to such Options and Convertible<br /><br />
Securities as then remain outstanding.<br /><br />
(k)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Expiration of Options and Convertible<br /><br />
Securities.<br /><br />
If, at any time after any adjustment to the<br /><br />
number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each<br /><br />
Warrant shall have been made pursuant to Sections 6(c) or<br /><br />
(j) above or this Section 6(k), any Options or Convertible<br /><br />
Securities shall have expired unexercised, the number of<br /><br />
such Shares so purchasable shall, upon such Expiration, be<br /><br />
readjusted and shall thereafter be such as they would have<br /><br />
been had they been originally adjusted (or had the original<br /><br />
adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if (i)<br /><br />
the only shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued<br /><br />
in connection with such Options or Convertible Securities<br /><br />
were the shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or<br /><br />
sold upon the exercise of such Options or Convertible<br /><br />
Securities and (ii) such shares of Common Stock, if any,<br /><br />
were issued or sold for the consideration actually received<br /><br />
by the Company upon such exercise plus the aggregate<br /><br />
consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the issuance, sale, distribution or granting of all such<br /><br />
Options or Convertible Securities, whether or not exercised;<br /><br />
provided, however, that no such readjustment shall have the<br /><br />
effect<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
decreasing the number of such shares<br /><br />
so<br /><br />
purchasable by an amount (calculated by adjusting such<br /><br />
decrease to account for all other adjustments made pursuant<br /><br />
to this Section 6 following the date of the original<br /><br />
adjustment referred to above) in excess of the amount of the<br /><br />
adjustment initially made in respect of the issuance, sale,<br /><br />
distribution or granting of such Options or Convertible<br /><br />
Securities.<br /><br />
(l)<br /><br />
Other Adjustments. In the event that at<br /><br />
any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this<br /><br />
Section 6, holders of Warrants shall become entitled to<br /><br />
receive any securities of the Company other than shares of<br /><br />
Common Stock, including shares of Amended Series A Preferred<br /><br />
Stock as provided in Section 6(o) below, thereafter the<br /><br />
number of such other securities so receivable upon exercise<br /><br />
of each Warrant and the Exercise Price applicable to such<br /><br />
exercise shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in<br /><br />
a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to<br /><br />
the provisions with respect to the Shares of Common Stock<br /><br />
contained in this Section 6.<br /><br />
(m)<br /><br />
Other Action Affecting Common Stock.<br /><br />
In<br /><br />
case at any time or from time to time the Company shall take<br /><br />
any action in respect of its outstanding shares of Common<br /><br />
Stock, then the number of Shares for which each Warrant is<br /><br />
exercisable shall be adjusted in such manner as may be<br /><br />
equitable in the circumstances. If the Company shall at any<br /><br />
time and from time to time issue or sell (i) any shares of<br /><br />
any class of common stock other than Common Stock, (ii) any<br /><br />
evidences of its indebtedness, shares of stock or other<br /><br />
securities which are convertible into or exchangeable for<br /><br />
such shares of common stock, with or without the payment of<br /><br />
additional consideration in cash or property, or (iii) any<br /><br />
warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any<br /><br />
such shares of common stock or any such evidences, shares of<br /><br />
stock or other securities referred to in (ii) above, then in<br /><br />
each such case such issuance shall be deemed to be of, or in<br /><br />
respect of, Common Stock for purposes of this Section 6;<br /><br />
provided, however, that, without limiting the generality of<br /><br />
the foregoing, if the Company shall take a record of the<br /><br />
holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling<br /><br />
them to receive a dividend payable in, or other distribution<br /><br />
of, common stock other than Common Stock, including shares<br /><br />
of non-voting common stock, then the number of Shares for<br /><br />
which each Warrant is exercisable immediately after the<br /><br />
occurrence of any such event shall be adjusted to equal the<br /><br />
aggregate number of shares of such common stock and of<br /><br />
Common Stock which a record holder of the same number of<br /><br />
Shares for which each Warrant is exercisable immediately<br /><br />
prior to the occurrence of such event would own or be<br /><br />
entitled to receive after the happening of such event.<br /><br />
(n)<br /><br />
Statement of Warrant<br /><br />
Certificates.<br /><br />
Irrespective of any adjustment in the number or kind of<br /><br />
Shares issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant or the<br /><br />
Exercise<br /><br />
Price,<br /><br />
Warrant Certificates<br /><br />
theretofore<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
thereafter issued shall continue to express the same number<br /><br />
and kind of Shares and Exercise Price as are stated in the<br /><br />
Warrant Certificates initially issuable pursuant to this<br /><br />
Agreement.<br /><br />
(o)<br /><br />
Increased Shares or Reduced Exercise Price.<br /><br />
From time to time, the Company may, for a period of not less than<br /><br />
20 days, in its discretion, increase the number of Shares<br /><br />
purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant, without making any<br /><br />
adjustment to the Exercise Price, or reduce the Exercise Price,<br /><br />
without making any adjustment to the number of Shares purchasable<br /><br />
upon the exercise of this Warrant. The Company hereby represents,<br /><br />
warrants and agrees with you as follows: (i) in the event that on<br /><br />
or prior to the expiration of this Warrant the Company makes an<br /><br />
offer to the holders of warrants dated May 20, 1997 issued<br /><br />
pursuant to a Warrant Agreement dated such date ("Old Warrants")<br /><br />
to either (x) exchange their Old Warrants for new warrants with<br /><br />
an exercise price which is lower than the Exercise Price of this<br /><br />
Warrant or (y) reduce the exercise price of the Old Warrants, or<br /><br />
increase the number of shares subject to such Warrants, or both,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
either by amendment of the terms of such Warrants or pursuant to<br /><br />
the unilateral powers granted the Company under the terms of such<br /><br />
Warrants, resulting in such Warrant holders being offered the<br /><br />
right to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per<br /><br />
share below the Exercise Price of this Warrant, then the Company<br /><br />
shall offer the holder of this Warrant the right to acquire that<br /><br />
number of shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $.01 per<br /><br />
share which would result<br /><br />
in an effective reduction in the<br /><br />
Exercise Price of this Warrant so that it equals such reduced<br /><br />
effective exercise price offered such holders of Old Warrants;<br /><br />
and (ii) the Warrant Shares shall be considered "Registrable<br /><br />
Securities", for purposes of that certain Registration Rights<br /><br />
Agreement dated May 20, 1997 (the benefits of which the Company<br /><br />
hereby agrees to extend to the holder of this Warrant), which the<br /><br />
Company hereby agrees to include in the Registration Statement on<br /><br />
Form S-1 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange<br /><br />
Commission on May 8, 1998 (File No. 333-51937) pursuant to the<br /><br />
"Piggy-Back Registration Rights" provisions of Section 8(a) of<br /><br />
such Agreement which are incorporated by reference herein.<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
Fractional Interest. The Company shall not<br /><br />
be required to issue fractional shares of Common Stock on the<br /><br />
exercise of Warrants.<br /><br />
If more than one Warrant shall be<br /><br />
presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same<br /><br />
holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be<br /><br />
issuable upon such exercise shall be computed on the basis of the<br /><br />
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock acquirable on exercise<br /><br />
of the Warrants so presented. If any fraction of a share of<br /><br />
Common Stock would, except for the provisions of this Section 7,<br /><br />
be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant, the Company shall<br /><br />
either (i) pay an amount in cash calculated by the Company to<br /><br />
equal the then current Market Price per Share (determined<br /><br />
pursuant to Section 6(f)) multiplied by such fraction computed to<br /><br />
the nearest whole cent or (ii) aggregate all such fractional<br /><br />
shares into a whole number of shares and sell such aggregated<br /><br />
fractional shares on behalf of the holders entitled thereto in a<br /><br />
public or private sale and distribute the net cash proceeds from<br /><br />
the sale thereof to such holders pro rata. While the Company<br /><br />
will endeavor to use its best efforts to secure the best<br /><br />
available sales price for such aggregated fractional shares, such<br /><br />
price shall not necessarily be the highest price obtainable for<br /><br />
such shares. Holders of Warrants, by their acceptances of this<br /><br />
Warrant Certificate, expressly waive any and all rights to<br /><br />
receive any fraction of a share of Common Stock or a stock<br /><br />
certificate or scrip representing a fraction of a share of Common<br /><br />
Stock.<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
Notices to Warrant Holders. Nothing contained<br /><br />
in this Certificate shall be construed as conferring upon the<br /><br />
Holder the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a<br /><br />
stockholder in respect of any meetings of stockholders for the<br /><br />
election of directors or any other matter, or as having any<br /><br />
rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company. If, however,<br /><br />
at any time prior to the exercise or expiration of the Warrants,<br /><br />
any of the following events shall occur:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the holders of shares of the Common Stock shall<br /><br />
be entitled to receive a dividend or distribution<br /><br />
payable otherwise than in cash, or a cash dividend<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
distribution payable otherwise than out of<br /><br />
current or retained earnings, as indicated by the<br /><br />
accounting treatment of such dividend<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
dis<br /><br />
tribution on the books of the Company; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
the Company shall offer to all the holders of<br /><br />
its Common Stock any additional shares of capital<br /><br />
stock of the Company or securities convertible into<br /><br />
or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of the<br /><br />
Company, or any option, right or warrant to sub<br /><br />
scribe therefor; or<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of<br /><br />
the Company (other than in connection with<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
consolidation or merger) or a sale of all or sub<br /><br />
stantially all of its property, assets and business<br /><br />
as an entirety shall be approved by the Company's<br /><br />
Board of Directors; or<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
there shall be any capital reorganization<br /><br />
<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
reclassification of the capital stock<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company (other than a change in the number of<br /><br />
outstanding shares of Common Stock or a change in<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
par<br /><br />
value<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Common<br /><br />
Stock),<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
consolidation or merger of the Company with another<br /><br />
entity;<br /><br />
then, in any one or more of said events, the Company shall give<br /><br />
written notice of such event at least fifteen (15) days prior to<br /><br />
the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the<br /><br />
transfer books for the determination of the stockholders entitled<br /><br />
to such dividend, distribution, convertible or exchangeable secur<br /><br />
ities or subscription rights, options or warrants, or entitled to<br /><br />
vote on such proposed dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or<br /><br />
sale. Such notice shall specify such record date or the date of<br /><br />
closing the transfer books, as the case may be. Failure to give<br /><br />
such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity<br /><br />
of any action taken in connection with the declaration or payment<br /><br />
of any such dividend or distribution, or the issuance of any<br /><br />
convertible or exchangeable securities or subscription rights,<br /><br />
options or warrants, or any proposed dissolution, liquidation,<br /><br />
winding-up or sale.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Reservation and Listing of Securities.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Company covenants and agrees that at all times during<br /><br />
the period after September 15, 1998, the Company shall reserve<br /><br />
and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its auth<br /><br />
orized and unissued shares of Common Stock or out of its<br /><br />
authorized and issued shares of Common Stock held in its<br /><br />
treasury, solely for the purpose of issuance upon exercise of the<br /><br />
Warrants, such number of Shares as shall be issuable upon the<br /><br />
exercise of the Warrants.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
The Company covenants and agrees that, upon<br /><br />
exercise of the Warrants in accordance with their terms and<br /><br />
payment of the Purchase Price, all Shares issued or sold upon<br /><br />
such exercise shall not be subject to the preemptive rights of<br /><br />
any stockholder and when issued and delivered in accordance with<br /><br />
the terms of the Warrants shall be duly and validly issued, fully<br /><br />
paid and non-assessable, and the Holder shall receive good and<br /><br />
valid title to such Shares free and clear from any adverse claim<br /><br />
(as defined in the applicable Uniform Commercial Code), except<br /><br />
such as have been created by the Holder.<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
As long as the Warrants shall be outstanding,<br /><br />
the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause all Shares<br /><br />
issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants to be quoted by or<br /><br />
listed on any national securities exchange or other securities<br /><br />
listing service on which the shares of Common Stock of the<br /><br />
Company are then listed.<br /><br />

sale and purchase of the Warrants and the Shares (and any other<br /><br />

at law of the Holder, in the event of any default or threatened<br /><br />
default by the Company in the performance of or compliance with<br /><br />

<br /><br />
use his best efforts, skill and abilities so long as Consultant's<br /><br />
Services are retained hereunder to promote the best interest of<br /><br />
Company and its business. As part of the consideration for the<br /><br />

During the term of this<br /><br />

acknowledges that Consultant will receive sufficiently high<br /><br />
remuneration and other benefits from the Company hereunder to<br /><br />
justify such restrictions. The Company shall be entitled to<br /><br />
enforce the provisions of this Section 1.8 by resorting to<br /><br />
appropriate legal and equitable action.<br /><br />
It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company and<br /><br />
Consultant consider the restrictions contained in this Section<br /><br />

and protecting the goodwill and Confidential Information and<br /><br />
proprietary information of the Company. Nevertheless, if any of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
aforesaid restrictions are found by a<br /><br />
court<br /><br />
having<br /><br />
jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or over broad as to geographic<br /><br />
area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for<br /><br />
the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such court<br /><br />

then outstanding securities; provided, further, however, that<br /><br />
acquisition of 33a% or more of such combined voting power shall<br /><br />
not constitute a "change in control of XCL" if (1) such combined<br /><br />
voting power does not exceed 372% or more of the combined voting<br /><br />
power of XCL's then outstanding securities, and (2) either (i) to<br /><br />
the extent any such increase in a Major Stockholder's beneficial<br /><br />
ownership results from a redemption or purchase by XCL of its<br /><br />
securities, or (ii) if the Board of Directors of XCL, by vote of<br /><br />
two-thirds (b) of the full Board, in good faith, determines<br /><br />
(hereinafter referred to as a "Determination") both (A) that such<br /><br />
acquisition does not constitute, in fact, a change in the control<br /><br />
of XCL and (B) that such Major Stockholder does not and cannot<br /><br />
then control XCL or (Z) during any period of two consecutive<br /><br />
years prior to the date of such Determination, individuals who at<br /><br />
the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors<br /><br />
cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof,<br /><br />
unless the election of each director who was not a director at<br /><br />
the beginning of such period has been approved in advance by<br /><br />
directors representing at least two-thirds of the directors then<br /><br />
in office who were directors at the beginning of the period.<br /><br />
Further notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or the<br /><br />
Plan to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a "change in control<br /><br />
of XCL" and the lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions on the<br /><br />
Shares resulting therefrom, Grantee shall have the right at any<br /><br />
time during the sixty-day period immediately following such<br /><br />
"change<br /><br />
in control of XCL" to require the Company to purchase<br /><br />
from Grantee at their then Fair Market Value up to 40% (as<br /><br />
elected by Grantee) of the Shares as to which the Forfeiture<br /><br />
Restrictions lapsed as a result of such "change in control of<br /><br />
XCL". Grantee shall exercise the put option provided pursuant to<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
preceding sentence by written notice to the<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
specifying the number of Shares which Grantee demands that the<br /><br />
Company purchase. The purchase price for Shares purchased by the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Company<br /><br />
from Grantee pursuant to the put option provided<br /><br />
hereunder shall be paid in cash and in full no later than thirty<br /><br />
days after the date of Grantee's notice to Company of Grantee's<br /><br />
exercise of the put option provided herein and tender of the<br /><br />
Shares as to which such put option is being exercised.<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
Adjustments on Recapitalization.<br /><br />
The number of<br /><br />
Shares subject hereto shall be proportionately adjusted for any<br /><br />
increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting<br /><br />
from the subdivision or consolidation of Shares, or the payment<br /><br />
of a stock dividend on the Shares or increase in the Shares<br /><br />
outstanding effected without receipt of consideration by the<br /><br />
Company, provided that any fractional Shares resulting from such<br /><br />
adjustments shall be eliminated.<br /><br />
If the Company shall at any time merge or consolidate with<br /><br />
or into another corporation, Grantee (or other party entitled to<br /><br />
the Award) will thereafter receive the securities or property to<br /><br />
which a holder of the number of Shares then deliverable upon the<br /><br />
lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions of the Award would have been<br /><br />
entitled upon such merger or consolidation, and the Company shall<br /><br />
take such steps in connection with such merger or consolidation<br /><br />
as may be necessary to assure that provisions of the Plan shall<br /><br />
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in<br /><br />
relation to any securities or property thereafter deliverable<br /><br />
upon lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions of the Award. A sale<br /><br />
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for a<br /><br />
consideration<br /><br />
(apart from the assumption<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
obligations)<br /><br />
constituted primarily of securities shall be deemed a merger or<br /><br />
consolidation for the foregoing purposes. In the event of the<br /><br />
proposed dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company, other than pursuant to a merger or consolidation as<br /><br />
hereinabove provided, the Forfeiture Restrictions on the Award<br /><br />
shall terminate as of a date to be fixed by the Company's<br /><br />
Compensation Advisory Committee; provided that not less than 120<br /><br />
days (or such shorter period as shall elapse between the date the<br /><br />
Board of Directors shall decide upon a dissolution, liquidation<br /><br />
or reorganization and the effective date of such dissolution,<br /><br />
liquidation or reorganization) prior written notice shall be<br /><br />
given to Grantee and Grantee shall have the right, during such<br /><br />
period, to receive unrestricted Shares covered by the Award,<br /><br />
including Shares granted pursuant to the Award as to which the<br /><br />
Forfeiture Restrictions would not otherwise have lapsed.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Status of Shares.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The Grantee agrees that (i) the Shares will not<br /><br />
be sold or otherwise disposed of in any manner which would<br /><br />
constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state laws,<br /><br />
(ii) the certificates representing the Shares shall bear such<br /><br />
legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to<br /><br />
reflect the Forfeiture Restrictions and to assure compliance with<br /><br />
applicable securities laws, (iii) the Company may refuse to<br /><br />
register the transfer of the Shares on the stock transfer records<br /><br />
of the Company if such proposed transfer would constitute a<br /><br />
violation of the Forfeiture Restrictions or, in the opinion of<br /><br />
counsel satisfactory to the Company, any applicable securities<br /><br />
laws, and (iv) the Company may give related instructions to its<br /><br />
transfer agent, if any, to stop registration of the transfer of<br /><br />
Shares.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
As the Forfeiture Restrictions on the Award are<br /><br />
released, a certificate without the legend describing such<br /><br />
Forfeiture Restrictions and evidencing the number of Shares with<br /><br />
respect to which restrictions have been released will<br /><br />
be<br /><br />
delivered to the Grantee as soon as practicable.<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
Subject to Plan. The Award granted hereunder has<br /><br />
been issued under the Plan and is specifically subject to and<br /><br />
conditioned upon approval by the stockholders of the Company of<br /><br />
the June 1, 1997 amendment and restatement of the Plan and shall<br /><br />
be null and void ab initio if such approval is not obtained. In<br /><br />
addition to the provisions hereof, this Award will be subject to<br /><br />
the power under the Plan of the Company's Compensation Advisory<br /><br />
Committee and the Board of Directors to make interpretations of<br /><br />
the Plan and of any awards granted thereunder, and to make<br /><br />
determinations and take other actions with respect to the Plan;<br /><br />
provided,<br /><br />
however,<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
if<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
interpretations,<br /><br />
determinations or other actions shall conflict with any of the<br /><br />
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions shall<br /><br />
hereof<br /><br />
<br /><br />
control. By acceptance hereof, Grantee acknowledges receipt of a<br /><br />
copy of the Plan and recognizes and agrees that determinations,<br /><br />
interpretations or other actions respecting the Plan may be made<br /><br />
by a majority of the Board of Directors or by the Compensation<br /><br />
Advisory Committee.<br /><br />

the limitations imposed by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
"Act"), the Exchange Act, state securities or Blue Sky<br /><br />
laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder (in particular,<br /><br />
Rule 144, promulgated under the Act and Section 16 of the<br /><br />
Exchange Act, and Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder), concerning<br /><br />
the restricted stock awarded under this Agreement and agrees to<br /><br />
be bound by the restrictions embodied in such Act, the Exchange<br /><br />
Act, state securities or Blue Sky laws, and all the rules and<br /><br />
regulations promulgated thereunder.<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
Grantee a Stockholder. Grantee shall be entitled to<br /><br />
all rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right<br /><br />
to vote and to receive all dividends and other distributions made<br /><br />
or paid with respect to the Shares.<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
The Company's Right to Terminate Employment. Nothing<br /><br />
contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Grantee the right<br /><br />
to employment by the Company or any of its affiliates.<br /><br />
9.<br /><br />
Withholding. Grantee hereby agrees that he will make<br /><br />
such arrangements as the Company deems necessary to discharge any<br /><br />
federal, state or local taxes imposed upon the Company in respect<br /><br />
of this Award.<br /><br />
10.<br /><br />
Entire Agreement.<br /><br />
This Agreement contains the<br /><br />

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT<br /><br />
XCL LTD., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "XCL"),<br /><br />
effective as of the []st day of [], 199[], hereby irrevocably<br /><br />
grants to [] ("Optionee") in consideration of services rendered<br /><br />
and to be rendered by the Optionee, the right and option (the<br /><br />
"Option") to purchase [] shares of the Company's fully-paid and<br /><br />
non-assessable common stock, par value $.01 per share (the<br /><br />
"Shares") pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive<br /><br />
Plan, as amended and restated effective as of June 1, 1997 (the<br /><br />
"Plan") on or before [], 200[] (the "Expiration Date"), subject,<br /><br />
however, to the following terms and conditions:<br /><br />
1.<br /><br />
Exercise. The Option herein granted may be exercised<br /><br />
subject to the provisions of the Plan and Section 5 hereof, as to<br /><br />
the following amounts of the Shares:<br /><br />
[] Shares on or after []<br /><br />
As to an additional [] Shares on or after []<br /><br />
As to an additional [] Shares on or after []<br /><br />
by giving written notice of such exercise to the Company at any<br /><br />
time (or exercised as to part of each allotment, from time to<br /><br />
time), specifying the number of Shares to be purchased.<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
closing shall be held within ten days after receipt of notice of<br /><br />
exercise.<br /><br />
2.<br /><br />
Exercise Price. The aggregate purchase price of the<br /><br />
Shares to be purchased pursuant to any exercise of this Option<br /><br />
shall be equal to the product of the number of Shares to be<br /><br />
purchased<br /><br />
multiplied by the "Exercise Price", as<br /><br />
defined<br /><br />
hereinafter.<br /><br />
The Exercise Price for all Shares to be purchased<br /><br />
shall be $[] per Share.<br /><br />
3.<br /><br />
Adjustments on Recapitalization.<br /><br />
The number of<br /><br />
Shares subject hereto and the Exercise Price per Share shall be<br /><br />
proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease, after the<br /><br />
date hereof, in the number of issued Shares resulting from the<br /><br />
subdivision or consolidation of Shares, or the payment of a stock<br /><br />
dividend on the Shares or increase in the Shares outstanding<br /><br />
effected<br /><br />
without receipt of consideration by the Company,<br /><br />
provided that any Options to purchase fractional Shares resulting<br /><br />
from such adjustments shall be eliminated.<br /><br />
If the Company shall at any time merge or consolidate with<br /><br />
or into another corporation, Optionee (or other party entitled to<br /><br />
the Option) will thereafter receive, upon the exercise of the<br /><br />
Option, the securities or property to which a holder of the<br /><br />
number of Shares then deliverable upon the exercise of the Option<br /><br />
would have been entitled upon such merger or consolidation, and<br /><br />
the Company shall take such steps in connection with such merger<br /><br />
or consolidation as may be necessary to assure that provisions of<br /><br />
the Company's stock option plans shall thereafter be applicable,<br /><br />
as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or<br /><br />
property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Option.<br /><br />
A sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company<br /><br />
for a consideration (apart from the assumption of obligations)<br /><br />
constituted primarily of securities shall be deemed a merger or<br /><br />
consolidation for the foregoing purposes. In the event of the<br /><br />
proposed dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
Company, other than pursuant to a merger or consolidation as<br /><br />
hereinabove provided, the Option shall terminate as of a date to<br /><br />
be fixed by the Company's Compensation Advisory Committee;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
provided that not less than 120 days (or such shorter period as<br /><br />
shall elapse between the date the Board of Directors shall decide<br /><br />
upon a dissolution, liquidation or reorganization and<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
effective<br /><br />
date<br /><br />
of<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
dissolution,<br /><br />
liquidation<br /><br />
or<br /><br />
reorganization) prior written notice shall be given to Optionee<br /><br />
and Optionee shall have the right, during such period to exercise<br /><br />
this Option as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby,<br /><br />
including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be<br /><br />
exercisable.<br /><br />
4.<br /><br />
Adjustment upon Exercise. If Optionee exercises this<br /><br />
Option by payment of all or a portion of the Exercise Price with<br /><br />
Shares which Optionee has owned for at least six months, Optionee<br /><br />
will receive an Option to purchase a number of Shares equal to<br /><br />
the number of Shares used in payment of the Exercise Price of the<br /><br />
original Option.<br /><br />
5.<br /><br />
Closing.<br /><br />
At the closing, full payment of the<br /><br />
aggregate purchase price for the Shares purchased by the Optionee<br /><br />
shall be made to the Company by delivery to the Company of<br /><br />
consideration acceptable to the Company for such Shares and such<br /><br />
Shares will then be delivered to Optionee. No Shares shall be<br /><br />
issued until full payment therefor has been made, and Optionee<br /><br />
shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to<br /><br />
any Shares subject to this Option until a certificate for such<br /><br />
Shares shall have been issued. If the number of Shares purchased<br /><br />
at the closing shall not be all the Shares purchasable under this<br /><br />
Option, a new Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement with the same<br /><br />
terms<br /><br />
and<br /><br />
conditions as this Option, including,<br /><br />
without<br /><br />
limitation, the Expiration Date, shall be issued for the balance<br /><br />
remaining of the Shares purchasable hereunder.<br /><br />
Consideration<br /><br />
acceptable to the Company includes (i) cash (including<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
certified or official bank check) or the equivalent thereof<br /><br />
acceptable to the Company, (ii) the equivalent fair market value<br /><br />
of Shares, properly endorsed, (iii) the equivalent fair market<br /><br />
value of any other property acceptable to the Company, or (iv)<br /><br />
any combination of (i), (ii) and (iii).<br /><br />
6.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Expiration.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
The Option shall expire and become null and<br /><br />
void at 5:00 P.M. Lafayette, Louisiana time, on the Expiration<br /><br />
Date.<br /><br />
This Option shall not terminate upon the Optionee's<br /><br />
termination of employment with the Company for any reason other<br /><br />
than termination of such employment by the Company for "cause" or<br /><br />
termination of such employment by Optionee without "good reason".<br /><br />
For purposes of this Agreement, the term "cause" shall mean<br /><br />
Optionee's<br /><br />
(i) engagement in gross negligence or<br /><br />
willful<br /><br />
misconduct in the performance of his duties with respect to the<br /><br />
Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) conviction of a felony or<br /><br />
misdemeanor, (iii) refusal without proper legal reason to perform<br /><br />
his duties and responsibilities to the Company or any of its<br /><br />
affiliates or (iv) breach of any provision of a<br /><br />
written<br /><br />
employment agreement between Optionee and the Company; provided,<br /><br />
however, that if Optionee's employment with the Company is<br /><br />
subject to and governed by the terms of a written employment<br /><br />
contract as of the date of Optionee's termination of employment,<br /><br />
the term "cause" for purposes of this Agreement shall include<br /><br />
only those events or circumstances which, pursuant to the terms<br /><br />
of such employment agreement, enable the Company to terminate<br /><br />
Optionee's employment without liability to Optionee (whether in<br /><br />
the nature of breach of contract damages, liquidated damages,<br /><br />
punitive damages, compensatory damages or otherwise).<br /><br />
For<br /><br />
purposes of this Agreement, the term "good reason" shall mean (i)<br /><br />
the removal of Optionee as Vice Chairman of the Company, (ii) a<br /><br />
reduction in Optionee's annual base salary by more than 10%<br /><br />
unless such reduction was pursuant to a Company-wide cost<br /><br />
reduction program pursuant to which all Company employees were<br /><br />
treated substantially equally, (iii) a breach by the Company of<br /><br />
any obligation owed to Optionee under any written agreement<br /><br />
between Optionee and the Company with respect to Optionee's<br /><br />
employment with, or benefit from, the Company or any of its<br /><br />
affiliates or (iv) death or total disability of Optionee.<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any provision in this Option to<br /><br />
the contrary, this Option shall become immediately exercisable in<br /><br />
whole or in part, at the election of Optionee, upon the<br /><br />
occurrence of an event which constitutes a change in control of<br /><br />
XCL, provided that under no circumstances shall an option be<br /><br />
exercisable within six months (or such greater or lesser period<br /><br />
<br /><br />
prescribed or permitted by any applicable rule promulgated under<br /><br />
the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 16b-3 from<br /><br />
its grant date. For purposes of this Paragraph (b), a "change in<br /><br />
control of XCL" shall mean a change in control of a nature that<br /><br />
would be required to be reported in response to Item 5(f) of<br /><br />
Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities<br /><br />
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); provided<br /><br />
that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be<br /><br />
deemed to have occurred if (Y) any "person" (as such term is used<br /><br />
in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than XCL<br /><br />
or any person who on the date the Plan is amended is a director<br /><br />
or officer of XCL is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as<br /><br />
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or<br /><br />
indirectly, of securities of XCL representing 20% or more of the<br /><br />
combined voting power of XCL's then outstanding securities,<br /><br />
unless such person owns, directly or indirectly, as of the date<br /><br />
the Plan is amended, more than 25% of the combined voting power<br /><br />
of XCL's then outstanding securities, in which case, if any such<br /><br />
person (a "Major Stockholder") becomes the beneficial owner,<br /><br />
directly or indirectly, of 33a% or more of the combined voting<br /><br />
power of XCL's then outstanding securities; provided, further,<br /><br />
however, that acquisition of 33a% or more of such combined voting<br /><br />
power shall not constitute a "change in control of XCL" if (1)<br /><br />
such combined voting power does not exceed 372% or more of the<br /><br />
combined voting power of XCL's then outstanding securities, and<br /><br />
(2) either (i) to the extent any such increase in a Major<br /><br />
Stockholder's beneficial ownership results from a redemption or<br /><br />
purchase by XCL of its securities, or (ii) if the Board of<br /><br />
Directors of XCL, by vote of two-thirds (b) of the full Board, in<br /><br />
good<br /><br />
faith,<br /><br />
determines (hereinafter<br /><br />
referred<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
as<br /><br />
a<br /><br />
"Determination") both (A) that such acquisition<br /><br />
does<br /><br />
not<br /><br />
constitute, in fact, a change in the control of XCL and (B) that<br /><br />
such Major Stockholder does not and cannot then control XCL or<br /><br />
(Z) during any period of two consecutive years prior to the date<br /><br />
of such Determination, individuals who at the beginning of such<br /><br />
period constituted the Board of Directors cease for any reason to<br /><br />
constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election of<br /><br />
each director who was not a director at the beginning of such<br /><br />
period has been approved in advance by directors representing at<br /><br />
least two-thirds of the directors then in office who were<br /><br />
directors at the beginning of the period.<br /><br />
7.<br /><br />
Transferability.<br /><br />
This Option<br /><br />
is<br /><br />
granted<br /><br />
in<br /><br />
recognition of the personal services of the Optionee to the<br /><br />
Company or its affiliates and is not assignable or transferable<br /><br />
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.<br /><br />
During the lifetime of the Optionee, this Option shall be<br /><br />
exercisable only by him.<br /><br />
8.<br /><br />
Subject to Plan. The Option granted hereunder has<br /><br />
been issued under the Plan and is specifically subject to and<br /><br />
conditioned upon approval by the stockholders of the Company of<br /><br />
the June 1, 1997 amendment and restatement of the Plan and shall<br /><br />
be null and void ab initio if such approval is not obtained. In<br /><br />
addition to the provisions hereof, this Option will be subject to<br /><br />
the power under the Plan of the Company's Compensation Advisory<br /><br />
Committee and the Board of Directors to make interpretations of<br /><br />
the Plan and of any options granted thereunder, and to make<br /><br />
determinations and take other actions with respect to the Plan;<br /><br />
provided,<br /><br />
however,<br /><br />
that<br /><br />
if<br /><br />
any<br /><br />
such<br /><br />
interpretations,<br /><br />
determinations or other actions shall conflict with any of the<br /><br />
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions shall<br /><br />
hereof<br /><br />
control; and provided further, that this Option shall not be<br /><br />
treated as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422A<br /><br />
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By acceptance<br /><br />
hereof, Optionee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and<br /><br />
recognizes and agrees that determinations, interpretations or<br /><br />
other actions respecting the Plan may be made by a majority of<br /><br />
the Board of Directors or by the Compensation Advisory Committee.<br /><br />
9.<br /><br />
Securities Laws. Optionee acknowledges that he has<br /><br />
been informed of, or is otherwise familiar with, the nature and<br /><br />
the limitations imposed by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended<br /><br />
(the<br /><br />
"Act"), the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations<br /><br />
thereunder (in particular, Rule 144, promulgated under the Act<br /><br />
and Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and Rule 16b-3 promulgated<br /><br />
thereunder), concerning the Shares issuable upon exercise of this<br /><br />
Option and agrees to be bound by the restrictions embodied in the<br /><br />
Act,<br /><br />
the Exchange Act and all the rules and regulations<br /><br />
promulgated thereunder.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.<br /><br />
Reservation of Shares. The Company will at all<br /><br />
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized Shares,<br /><br />
the required number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of this<br /><br />
Option.<br /><br />
11.<br /><br />
Optionee not a Stockholder. Optionee shall not be<br /><br />
entitled by reason of this Option to any rights whatsoever as a<br /><br />
stockholder of the Company.<br /><br />
12.<br /><br />
The<br /><br />
Company's Right to Terminate Employment.<br /><br />
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Optionee<br /><br />
the right to employment by the Company or any of its affiliates.<br /><br />
13.<br /><br />
Withholding. Optionee hereby agrees that he will<br /><br />

costs shall be eligible for in accordance with the<br /><br />
provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 18, below. In the event<br /><br />
that CNPC elects to participate at a level less than fiftyone percent (51%) of the participating interest, or not to<br /><br />
participate in the development of the Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field, the Contractor shall pay the remaining development<br /><br />
costs necessary for the development of the Oil Field and/or<br /><br />
Gas Field in accordance with Article 12.1.2 hereof.<br /><br />
2.6 If any Oil Field and/or Gas Field is developed<br /><br />
within the Contract Area, the Petroleum produced therefrom<br /><br />

Article 4<br /><br />
Contract Term<br /><br />
4.1 The term of the Contract shall include an<br /><br />
appraisal period, a development period and a production<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
4.2 The appraisal period, beginning on the Date of<br /><br />
Commencement of the Implementation of the Contract, shall be<br /><br />
divided into three (3) phases and shall consist of five (5)<br /><br />
consecutive Contract Years, unless the Contract is sooner<br /><br />
terminated, or the appraisal period is extended in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 25 hereof and/or Article 4.3 herein.<br /><br />
The three (3) phases shall be as follows:<br /><br />
The first phase of one (1) Contract Year (the<br /><br />
first Contract Year);<br /><br />
The second phase of two (2) Contract Years (the<br /><br />
second Contract Year through the third Contract<br /><br />
Year); and<br /><br />
The third phase of two (2) Contract Years (the<br /><br />
fourth Contract Year through the fifth Contract<br /><br />
Year).<br /><br />
4.3 Where time is insufficient to complete the<br /><br />
appraisal work on a Petroleum discovery prior to the<br /><br />
expiration of the appraisal period or where the time of the<br /><br />
appraisal work on a Petroleum discovery in accordance with<br /><br />
the appraisal Work Program approved by JMC as stated in<br /><br />
Articles 11 and 18 hereof extends beyond the appraisal<br /><br />
period, the appraisal period as described in Article 4.2<br /><br />
herein shall be extended. The period of extension shall be<br /><br />
<br /><br />
whatever period CNPC regards as a reasonable period of time<br /><br />
required to complete the above mentioned appraisal work in<br /><br />
order to enable JMC to make a decision on the commerciality<br /><br />
of the said Petroleum discovery in accordance with Article<br /><br />
11 or 18 hereof, and until the Department or Unit approves<br /><br />
or finally rejects the Overall Development Program.<br /><br />
4.4 The development of any Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
within the Contract Area shall begin on the date of approval<br /><br />
by the Department or Unit of the Overall Development Program<br /><br />
of the said Oil Field and/or Gas Field, and end on the date<br /><br />
of the entire completion of the Development Operations set<br /><br />
forth in the Overall Development Program, excluding the time<br /><br />
for carrying out additional development projects in the<br /><br />
production period in accordance with Article 11.9 hereof.<br /><br />
The Contractor and CNPC will commence preparation of the<br /><br />
Overall Development Program when appraisal of any potential<br /><br />
Oil Field and/or Gas Field indicates by reinterpretation of<br /><br />
seismic and mapping and integrated reservoir study that such<br /><br />
field is commercial. The Overall Development Program will be<br /><br />
submitted for approval by the Department or Unit as soon as<br /><br />
approved by the JMC.<br /><br />
4.5 The production period of any Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area shall be a period of twenty<br /><br />
(20) consecutive Production Years beginning on the Date of<br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production unless otherwise<br /><br />

hereof. Under such circumstances as where the overall<br /><br />
development of an Oil Field and/or Gas Field is to be<br /><br />
conducted on a large scale, and the time span required<br /><br />
therefor is long, or where separate production of each of<br /><br />
the multiple oil or gas producing zones of an Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field is required, or under other special<br /><br />
circumstances, the production period thereof shall, when it<br /><br />
is necessary, be appropriately extended with the approval<br /><br />
of the Department or Unit.<br /><br />
4.6 Suspension Or Abandonment Of Production Of An Oil<br /><br />
Field and/or Gas Field.<br /><br />
4.6.1 In the event that the Parties agree to suspend<br /><br />
temporarily production from an Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
which has entered into commercial production, the Production<br /><br />
Area covered by that Oil Field and/or Gas Field may be<br /><br />
retained within the Contract Area. In no event shall the<br /><br />
period of such retention extend beyond the date of the<br /><br />
expiration of the production period of that Oil Field and/or<br /><br />
Gas Field except as otherwise provided in Article 25.4<br /><br />
hereof. The duration of the relevant period of production<br /><br />
suspension and the arrangement for the maintenance<br /><br />
operations during the aforesaid period of suspension shall<br /><br />
be proposed by the Operator, and shall be decided by JMC<br /><br />
through discussion. With respect to the aforesaid Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field which has been suspended and retained<br /><br />
within the Contract Area, in the event that production is<br /><br />
restored during the period of such retention, the production<br /><br />
period of that Oil Field and/or Gas Field shall be extended<br /><br />
correspondingly. In the event that the Parties fail to<br /><br />
reach an agreement on the restoration of production by the<br /><br />
expiration of the production suspension period decided by<br /><br />
JMC through discussion, the party who wishes to restore<br /><br />
production shall have the right to restore production<br /><br />
solely. The other party may later elect to participate in<br /><br />
production but shall have no rights or obligations in<br /><br />
respect of such Field for the solely restored production<br /><br />
period.<br /><br />
4.6.2 Abandonment Of Production From An Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field Within The Production Period.<br /><br />
4.6.2.1 During the production period, either party to<br /><br />
the Contract may propose the abandonment of production from<br /><br />
any Oil and/or Gas Field within the Contract Area, provided,<br /><br />
however, that prior written notice shall be given to the<br /><br />
other party to the Contract. The other party shall make a<br /><br />
response in writing within ninety (90) days from the date on<br /><br />
which the said notice is received. If the other party also<br /><br />
agrees to abandon production from the said Oil Field and/or<br /><br />
Gas Field, then abandonment costs shall be paid by the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Parties in proportion to their participating interests in<br /><br />
the development of such Oil Field and/or Gas Field. From<br /><br />
the date on which the other party makes the response in<br /><br />
writing, the production period of such Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field shall be terminated and such Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
4.6.2.2 If the Contractor notifies CNPC in writing of<br /><br />
its decision on abandoning production from an Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field, and CNPC decides not to abandon production<br /><br />
from such Oil Field and/or Gas Field, then from the date on<br /><br />
which the Contractor receives CNPC's written response of its<br /><br />
aforesaid decision, all of the Contractor's rights and<br /><br />
obligations, including but not limited to the<br /><br />
responsibilities for payment of abandonment in respect of<br /><br />
such Field, shall be terminated automatically, provided that<br /><br />
the Contractor shall not transfer to CNPC any of the<br /><br />
Contractor's liabilities and obligations in respect of the<br /><br />
said Field. The said Field shall be excluded from the<br /><br />
Contract Area.<br /><br />
4.7 The term of the Contract shall not go beyond<br /><br />

minimum of three (3) of the existing wells.<br /><br />
(d) spend a minimum of six million ($6,000,000) U.S.<br /><br />
dollars as its expected minimum appraisal expenditures for<br /><br />
such Appraisal Operations.<br /><br />
(e) Formulate the Overall Development Program if<br /><br />
appraisal of any potential Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
indicates that such a field is commercial.<br /><br />
6.2.3 During the third phase of the appraisal period,<br /><br />
the Contractor shall:<br /><br />
(a) drill two (2) Appraisal Wells with the footage of<br /><br />
three thousand (3,000) meters each; and<br /><br />
(b) spend a minimum of six million ($6,000,000) U.S.<br /><br />
dollars as its expected minimum appraisal expenditures for<br /><br />
such Appraisal Operations.<br /><br />
6.2.4 With respect to the minimum appraisal work<br /><br />
commitment for each phase of the appraisal period committed<br /><br />
by the Contractor in accordance with Articles 6.2.1, 6.2.2.<br /><br />
and 6.2.3 herein when calculating whether the minimum<br /><br />
appraisal work commitment has been fulfilled, the number of<br /><br />
Appraisal Wells and the kilometers of seismic lines<br /><br />
reprocessed and reinterpreted shall be the basis of such<br /><br />
calculation. However, the Appraisal Wells abandoned for<br /><br />
technical reasons without reaching their predetermined<br /><br />
geological objective shall not count as Appraisal Wells<br /><br />
actually fulfilled by the Contractor thereunder, without the<br /><br />
consent of CNPC.<br /><br />
6.3<br /><br />
At the expiration of the first phase or the<br /><br />
second phase of the appraisal period, the Contractor has the<br /><br />
following options:<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to enter the next phase and continue appraisal; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
to terminate the Contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6.4<br /><br />
At the expiration of any phase of the appraisal<br /><br />
period, if the actual appraisal work fulfilled by the<br /><br />
Contractor is less than the minimum appraisal work<br /><br />
commitment set forth for the said appraisal phase and if the<br /><br />
Contractor elects to enter the next phase and continue<br /><br />
appraisal under Article 6.3 (a) herein, the Contractor shall<br /><br />
give reasons to CNPC for the underfulfillment, and with the<br /><br />
consent of CNPC, the unfulfilled balance of the said phase<br /><br />
shall be added to the minimum appraisal work commitment for<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the next appraisal phase.<br /><br />
In the event of a commercial appraisal at any time<br /><br />
within the appraisal period, JMC shall, at the request of<br /><br />
any party to the Contract, discuss the possibility of<br /><br />
increasing the appraisal work. Any Appraisal Wells involved<br /><br />
in such increase shall be deducted from the minimum<br /><br />
appraisal work commitment.<br /><br />
6.5 Where the Contractor has fulfilled ahead of time<br /><br />
the minimum appraisal work commitment for any phase of the<br /><br />
appraisal period, the duration of such appraisal phase<br /><br />
stipulated in Article 4.2 hereof shall not be shortened<br /><br />
thereby, and if the appraisal work actually fulfilled by<br /><br />
the Contractor exceeds the minimum appraisal work commitment<br /><br />
for the said appraisal phase, the excess part shall be<br /><br />
deducted from and credited against the minimum appraisal<br /><br />
work commitment for the next appraisal phase.<br /><br />
6.6<br /><br />
If any addition or deduction is made under<br /><br />
Article 6.4 or Article 6.5 herein in regard to the minimum<br /><br />
appraisal work commitment for any phase of appraisal period,<br /><br />
the increased or reduced appraisal work shall become the new<br /><br />
minimum appraisal work commitment for the Contractor to<br /><br />
fulfill in the said phase.<br /><br />
6.7<br /><br />
At the expiration of any phase during the<br /><br />
appraisal period, if the appraisal work actually fulfilled<br /><br />
by the Contractor is less than the minimum appraisal work<br /><br />
commitment for such phase or less than the new minimum<br /><br />
appraisal work commitment as mentioned in Article 6.6<br /><br />
herein, and if, regardless of whether the expected minimum<br /><br />
appraisal expenditures are fulfilled or not fulfilled, the<br /><br />
Contractor elects to terminate the Contract under Article<br /><br />
6.3 (b) herein or if the said phase is the last phase of the<br /><br />
appraisal period, the Contractor shall, within thirty (30)<br /><br />
days from the date of the decision of election to terminate<br /><br />
the Contract or thirty (30) days from the date of the<br /><br />
expiration of the exploration period, pay CNPC any<br /><br />
unfulfilled balance of the minimum appraisal work commitment<br /><br />
(or of the new one) in U.S. dollars after it has been<br /><br />
converted into a cash equivalent using the method provided<br /><br />
in Annex II-Accounting Procedure attached hereto. However,<br /><br />
if the minimum appraisal work commitment for the appraisal<br /><br />
period is fulfilled while its expected corresponding minimum<br /><br />
appraisal expenditures are not fulfilled, the unfulfilled<br /><br />
part shall be deemed as a saving and shall not be paid to<br /><br />
CNPC.<br /><br />

CNPC requests any modifications on the aforesaid annual Work<br /><br />
Program and budget, the Parties shall promptly hold meetings<br /><br />
to make modifications and any modifications agreed upon by<br /><br />
the Parties shall be effected immediately. In case CNPC<br /><br />
fails to notify JMC of its approval within fifteen (15)<br /><br />
days, the annual Work Program and budget proposed by the<br /><br />
Operator shall be deemed to have been approved by CNPC. The<br /><br />
Operator shall make its best efforts to perform the<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in accordance with the approved or<br /><br />
modified annual Work Program and budget.<br /><br />
10.1.2<br /><br />
The Operator shall submit a preliminary<br /><br />
appraisal Work Program and budget to the JMC prior to<br /><br />
commencement of the drilling of an Appraisal Well.<br /><br />
10.1.3<br /><br />
If the JMC approves the preliminary<br /><br />
appraisal Work Program and budget thereof, they will submit<br /><br />
the preliminary appraisal Work Program and budget thereof to<br /><br />
CNPC for review and approval. Within fifteen (15) days<br /><br />
following the receipt of the preliminary appraisal Work<br /><br />
Program and budget thereof, CNPC shall notify JMC in writing<br /><br />
of its approval or any modifications thereto with its<br /><br />
detailed reasons. If CNPC requests any modifications on the<br /><br />
aforesaid preliminary appraisal Work Program and budget<br /><br />
thereof, the Parties shall promptly hold meetings to discuss<br /><br />
modifications and any modifications agreed upon by the<br /><br />
Parties shall be effected immediately. In case CNPC fails<br /><br />
to notify JMC of its approval or disapproval within fifteen<br /><br />
(15) days following the receipt of the preliminary appraisal<br /><br />
Work Program, the preliminary appraisal Work Program and<br /><br />
budget thereof proposed by the Operator shall be deemed to<br /><br />
have been approved by CNPC. The Operator shall make its<br /><br />
best efforts to perform the Appraisal Operations in<br /><br />
accordance with the approved or modified preliminary<br /><br />
appraisal Work Program and budget thereof.<br /><br />
10.1.4<br /><br />
CNPC and JMC acknowledge that the<br /><br />
preliminary appraisal Work Program may need modifications as<br /><br />
the Operator drills Appraisal Wells. The Operator will<br /><br />
immediately notify CNPC if modifications to the plan<br /><br />
outlined in the preliminary Work Program appear to be<br /><br />
necessary along with detailed reasons. In case CNPC fails<br /><br />
to notify Operator of its approval or disapproval of the<br /><br />
modifications within one hundred twenty (120) hours, the<br /><br />
modifications shall be deemed to have been approved by CNPC.<br /><br />
The modifications to be made shall, in no case, reduce the<br /><br />
minimum appraisal work commitment stipulated in Article 6.2<br /><br />
hereof.<br /><br />
10.2 The Operator may, in accordance with the<br /><br />
following provisions, incur excess expenditures or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
expenditures outside the budget in carrying out the Work<br /><br />
Program and budget, provided that the objectives in the<br /><br />
approved Work Program and budget are not changed:<br /><br />
10.2.1 In carrying out an approved budget for a<br /><br />
single item, such as the drilling of a well, the Operator<br /><br />
may, if necessary, incur excess expenditures of no more than<br /><br />
ten percent (10%) of the budgeted amount. The Operator<br /><br />
shall report quarterly the aggregate amount of all such<br /><br />
excess expenditures to JMC for confirmation.<br /><br />
10.2.2 For the efficient performance of the Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations, the Operator may, without approval, undertake<br /><br />
certain individual projects which are not included in the<br /><br />
Work Program and budget, for a maximum expenditure of One<br /><br />
Hundred Thousand U.S. dollars (U.S. $100,000), but the<br /><br />
Operator shall, within ten (10) days after such expenditures<br /><br />
are incurred, report to JMC for confirmation. In case of<br /><br />
emergency, the Operator may incur emergency expenditures for<br /><br />
the amount actually needed but shall report such<br /><br />
expenditures to JMC as soon as they are made. However, the<br /><br />
said emergency expenditures shall not be subject to Articles<br /><br />
10.2.3 and 10.2.4 herein.<br /><br />
10.2.3 In the event that the aggregate of excess<br /><br />
expenditures under Article 10.2.1 herein and expenditures<br /><br />
under Article 10.2.2 herein incurred in a Calendar Year<br /><br />
cause the total expenditures of that Calendar Year to exceed<br /><br />
the approved annual budget, such excess shall not exceed<br /><br />
five percent (5%) of the approved annual budget for that<br /><br />
Calendar Year. If the aforesaid excess is expected to be in<br /><br />
excess of five percent (5%) of the annual budget, the<br /><br />
Operator shall present its reasons therefor to JMC and<br /><br />
obtain its approval for incurring such expenditures.<br /><br />
10.2.4 When JMC confirms the excess expenditures<br /><br />
mentioned in Article 10.2.1 herein, and the expenditures<br /><br />
mentioned in Article 10.2.2 herein;<br /><br />
(a) If expenditures or excess expenditures are<br /><br />
determined to be reasonable, the Operator may incur such<br /><br />
expenditures or excess expenditures again during the same<br /><br />
Calendar Year, subject to Article 10.2 herein; or<br /><br />
(b) If expenditures or excess expenditures are<br /><br />
determined to be unreasonable, the Operator shall not<br /><br />
such expenditures or excess expenditures again during<br /><br />
same Calendar Year and such unreasonable expenditures<br /><br />
excess expenditures shall be dealt with in accordance<br /><br />
Article 5.4 of Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
incur<br /><br />
the<br /><br />
or<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Article 11<br /><br />
Determination of Commerciality<br /><br />
11.1<br /><br />
The preliminary appraisal Work Program in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 10.1.2 will consist of the minimum<br /><br />
Work Program as stipulated in Article 6.2.<br /><br />
11.2<br /><br />
After the approval by the JMC of the<br /><br />
preliminary appraisal Work Program referred to in Article<br /><br />
10.1.3 hereof, the Operator shall carry out the operations<br /><br />
as soon as possible without unreasonable delay in accordance<br /><br />
with the timetable set forth in the approved preliminary<br /><br />
appraisal Work Program referred to in Article 11.1 herein.<br /><br />
11.3 Within one hundred and eighty (180) days after<br /><br />
the completion of the last Appraisal Well, the Operator<br /><br />
shall submit to JMC a detailed report on the appraisal of<br /><br />
the commerciality of the discovered Petroleum-bearing trap.<br /><br />
Under special circumstances, the above-mentioned periods may<br /><br />
be reasonably extended upon agreement of the Parties.<br /><br />
The appraisal report shall include an evaluation of<br /><br />
geology, development, engineering and economics and the<br /><br />
Overall Development Program to be approved. The Overall<br /><br />
Development Program shall include the Maximum Efficient Rate<br /><br />
(MER) determined in accordance with international Petroleum<br /><br />
industry practice.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.4 Within thirty (30) days following the submission<br /><br />
of the appraisal report on any Crude Oil bearing trap, JMC<br /><br />
shall convene a meeting to review such report. When JMC<br /><br />
decides unanimously after its review that the said Crude Oil<br /><br />
bearing trap is an Oil Field with commercial value and is to<br /><br />
be developed, or the Contractor considers, in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 11.6.2 herein, that a Crude Oil bearing trap is<br /><br />
an Oil Field with commercial value and decides it is to be<br /><br />
developed, JMC shall submit to CNPC for confirmation the<br /><br />
appraisal report and the Overall Development Program of the<br /><br />
said Oil Field to be developed and CNPC shall submit the<br /><br />
Overall Development Program of the Oil Field to the<br /><br />
Department or Unit as soon as possible for its review and<br /><br />
approval. The Operator shall perform the Development<br /><br />
Operations in accordance with the Overall Development<br /><br />
Program of each Oil Field approved by the Department or<br /><br />
Unit. If such Development Operations do not commence within<br /><br />
ninety (90) days after the date of approval of the Overall<br /><br />
Development Program of an Oil Field by the Department or<br /><br />
Unit, or if an intentional delay caused unilaterally by the<br /><br />
Contractor acting as the Operator results in a suspension or<br /><br />
a halt of ninety (90) continuous days in the Development<br /><br />
Operations of an Oil Field, the Contractor shall be deemed<br /><br />
to have automatically waived all its rights in the said Oil<br /><br />
Field.<br /><br />
11.5 If, after the appraisal, JMC determines that a<br /><br />
Crude Oil bearing trap is non-commercial, such Crude Oil<br /><br />
bearing trap may, at the Contractor's option, be retained<br /><br />
within the Contract Area during the term of the appraisal<br /><br />
period; before the expiration of the appraisal period, if,<br /><br />
because of certain positive factors, JMC considers<br /><br />
unanimously that it is necessary to reappraise the<br /><br />
commerciality of the Crude Oil bearing trap, the Operator<br /><br />
shall submit a further appraisal report on such Crude Oil<br /><br />
bearing trap to JMC for its review and adoption; if the<br /><br />
JMC's determination of non-commerciality of such Crude Oil<br /><br />
bearing trap has not altered by the expiration of the<br /><br />
appraisal period, the relevant area of such Crude Oil<br /><br />
bearing trap shall be excluded from the Contract Area.<br /><br />
11.6 If JMC can not reach an agreement on the<br /><br />
commerciality of a Crude Oil bearing trap, the Parties<br /><br />
shall make their best efforts to seek another solution<br /><br />
thereto. However, if JMC can not reach an agreement on the<br /><br />
commerciality of any Crude Oil bearing trap within ninety<br /><br />
(90) days following the submission of the appraisal report<br /><br />
prepared by the Operator in accordance with Article 11.3<br /><br />
herein or any further appraisal report prepared by the<br /><br />
Operator in accordance with Article 11.5 herein, then such<br /><br />
trap shall be dealt with in accordance with the following<br /><br />
procedure:<br /><br />
11.6.1 If the Contractor considers a Crude Oil bearing<br /><br />
trap without commercial value, then the Contractor shall be<br /><br />
deemed to have waived its rights to participate in the<br /><br />
development of that Crude Oil bearing trap. The relevant<br /><br />
area covered by that Crude Oil bearing trap shall, however,<br /><br />
be retained within the Contract Area until the expiration of<br /><br />
the appraisal period. In case that CNPC decides, within the<br /><br />
appraisal period, to develop solely and to pay the<br /><br />
development costs of such Oil Field, then, at any time<br /><br />
within the development period, the Contractor shall be<br /><br />
allowed to elect to participate in the development. If the<br /><br />
Contractor decides, within the development period of such<br /><br />
Oil Field, to participate in the development of such Oil<br /><br />
Field by giving a written notice to CNPC, then, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall pay CNPC an amount of money, in addition to<br /><br />
the forty-nine percent (49%) of the development costs spent<br /><br />
by CNPC on the said Oil Field with Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
up to the date of the Contractor's submission of the written<br /><br />
notice to CNPC. Such amount shall be equal to three times<br /><br />
(300%) the foregoing development costs paid by CNPC with<br /><br />
Deemed Interest thereon and such amount of money shall not<br /><br />
be recovered by the Contractor after commercial production<br /><br />
of the Oil Field commences. Thereafter, the development<br /><br />
costs to be incurred in such Oil Field shall be provided by<br /><br />
the Parties in proportion to their respective participating<br /><br />
interests. In the event that the Contractor still decides<br /><br />
<br /><br />
not to participate in the development of the said Oil Field<br /><br />
by the expiration of the development period of such Oil<br /><br />
Field, then the said Oil Field shall be excluded from the<br /><br />
Contract Area upon the Date of Commencement of Commercial<br /><br />
Production of the said Oil Field.<br /><br />
11.6.2 If CNPC considers a Crude Oil bearing trap to<br /><br />
have no commercial value while the Contractor considers that<br /><br />
it is a Crude Oil bearing trap having commercial value, the<br /><br />
Contractor may solely provide the entire development costs<br /><br />
and undertake development of the said Oil Field, and the<br /><br />
said Oil Field shall be deemed as an Oil Field in which CNPC<br /><br />
has no participating interests. The entire risk related to<br /><br />
the development costs spent for the said Oil Field shall be<br /><br />
borne solely by the Contractor.<br /><br />
11.6.3 Unless otherwise decided by CNPC, the<br /><br />
Development Operations and Production Operations of an Oil<br /><br />
Field solely financed by CNPC shall still be, upon agreement<br /><br />
between the Parties through consultation, performed by the<br /><br />
Operator subject to agreement on terms and conditions<br /><br />
entered into by CNPC and the Operator.<br /><br />
11.7 In the event of an Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
Straddling a Boundary, CNPC shall arrange for the Contractor<br /><br />
and the neighboring parties involved to work out a unitized<br /><br />
Overall Development Program for such Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field and to negotiate the relevant provisions thereof.<br /><br />
11.8 If a Petroleum-bearing trap without commercial<br /><br />
value within the Contract Area can be more economically<br /><br />
developed as a commercial Oil Field by linking it up with<br /><br />
facilities located outside the Contract Area, the<br /><br />
development of such Oil Field shall be dealt with in the<br /><br />
same manner as provided in Article 11.7 herein.<br /><br />
11.9 The procedures specified in this Article 11 shall<br /><br />
be applied, by analogy, to determination of additional<br /><br />
development projects in any Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
within the Contract Area during the production period, such<br /><br />
projects being designed to increase the level of production<br /><br />
and/or total quantity of Petroleum recoverable from the said<br /><br />
Field.<br /><br />
11.10<br /><br />
It is anticipated that Trial Production will<br /><br />
be conducted in connection with Appraisal Operations. If<br /><br />
Trial Production is to be conducted in any Oil Field and/or<br /><br />
Gas Field within the Contract Area, the Parties shall agree<br /><br />
to the procedure of such Trial Production.<br /><br />
Article 12<br /><br />
Financing and Cost Recovery<br /><br />
12.1 Funds required for the Petroleum Operations shall<br /><br />
be raised by the Operator in accordance with Work Programs<br /><br />
and budgets determined pursuant to the relevant provisions<br /><br />
of the Contract, the provisions described in Annex IIAccounting Procedure hereto, and the provisions described<br /><br />
herebelow.<br /><br />
12.1.1 All of the appraisal costs required for<br /><br />
Appraisal Operations shall be provided by the Contractor,<br /><br />
with the exception of the previous costs incurred by Dagang<br /><br />
which are calculated to be nineteen million three hundred<br /><br />
twelve thousand ($19,312,000) U.S. dollars (hereinafter<br /><br />
referred to as Dagang's "Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs").<br /><br />
However, the appraisal costs required for the fulfillment of<br /><br />
the minimum appraisal work commitment shall be deemed the<br /><br />
equity capital of the Contractor.<br /><br />
12.1.2<br /><br />
With the exception of the previous<br /><br />
development costs incurred by Dagang, which are calculated<br /><br />
to be eleven million six hundred eighty one thousand<br /><br />
($11,681,000) U.S. dollars (hereinafter referred to as<br /><br />
Dagang's "Pre-Contract Development Costs"), which are to be<br /><br />
borne solely by Dagang, the development costs required for<br /><br />
Development Operations in each Oil Field and/or Gas Field<br /><br />
within the Contract Area shall be provided by CNPC and the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor in proportion to their respective participating<br /><br />
interests: fifty-one percent (51%) by CNPC and forty-nine<br /><br />
percent (49%) by the Contractor, unless CNPC applies<br /><br />
provisions in the second paragraph of this Article 12.1.2<br /><br />
herein.<br /><br />
In the event that CNPC, at its option, decides not to<br /><br />
participate in the development of an Oil Field and/or Gas<br /><br />
Field, or decides to participate in the development to an<br /><br />
extent less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the<br /><br />
participating interest, CNPC shall notify the Contractor in<br /><br />
writing of its decision to not participate or to participate<br /><br />
at a specific percentage which is less than fifty-one (51%)<br /><br />
participating interest before the appraisal report is to be<br /><br />
reviewed by JMC pursuant to Article 11.4 or Article 18.2.2<br /><br />
hereof. In such case, if CNPC does not participate in the<br /><br />
development of such Field, the development costs therein<br /><br />
shall be borne solely by the Contractor, or in the event<br /><br />
CNPC participates in the development of such Field to an<br /><br />
extent of less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the<br /><br />
participating interests, such development costs shall be<br /><br />
borne by the Parties in proportion to their actual<br /><br />
respective participating interests.<br /><br />
12.1.3 The operating costs incurred for the<br /><br />
performance of the Production Operations of each Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field before the Date of Commencement of<br /><br />
Commercial Production shall be considered as development<br /><br />
costs. The operating costs so incurred after the Date of<br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production shall be paid<br /><br />
respectively by CNPC and the Contractor in proportion to<br /><br />
their participating interests of the development costs of<br /><br />
the said Field.<br /><br />
12.1.4 For the purpose of implementation of the<br /><br />
Contract, CNPC shall agree that the Contractor may, when<br /><br />
financing, use the entitlement of its share of production<br /><br />
under the Contract as a security for loans, provided that<br /><br />
the Contractor shall apply to CNPC in advance and the<br /><br />
application therefor shall be examined by CNPC, and provided<br /><br />
further that the right and interests of CNPC under the<br /><br />
Contract shall not be impaired thereby.<br /><br />
12.2 All the costs incurred in the performance of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations shall be recovered in accordance with<br /><br />
Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto and the provisions<br /><br />
described as follows:<br /><br />
12.2.1 The operating costs for any given Calendar Year<br /><br />
actually incurred by CNPC and the Contractor in respect of<br /><br />
each Oil Field pursuant to Article 12.1.3 herein shall be<br /><br />
recovered in kind by the Parties out of the Crude Oil<br /><br />
produced from the said Oil Field during that Calendar Year<br /><br />
in accordance with Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto,<br /><br />
after the operating costs have been converted into a<br /><br />
quantity of Crude Oil on the basis of the Crude Oil price<br /><br />
determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
Unrecovered operating costs shall be carried forward to the<br /><br />
succeeding Calendar Year.<br /><br />
12.2.2<br /><br />
The appraisal costs incurred by the Parties<br /><br />
shall be recovered as follows:<br /><br />
After the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production<br /><br />
of an Oil Field within the Contract Area, the appraisal<br /><br />
costs incurred by the Parties in respect of the Contract<br /><br />
Area shall be recovered in kind out of the Crude Oil<br /><br />
produced from any Oil Field within the Contract Area in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 13.2.2 hereof, after the appraisal<br /><br />
costs have been converted into a quantity of Crude Oil based<br /><br />
on the Crude Oil price determined in accordance with Article<br /><br />
14 hereof. The appraisal costs shall be recovered without<br /><br />
interest.<br /><br />
If no Oil Field and/or Gas Field is developed within<br /><br />
the Contract Area, the appraisal costs incurred by the<br /><br />
Parties shall be deemed as their loss. Under no<br /><br />
circumstances shall CNPC or Contractor be required to<br /><br />
reimburse the Parties for such loss.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2.3 The development costs in respect of each Oil<br /><br />
Field incurred by CNPC and the Contractor and Deemed<br /><br />
Interest thereon for each Oil Field shall be recovered as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
12.2.3.1 After the Date of Commencement of Commercial<br /><br />
Production of any Oil Field within the Contract Area, the<br /><br />
development costs in respect of such Field incurred by CNPC<br /><br />
and the Contractor and Deemed Interest thereon calculated in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 12.2.3.2 herein shall be recovered<br /><br />
in kind out of the Crude Oil produced from such Field in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 13.2.2.2 hereof, after the<br /><br />
development costs have been converted into a quantity of<br /><br />
Crude Oil based on the Crude Oil price determined in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
12.2.3.2 Deemed Interest on the development costs<br /><br />
incurred by CNPC and the Contractor for each Oil Field<br /><br />
and/or Gas Field within the Contract Area shall be<br /><br />
calculated with the fixed annual compound rate of nine<br /><br />
percent (9%) from the first day of the month following the<br /><br />
month in which such development costs expended by each party<br /><br />
to the Contract are actually received in the bank account of<br /><br />
the Joint Account opened by the Operator. Dagang's PreContract Development Costs will earn Deemed Interest at the<br /><br />
fixed annual compound rate of nine percent (9%), commencing<br /><br />
from the date that the Overall Development Program for the<br /><br />
Oil Field and/or Gas Field has received all necessary<br /><br />
approvals.<br /><br />
The detailed method of such calculation shall<br /><br />
be as provided in Annex II-Accounting Procedure hereto.<br /><br />
12.2.4 The amount of Crude Oil up to a quantity of<br /><br />
sixty thousand (60,000) metric tons extracted and delivered<br /><br />
from an Oil Field before the Date of Commencement of<br /><br />
Commercial Production shall be allocated in accordance with<br /><br />
Article 13 hereof.<br /><br />
12.3 The provisions in Article 12.2 herein shall<br /><br />
apply, by analogy, to Gas Fields.<br /><br />
Article 13<br /><br />
Crude Oil Production and Allocation<br /><br />
13.1 The Operator shall, in accordance with the<br /><br />
production profile, adjusted as the case may be, set forth<br /><br />
in the Overall Development Program for each Oil Field as<br /><br />
approved by the Department or Unit, work out a Crude Oil<br /><br />
production plan for each Oil Field in each Calendar Year and<br /><br />
carry out Crude Oil production pursuant to such plan.<br /><br />
13.2 The Annual Gross Production of Crude Oil of each<br /><br />
Oil Field within the Contract Area in each Calendar Year<br /><br />
within the production period shall be allocated in<br /><br />
accordance with the following sequence and proportions.<br /><br />
13.2.1 The percentages of the Annual Gross Production<br /><br />
of Crude Oil specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder<br /><br />
shall be used for payments of the Value-Added Tax and<br /><br />
royalty, respectively, and shall be paid in kind to the<br /><br />
relevant authorities of the Chinese Government through CNPC.<br /><br />
(a) Value Added Tax shall be paid in accordance with<br /><br />
relevant regulations of the People's Republic of China; and<br /><br />
(b) Royalty shall be paid in accordance with relevant<br /><br />
regulations of the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />
13.2.2 Sixty percent (60%) of the Annual Gross<br /><br />
Production of Crude Oil shall be deemed as the "cost<br /><br />
recovery oil" and shall be used for payments for cost<br /><br />
recovery in the following sequence:<br /><br />
13.2.2.1 Payment in kind for the operating costs<br /><br />
actually incurred but not yet recovered by the Parties<br /><br />
pursuant to Article 12.2.1 hereof after the price of the<br /><br />
said "cost recovery oil" has been determined in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 14 hereof.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.2.2.2 The remainder of the "cost recovery oil"<br /><br />
shall, after payment for operating costs in accordance with<br /><br />
Article 13.2.2.1 herein, be deemed as "investment recovery<br /><br />
oil". Such "investment recovery oil" shall be used for the<br /><br />
recovery of the appraisal costs in respect of the Contract<br /><br />
Area which were incurred and not yet recovered by the<br /><br />
Parties, and shall be used for the recovery of the<br /><br />
development costs in respect of the Oil Field itself which<br /><br />
were incurred and not yet recovered by CNPC and the<br /><br />
Contractor in accordance with Articles 12.2.2 and 12.2.3<br /><br />
hereof, and Deemed Interest thereon. The method of recovery<br /><br />
and the recovery sequence are as follows:<br /><br />
(a) Beginning in the Calendar Year during which the<br /><br />
production of any Oil Field within the Contract Area<br /><br />
commences, the "investment recovery oil" referred to in<br /><br />
Article 13.2.2.2 herein, based on the price which has been<br /><br />
determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof shall be<br /><br />
paid in kind first to the Parties for the recovery of the<br /><br />
appraisal costs thereon which were incurred in respect of,<br /><br />
and have not yet been recovered from, the Contract Area.<br /><br />
Such "investment recovery oil" for any Calendar Year shall<br /><br />
be shared by the Parties for the recovery of the unrecovered<br /><br />
appraisal costs on the following basis:<br /><br />
(1) "Investment recovery oil" shall be allocated 49% to<br /><br />
recover Contractor's appraisal costs and 51% to recover<br /><br />
Dagang's Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs.<br /><br />
(2) If, at the end of the appraisal period, the<br /><br />
Contractor's appraisal costs do not exceed eighteen million,<br /><br />
five hundred fifty-five thousand ($18,555,000) U.S. dollars,<br /><br />
then the portion of Dagang's Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs<br /><br />
that will not be recovered proportionate with Contractor's<br /><br />
appraisal costs (hereinafter referred to as Dagang's<br /><br />
"Remaining Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs") shall be carried<br /><br />
forward to be recovered as at the same time as development<br /><br />
costs are recovered on the first Oil field to attain<br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production, as provided in<br /><br />
Article 13.2.2.2 (b)(1),below. Remaining Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Appraisal costs shall accrue Deemed Interest beginning on<br /><br />
the first day of the Contract Year following the end of the<br /><br />
appraisal period described in Article 4.2.<br /><br />
(3) If Contractor's appraisal costs exceed eighteen<br /><br />
million, five hundred fifty-five thousand ($18,555,000) U.S.<br /><br />
dollars, then, after Dagang has fully recovered all of its<br /><br />
Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs, Contractor's remaining<br /><br />
appraisal costs shall be recovered from 100% of "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil", as an incentive to Contractor's appraisal<br /><br />
efforts.<br /><br />
The unrecovered appraisal costs shall be carried forward to<br /><br />
succeeding Calendar Years until fully recovered.<br /><br />
(b)(1) In the case of the first Oil Field to attain<br /><br />
Commencement of Commercial Production, beginning in the<br /><br />
Calendar Year during which the appraisal costs incurred by<br /><br />
the Parties in respect of the Contract Area have been fully<br /><br />
recovered, the remainder of the "investment recovery oil" of<br /><br />
such Oil Field shall be used for the simultaneous recovery<br /><br />
of (1) the development costs incurred and not yet recovered<br /><br />
respectively by CNPC and the Contractor and Deemed Interest<br /><br />
thereon in respect of such Field, (2) Dagang's Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Development Costs and Deemed Interest thereon calculated in<br /><br />
accordance with Article 12.2.3.2, above, and (3) Dagang's<br /><br />
Remaining Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs without Deemed<br /><br />
Interest on the following basis:<br /><br />
I. Until Dagang has fully recovered its Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Development Costs together with Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
together with its Remaining Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs<br /><br />
together with Deemed Interest thereon, such "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil" shall be shared on the following basis after<br /><br />
the price of such remainder of the "investment recovery oil"<br /><br />
has been determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof:<br /><br />
(1) the Contractor's share of such "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil" shall be based on the ratio of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(A) Contractor's share of the budgeted costs<br /><br />
to develop the Oil Field, as set forth in the approved<br /><br />
Overall Development Program<br /><br />
to<br /><br />
(B) (1)CNPC's share of the budgeted costs to<br /><br />
develop the Oil Field, as set forth in the approved Overall<br /><br />
Development Program, plus (2) Dagang's Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Development Costs, plus (3) Dagang's Remaining Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Appraisal Costs;<br /><br />
(2) the balance of "investment recovery oil"<br /><br />
shall be allocated to CNPC and Dagang. The unrecovered<br /><br />
development costs and Deemed Interest thereon, unrecovered<br /><br />
Pre-Contract Development Costs and Deemed Interest thereon,<br /><br />
and unrecovered Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs and Deemed<br /><br />
Interest thereon shall be carried forward to succeeding<br /><br />
Calendar Years until fully recovered.<br /><br />
II. After Dagang has fully recovered its Pre-Contract<br /><br />
Development Costs together with Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
together with its Remaining Pre-Contract Appraisal Costs<br /><br />
together with Deemed Interest thereon, such "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil" for any Calendar Year shall be used for the<br /><br />
simultaneous recovery of the development costs incurred and<br /><br />
not yet recovered respectively by CNPC and the Contractor<br /><br />
and Deemed Interest thereon is respect of such Field in<br /><br />
proportion to their respective participating interests<br /><br />
therein after the price of such remainder of the "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil" has been determined in accordance with Article<br /><br />
14 hereof. The unrecovered development costs and Deemed<br /><br />
Interest thereon shall be carried forward to succeeding<br /><br />
Calendar Years until fully recovered.<br /><br />
(b)(2) In the case of each Oil Field other than the<br /><br />
first Oil Field to attain commencement of Commercial<br /><br />
Production, beginning in the Calendar Year during which the<br /><br />
appraisal exploration costs incurred by the Parties in<br /><br />
respect of the Contract Area have been fully recovered, the<br /><br />
remainder of the "investment recovery oil" of such an Oil<br /><br />
Field shall be used for the simultaneous recovery of the<br /><br />
development costs incurred and not yet recovered<br /><br />
respectively by CNPC and the Contractor and Deemed Interest<br /><br />
thereon in respect of such Field in proportion to their<br /><br />
respective participating interests therein after the price<br /><br />
of such remainder of the "investment recovery oil" has been<br /><br />
determined in accordance with Article 14 hereof. The<br /><br />
unrecovered development costs and Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
shall be carried forward to succeeding Calendar Years until<br /><br />
fully recovered.<br /><br />
(c) During the production period of an Oil Field,<br /><br />
costs for an additional development project incurred<br /><br />
pursuant to Article 11.9 hereof and Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
shall be recovered together with the unrecovered development<br /><br />
costs and Deemed Interest thereon. If the development costs<br /><br />
and Deemed Interest thereon have been fully recovered, then<br /><br />
costs for the said additional development project and Deemed<br /><br />
Interest thereon shall be recovered from the "investment<br /><br />
recovery oil" of such Field referred to in Article 13.2.2.2<br /><br />
herein in accordance with the provisions specified in<br /><br />
Article 13.2 herein. The unrecovered costs for the<br /><br />
additional development project and Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
shall be carried forward to succeeding Calendar Years until<br /><br />
fully recovered.<br /><br />
(d) After the recovery of an Oil Field's development<br /><br />
costs and Deemed Interest thereon and/or costs for the<br /><br />
additional development project and Deemed Interest thereon<br /><br />
from the said Field by the Parties, the remainder of the<br /><br />
"investment recovery oil" shall automatically be regarded as<br /><br />
part of the "remainder oil" referred to in Article 13.2.3<br /><br />
herein. By the date of expiration of the production period<br /><br />
of an Oil Field pursuant to Article 4.5 hereof, if any<br /><br />
development costs and Deemed Interest thereon and/or costs<br /><br />
for the additional development project incurred in respect<br /><br />
of such Field and Deemed Interest thereon have not yet been<br /><br />
fully recovered, then such unrecovered costs and Deemed<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Interest thereon shall be regarded as a loss, and the<br /><br />
Parties shall bear the loss in proportion to their<br /><br />
respective participating interests. Any unrecovered PreContract Appraisal Costs and Deemed Interest thereon or PreContract Development Costs and Deemed Interest thereon shall<br /><br />
be regarded as a loss and be borne by Dagang.<br /><br />
13.2.3 The remainder of the Annual Gross Production of<br /><br />
Crude Oil after the allocation referred to in Articles<br /><br />
13.2.1 and 13.2.2 shall be deemed as "remainder oil". Such<br /><br />
"remainder oil" shall be divided into "share oil" of the<br /><br />
Chinese side and "allocable remainder oil". The "allocable<br /><br />
remainder oil" of each Oil Field in each Calendar Year shall<br /><br />
be equal to the "remainder oil" of that Calendar Year<br /><br />
multiplied by the factor (x) for each Oil Field within the<br /><br />
Contract Area in that Calendar Year. The factor (X) of each<br /><br />
Oil Field in each Calendar Year shall be determined in<br /><br />
accordance with the following successive incremental tiers<br /><br />
on the basis of the Annual Gross Production of Crude Oil<br /><br />
from such Oil Field during that Calendar Year.<br /><br />

13.2.4 The "allocable remainder oil" of each Oil Field<br /><br />
in each Calendar Year referred to in Article 13.2.3 herein<br /><br />
shall be shared by the Parties in proportion to their<br /><br />
respective participating interests in the development costs,<br /><br />
fifty-one percent (51%) for CNPC and forty-nine percent<br /><br />
(49%) for the Contractor. In the event that CNPC does not<br /><br />
participate in the development of an Oil Field within the<br /><br />
Contract Area, the Contractor shall obtain one hundred<br /><br />
percent (100%) of the "allocable remainder oil" of that<br /><br />
Field. In the event that CNPC participates to an extent<br /><br />
less than fifty-one percent (51%) in the development of an<br /><br />
Oil Field within the Contract Area, the "allocable remainder<br /><br />
oil" of such Field in that Calendar Year shall be shared by<br /><br />
the Parties in proportion to their actual respective<br /><br />
participating interests in such Oil Field.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.3 Pursuant to the method of allocation specified in<br /><br />
this Article, the Contractor may obtain an aggregate amount<br /><br />
of Crude Oil consisting of the following three categories:<br /><br />
13.3.1 The total amount of Crude Oil as converted from<br /><br />
the actual operating costs paid by the Contractor in all Oil<br /><br />
Fields in proportion to its participating interests in the<br /><br />
development costs stipulated in 12.1.3 hereof when<br /><br />
recovering such costs;<br /><br />
13.3.2 The total amount of the "investment recovery<br /><br />
oil" from all Oil Fields due to the Contractor provided for<br /><br />
in Article 13.2.2.2 herein; and<br /><br />
13.3.3 The total amount of the "allocable remainder<br /><br />
oil" of all Oil Fields due to the Contractor in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 13.2.4 herein.<br /><br />
13.4 In the event that the Contractor wishes to<br /><br />
purchase a portion of or all of the total amount of the<br /><br />
Crude Oil obtained by CNPC from the "investment recovery<br /><br />
oil" in addition to the Crude Oil obtained by the Contractor<br /><br />
in accordance with Article 13.3 herein, the Parties shall<br /><br />
negotiate the terms and conditions of purchasing such Crude<br /><br />
Oil and reach an agreement as a supplementary document<br /><br />
hereto.<br /><br />
13.5 CNPC and each company comprising the Contractor<br /><br />
shall, throughout the entire Contract term, have the right<br /><br />
and obligation, in each Calendar Quarter to lift and take,<br /><br />
and separately dispose of their respective full shares of<br /><br />
all Crude Oil produced, and determined pursuant to Articles<br /><br />
13.3 and 13.4 herein.<br /><br />
In the event that the Crude Oil production of any Oil<br /><br />
Field is reduced because CNPC or any company comprising the<br /><br />
Contractor does not lift and take its full share of Crude<br /><br />
Oil or lifts nothing, then such reduction in Crude Oil<br /><br />
production shall not affect the full shares of Crude Oil due<br /><br />
to or the shares of Crude Oil available to be lifted and<br /><br />
disposed of by the other party as provided in Article 13.6<br /><br />
(c) herein.<br /><br />
13.6 A Crude Oil lifting procedure shall be agreed<br /><br />
upon by the Parties no later than six (6) months prior to<br /><br />
the Date of Commencement of Commercial Production within the<br /><br />
Contract Area, and shall include, but not be limited to:<br /><br />
(a) Operator's notification of Crude Oil production to<br /><br />
CNPC and the Contractor;<br /><br />
(b) Notification by CNPC and each company comprising<br /><br />
the Contractor of its expected offtake to the Operator;<br /><br />
(c) Operator's notification to CNPC and each company<br /><br />
comprising the Contractor of the final Crude Oil lifting<br /><br />
schedule which shall be binding on CNPC and each company<br /><br />
comprising the Contractor;<br /><br />
(d) Limitation and calculation of overlift and<br /><br />
underlift of CNPC and each company comprising the<br /><br />
Contractor; and provisions to ensure timely and ratable<br /><br />
lifting of Crude Oil;<br /><br />
(e) Determination of allowable operational tolerance<br /><br />
of liftings; and<br /><br />
(f) other terminal procedures as may be required to<br /><br />
reflect the particular circumstances.<br /><br />
13.7 For the purpose of implementing the procedures as<br /><br />
described in Article 13.6 herein, CNPC and each company<br /><br />
comprising the Contractor shall jointly set up a Crude Oil<br /><br />
lifting coordination group consisting of representatives<br /><br />
each appointed by CNPC and each company comprising the<br /><br />
Contractor, with the representative of CNPC as the chairman.<br /><br />
Such group shall be responsible for the preparation of Crude<br /><br />
Oil lifting plans of Calendar Year, of Calendar Quarter and<br /><br />
of calendar month and shall also be responsible for the<br /><br />
reasonable and unified arrangements and adjustments of the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
aforesaid Crude Oil lifting plans through close contact with<br /><br />
any operator in charge of the storage and loading<br /><br />
facilities.<br /><br />
Article 14<br /><br />
Quality, Quantity,<br /><br />
Price and Destination of Crude Oil<br /><br />
14.1 In accordance with Article 13.3 hereof, the<br /><br />
Contractor may obtain the aggregate amount of three (3)<br /><br />
categories of the Crude Oil referred to in Articles 13.3.1,<br /><br />
13.3.2 and 13.3.3 hereof. In addition the Contractor may<br /><br />
purchase a portion or all of the total amount of the Crude<br /><br />
Oil allocated to CNPC from the "investment recovery oil" in<br /><br />
all Oil Fields within the Contract Area in accordance with<br /><br />
Article 13.4 hereof.<br /><br />
14.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Quality of the Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.2.1 The quality analysis of the Crude Oil produced<br /><br />
from each Oil Field within the Contract Area shall be<br /><br />
undertaken at the Delivery Point. Such analysis shall be<br /><br />
carried out on a sample taken by the State Administration of<br /><br />
Import and Export Commodity Inspection (hereafter referred<br /><br />
to as the "Administration") or any representative agency<br /><br />
delegated by the Administration pursuant to standards issued<br /><br />
by the State Bureau of Standardization of the People's<br /><br />
Republic of China or by the Department or Unit.<br /><br />
14.2.2 The Crude Oil quality analysis referred to in<br /><br />
Article 14.2.1 above shall include the following:<br /><br />
(a) density at 20 degrees Centigrade, in grams per<br /><br />
cubic centimeter;<br /><br />
(b) sulfur content, in weight percentage;<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
water content, in weight percentage; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
basic sediment content, in weight percentage.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Quantity of the Crude Oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.3.1 The quantity measurement of the Crude Oil<br /><br />
produced from each Oil Field within the Contract Area, when<br /><br />
being lifted, shall be made at a Delivery Point and with<br /><br />
measuring devices both to be agreed upon by the Parties. A<br /><br />
relevant measuring organization of the Chinese Government or<br /><br />
a representative agency delegated thereby shall, at<br /><br />
appropriate regular intervals, calibrate all the measuring<br /><br />
devices, conduct special testing and issue certificates or<br /><br />
confirmation with respect thereto before the measuring<br /><br />
devices are put into use. The quality and quantity of the<br /><br />
Crude Oil delivered shall be authenticated in accordance<br /><br />
with the commodity quality certificate and weight<br /><br />
certificate issued by the Administration and such quality<br /><br />
and quantity shall be the basis for the accounting<br /><br />
settlement.<br /><br />
14.3.2 If any party to the Contract believes that the<br /><br />
Crude Oil measuring devices, sampling or analysis are<br /><br />
inaccurate, or has any objection to the results specified in<br /><br />
the above mentioned certificates, on-site investigations,<br /><br />
technical exchanges and discussions may be conducted by the<br /><br />
Parties to resolve the issue in a manner satisfactory to the<br /><br />
Parties.<br /><br />
14.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Determination of the Crude Oil Price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.4.1 The price of various grades of the Crude Oil<br /><br />
shall be expressed as FOB price at the Delivery Point.<br /><br />
Determination of the Crude Oil price shall be made with<br /><br />
reference to the prevailing price in arm's length<br /><br />
transactions of the long term contract sales of similar<br /><br />
quality crude oil on the main world oil markets and the<br /><br />
adjustments in such price shall be made in accordance with<br /><br />
such determinants as the quality of the Crude Oil, the terms<br /><br />
<br /><br />
of delivery, transportation, payment and other terms.<br /><br />
The aforesaid price in arm's length transactions in<br /><br />
this Article refers to a price at which a seller sells its<br /><br />
crude oil to a buyer who is independent of the seller, but<br /><br />
not including the prices used by them for government to<br /><br />
government transactions which do not reflect international<br /><br />
oil market price, crude oil exchange, barter or spot<br /><br />
transactions.<br /><br />
14.4.2 Where the Crude Oil produced from each Oil<br /><br />
Field within the Contract Area differs in grades, the prices<br /><br />
of such Crude Oil with different quality shall be<br /><br />
individually determined.<br /><br />
14.4.3 The price of the Crude Oil produced from all<br /><br />
the Oil Fields within the Contract Area shall be denominated<br /><br />
in U.S. dollars per metric ton. However, if an<br /><br />
international currency other than the U.S. dollar prevails<br /><br />
on the main world oil markets as the pricing unit of crude<br /><br />
oil, the Parties may also use that international currency<br /><br />
therefor upon mutual agreement.<br /><br />
14.4.4<br /><br />
Oil price.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Procedure for the Determination of the Crude<br /><br />
<br /><br />
14.4.4.1 The Crude Oil price shall be determined each<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter. In case the crude oil price prevailing on<br /><br />
most world oil markets fluctuates, CNPC and the Contractor<br /><br />
each shall have the right to propose, at any time, that a<br /><br />
new Crude Oil price be negotiated and determined.<br /><br />
14.4.4.2 The Contractor shall, no later than fortyfive (45) days prior to commencement of any Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter, notify CNPC of its proposed price for the Crude Oil<br /><br />
to be lifted in such Calendar Quarter (for the purpose of<br /><br />
this Article thereafter referred to as the said Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter).<br /><br />
14.4.4.3 CNPC shall notify the Contractor of its<br /><br />
decided price within ten (10) days after the receipt of the<br /><br />
aforesaid proposed price notified by the Contractor. In the<br /><br />
absence of a different price notified by CNPC to the<br /><br />
Contractor within ten (10) days after the receipt of the<br /><br />
aforesaid notification, the proposed price notified by the<br /><br />
Contractor as referred to in Article 14.4.4.2 herein shall<br /><br />
be applied to the Crude Oil to be lifted in the said<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter.<br /><br />
14.4.4.4 The Contractor shall, within five (5) days<br /><br />
following its receipt of notice of a price decided by CNPC,<br /><br />
state to CNPC whether the price is acceptable. If it is<br /><br />
acceptable, the said decided price shall be regarded as the<br /><br />
price agreed upon by the Parties for the said Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter. If not acceptable, the Parties shall, within ten<br /><br />
(10) days, carry out further negotiation in an amicable<br /><br />
manner to determine the price for the said Calendar Quarter.<br /><br />
14.4.4.5 In the event that the Parties still cannot<br /><br />
reach an agreement on the Crude Oil price for the said<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter through further negotiations by the<br /><br />
Parties, the Contractor may lift the Crude Oil in accordance<br /><br />
with the quota specified for the said Calendar Quarter in<br /><br />
Article 13.2 hereof, and the Crude Oil price for the<br /><br />
preceding Calendar Quarter shall apply provisionally to the<br /><br />
Crude Oil of such quota and/or the payment shall be made<br /><br />
accordingly. Then, the Parties shall negotiate further on<br /><br />
the Crude Oil price for the said Calendar Quarter taking<br /><br />
into account relevant independent and non-proprietary market<br /><br />
data on Third Party long-term-contract-sales of crude oil in<br /><br />
substantial quantities on the main world oil markets,<br /><br />
adjusted for quality, transportation and other applicable<br /><br />
differentials. The Parties shall each take into account the<br /><br />
information supplied and discussed and attempt to agree on a<br /><br />
Crude Oil price based upon such information by the end of<br /><br />
the said Calendar Quarter.<br /><br />
(A) In the event that the Parties still cannot reach<br /><br />
an agreement on the Crude Oil price by the end of the said<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter, then the Crude Oil price shall be the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
weighted average FOB price of the Crude Oil of the same or<br /><br />
similar quality sold by CNPC and/or the Contractor to a<br /><br />
Third Party or Third Parties and produced in the said<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter from the Oil Fields described hereafter,<br /><br />
adjusted for such differences as the quality, delivery,<br /><br />
transportation, payment and other terms, but excluding the<br /><br />
government to government transactions which do not reflect<br /><br />
international oil market price, crude oil exchange, barter<br /><br />
or spot transactions.<br /><br />
The application of the above-mentioned price of Crude<br /><br />
Oil sold to a Third Party or Third Parties shall be in the<br /><br />
following sequence:<br /><br />
(i) Firstly, the price, calculated and determined in<br /><br />
accordance with the above-mentioned stipulations, of the<br /><br />
Crude Oil produced from the relevant Oil Field or Oil Fields<br /><br />
in the Contract Area and sold to a Third Party or Third<br /><br />
Parties shall be applied;<br /><br />
(ii) In the event no sales as referred to in paragraph<br /><br />
(i) above were made in the said Calendar Quarter, the price,<br /><br />
calculated and determined in accordance with the abovementioned stipulations, of the Crude Oil produced from other<br /><br />
Oil Fields in the Contract Area and sold to a Third Party or<br /><br />
Third Parties shall be applied; and<br /><br />
(iii) In the event no sales mentioned in paragraphs<br /><br />
(i) and (ii) above were made in the said Calendar Quarter,<br /><br />
the price, calculated and determined in accordance with the<br /><br />
above-mentioned stipulations, of the Crude Oil produced from<br /><br />
the oil fields of other contract areas for Chinese-foreign<br /><br />
cooperative exploitation of petroleum resources and sold to<br /><br />
a Third Party or Third Parties shall be applied;<br /><br />
(B) In the event there are no such Third Party sales<br /><br />
of the Crude Oil during the said Calendar Quarter, then the<br /><br />
Crude Oil price for the said Calendar Quarter shall be equal<br /><br />
to the same Crude Oil price of the preceding Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter adjusted by the differences in the individual<br /><br />
arithmetic average of the daily weighted average of the<br /><br />
official government selling price of a basket of three or<br /><br />
more internationally traded Crude Oils in the said Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter compared with that of such basket of Crude Oils for<br /><br />
the preceding Calendar Quarter. The adjusted price shall be<br /><br />
the Crude Oil price for the said Calendar Quarter. The<br /><br />
Crude Oils selected for the basket shall each be similar in<br /><br />
quality to that from the Contract Area and chosen from<br /><br />
different countries and shall reflect the conditions of the<br /><br />
main world oil markets and shall be mutually agreed upon by<br /><br />
the Parties at a reasonable time prior to the Date of<br /><br />
Commencement of the Commercial Production of Crude Oil.<br /><br />
(C) If the Parties are unable to agree on a Crude Oil<br /><br />
Price for a Calendar Quarter in which Crude Oil is first<br /><br />
produced and delivered from or the production of Crude Oil<br /><br />
is restored in a Field in the Contract Area, then the Crude<br /><br />
Oil for the Calendar Quarter shall be priced and/or paid in<br /><br />
accordance with the arithmetic average price of the prices<br /><br />
finally proposed by the Parties in the Calendar Quarter.<br /><br />
Based on the Crude Oil price agreed upon by the Parties for<br /><br />
the succeeding Calendar Quarter, the Crude Oil price for the<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter shall be determined by adjusting<br /><br />
retroactively by the differences between the arithmetic<br /><br />
average prices of the basket of the Crude Oils for the<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter and the succeeding Calendar Quarter in<br /><br />
accordance with the calculation method referred to in<br /><br />
paragraph 14.4.4.5 (B) herein.<br /><br />
14.4.4.6 If, due to the delayed announcement of crude<br /><br />
oil prices by the main world oil-producing countries or the<br /><br />
main world oil markets, or if, as agreed by CNPC and the<br /><br />
Contractor, an unstable main world oil market exists, then<br /><br />
the period for the determination of the price referred to in<br /><br />
Article 14.4.4.2 herein may be extended to the end of the<br /><br />
said Calendar Quarter in question.<br /><br />
14.4.4.7 If the Crude Oil prices are adjusted<br /><br />
retroactively by the main world oil-producing countries,<br /><br />

Article 18<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
and Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
18.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.1.1 The Associated Natural Gas produced from any<br /><br />
Oil Field within the Contract Area shall be primarily used<br /><br />
for purposes related to the operations of production and<br /><br />
production enhancement of Oil Fields such as gas injection,<br /><br />
gas lifting and power generation.<br /><br />
18.1.2 Based on the principle of full utilization of<br /><br />
the Associated Natural Gas and with no impediment to normal<br /><br />
production of the Crude Oil, the Overall Development Program<br /><br />
of each Oil Field shall include a plan of utilization of the<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas. If there is any excess Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas in any Oil Field after utilization pursuant to<br /><br />
Article 18.1.1 herein (hereafter referred to as "excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas"), the Operator or the Contractor<br /><br />
shall carry out a feasibility study regarding the<br /><br />
utilization of such excess Associated Natural Gas of such<br /><br />
Oil Field. Such feasibility study, if carried out before<br /><br />
the Development Operations of an Oil Field, shall be<br /><br />
included as part of the feasibility study on the development<br /><br />
of the Oil Field. With respect to any Oil Field already<br /><br />
under commercial production, if a further feasibility study<br /><br />
on the utilization of its excess Associated Natural Gas is<br /><br />
required, such study shall be carried out by the Operator<br /><br />
and a report thereon shall be submitted to JMC for review<br /><br />
and discussion. If the Parties decide to utilize the excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of any Oil Field, the construction of<br /><br />
facilities for such utilization and the production of the<br /><br />
excess Associated Natural Gas shall be carried out at the<br /><br />
same time as the Oil Field construction and production.<br /><br />
18.1.2.1 If the Parties agree that the excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of an Oil Field has no commercial<br /><br />
value, then such gas shall be disposed of by the Operator,<br /><br />
provided that there is no impediment to normal production of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Crude Oil.<br /><br />
18.1.2.2 If any party to the Contract considers<br /><br />
unilaterally that the excess Associated Natural Gas of an<br /><br />
Oil Field has commercial value, such gas may be utilized by<br /><br />
that party to the Contract at its own expense without<br /><br />
affecting the amount of "cost recovery oil" and "allocable<br /><br />
remainder oil" due to the other party to the Contract which<br /><br />
does not invest in such utilization.<br /><br />
18.1.2.3 If the Parties agree that excess Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas of an Oil Field has commercial value, they shall<br /><br />
make further investment in its utilization in proportion to<br /><br />
their respective participating interests in the development<br /><br />
of the Oil Field. If the Parties disagree on the commercial<br /><br />
utilization of such excess Associated Natural Gas of that<br /><br />
Oil Field, they shall, guided by the principle of mutual<br /><br />
benefit, carry out further negotiations to find a new<br /><br />
solution to utilization of the said excess Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas and reach an agreement in writing. If the<br /><br />
Parties fail to reach an agreement through such<br /><br />
negotiations, CNPC shall reserve the right to dispose of<br /><br />
such excess Associated Natural Gas unilaterally.<br /><br />
18.1.3 Expenses incurred in the utilization of the<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of any Oil Field as stipulated in<br /><br />
Article 18.1.1 herein, and those incurred in carrying out a<br /><br />
feasibility study on the utilization of the excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas after commencement of commercial<br /><br />
production of the Oil Field referred to in Article 18.1.2<br /><br />
herein shall be charged to the development costs of the Oil<br /><br />
Field.<br /><br />
18.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non-associated Natural Gas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
18.2.1 When any Non-associated Natural Gas Field<br /><br />
(hereafter referred to as the "Gas Field") is discovered<br /><br />
within the Contract Area, the Parties shall carry out<br /><br />
friendly negotiations regarding the development and<br /><br />
production of the Gas Field with a view to reaching an<br /><br />
agreement of principle, which shall form a supplementary<br /><br />
document to the Contract, and shall include the following<br /><br />
principles:<br /><br />
18.2.1.1 The price of the Natural Gas produced from<br /><br />
the Contract Area shall be determined based on general<br /><br />
pricing principles prevailing internationally taking into<br /><br />
consideration such factors as the market, the grade, quality<br /><br />
and quantity of the Natural Gas, etc.;<br /><br />
18.2.1.2 The Contract term for the Gas Field within<br /><br />
the Contract Area shall be separately determined according<br /><br />
to the conditions for development, production of such Field<br /><br />
and marketing of the Natural Gas; and<br /><br />
18.2.1.3 The allocation of the Natural Gas shall be in<br /><br />
conformity with the general principles of allocation for the<br /><br />
Crude Oil stipulated in Article 13 hereof. However, the<br /><br />
percentages of the allocation shall be adjusted by the<br /><br />
Parties through negotiations in light of actual conditions<br /><br />
in the Gas Field so that the Contractor shall be able to<br /><br />
obtain a reasonable economic benefit.<br /><br />
Following the signature of the agreement of principle<br /><br />
herein, the Operator shall work out an evaluation Work<br /><br />
Program for the discovered Gas Field in accordance with the<br /><br />
terms and conditions in the said agreement of principle and<br /><br />
submit it to JMC for its review and approval. Upon approval<br /><br />
by JMC, the Operator shall carry out an evaluation Work<br /><br />
Program.<br /><br />
The expenses incurred by the Operator in carrying<br /><br />
out the said evaluation Work Program shall be charged to the<br /><br />
appraisal costs of the Contract Area.<br /><br />
18.2.2 After completion of evaluation of a Gas Field,<br /><br />
the Operator shall submit a report thereon to JMC for review<br /><br />
and discussion.<br /><br />
18.2.2.1 If JMC decides unanimously that a gas<br /><br />
reservoir is noncommercial, the corresponding area covered<br /><br />
by the gas reservoir may be retained in the Contract Area<br /><br />
<br /><br />
during the appraisal period. But if, at the expiration of<br /><br />
the appraisal period, JMC still considers the said gas<br /><br />
reservoir to be noncommercial, the area covered by the gas<br /><br />
reservoir shall be excluded from the Contract Area. For a<br /><br />
Gas Field which has potential commercial value but which has<br /><br />
not been developed due to a lack of market or a shortage of<br /><br />
consuming facilities, the period for which the Gas Field is<br /><br />
retained in the Contract Area may be extended at the request<br /><br />
of any party to the Contract. Such extended period,<br /><br />
however, shall not exceed three (3) consecutive Contract<br /><br />
Years after the date of expiration of the appraisal period<br /><br />
hereunder. In case the time needed for the market to<br /><br />
develop or for the consuming facilities to be constructed<br /><br />
for the Gas Field exceeds such extended period, a further<br /><br />
extended period shall be subject to the approval of the<br /><br />
relevant authorities of the Chinese Government.<br /><br />
Prior to the expiration of the appraisal period, if<br /><br />
JMC considers that a gas reservoir which has been determined<br /><br />
to be noncommercial needs to be reappraised because of some<br /><br />
favorable factors, the Operator shall work out a new<br /><br />
evaluation report on that gas reservoir and submit it to JMC<br /><br />
for review and approval.<br /><br />
18.2.2.2 If the Contractor considers any gas reservoir<br /><br />
to be non-commercial, the Contractor shall be deemed to have<br /><br />
waived its rights of participating in the development of<br /><br />
that gas reservoir.<br /><br />
18.2.2.3 Where the Parties consider a gas reservoir to<br /><br />
be commercial, the Parties shall negotiate to reach an<br /><br />
agreement on the development of the said gas reservoir,<br /><br />
based on the terms and conditions provided in the agreement<br /><br />
of principle referred to in Article 18.2.1 herein. The<br /><br />
agreement concerning the development shall be a<br /><br />
supplementary document and an integral part hereof. If the<br /><br />
Parties fail to reach such agreement through negotiations<br /><br />
within three (3) years after the date of commencement of<br /><br />
such negotiations, CNPC shall have the right unilaterally to<br /><br />
put up the gas reservoir for bidding. In such case, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall still be entitled to participate in the<br /><br />
bidding.<br /><br />
18.3 If CNPC utilizes unilaterally the excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas of an Oil Field or develops solely a<br /><br />
Gas Field and requires to apply thereto the Contractor's<br /><br />
appropriate and advanced technology and managerial<br /><br />
experience, the Parties shall negotiate terms and conditions<br /><br />
related thereto and the Operator shall carry out the<br /><br />
operations after an agreement has been reached on such terms<br /><br />
and conditions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
