If, at the end of the seventh (7th) Contract Year, a Discovery has been made but<br /><br />
there has been insufficient time for the Contractor (acting, and having acted, in<br /><br />
accordance with this Agreement) to appraise it, the obligation of the Contractor<br /><br />
under sub-Article 3.2 shall be postponed:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for such Sub-Blocks, and to such depths as the Designated Authority may<br /><br />
determine to be reasonably necessary to encompass the Field, plus a reserve<br /><br />
margin sufficient to cover the probable extent of the field;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
for such period as is reasonably necessary to permit the Contractor to<br /><br />
appraise (or to complete the Appraisal of) the Discovery; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
as a consequence of that Appraisal, for the Contractor to decide whether to<br /><br />
declare a Commercial Discovery and, if it does so, for the Designated<br /><br />
Authority to declare a Development Area in respect of it.<br /><br />

of:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
production from the Development Area ceasing permanently or for a<br /><br />
continuous period of twelve (12) months (or, if because of Force Majeure, as<br /><br />

Termination of Agreement and Continuing Obligations in respect of Relinquished<br /><br />
Area<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Agreement shall terminate in respect of a part of the Contract Area which is<br /><br />
relinquished.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Relinquishment of all or a part, of the Contract Area is without prejudice to the<br /><br />
obligations of the Contractor to Decommission.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Gas Retention Area<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Appraisal of a Discovery of Non-Associated Gas demonstrates that the<br /><br />
Discovery, although substantial, is not then, either alone or in combination with<br /><br />
other Discoveries, commercially viable, but is likely to become so within five<br /><br />
(5) years, the Designated Authority may, at the request of the Contractor, declare a<br /><br />
Gas Retention Area in respect of it for that period. On request of the Contractor, and<br /><br />
after demonstration that the grant of an extended period is likely to result in the<br /><br />
declaration of a Commercial Discovery, the Designated Authority may extend the<br /><br />
period of the Gas Retention Area for such longer period, and on such conditions, as<br /><br />
is considered appropriate by the Designated Authority.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Article 3 (but not sub-Article 3.3) applies to and in respect of a Gas Retention<br /><br />
Area as it does to and in respect of a Development Area for as long as, during that<br /><br />
period, the Contractor diligently seeks to make it commercially viable, and<br /><br />
demonstrates to the Designated Authority that it is doing so.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Gas Retention Area consists of those Sub-Blocks (forming a single contiguous<br /><br />
area) that encompass the Natural Gas Field, plus a reserve margin sufficient to cover<br /><br />
the probable and possible extent of it, but the Designated Authority may exclude<br /><br />
deeper formations in which no Discovery has been made. The Designated Authority,<br /><br />
at any time and from time to time, and whether of its own volition or at the request<br /><br />
of the Contractor, may:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
add Sub-Blocks then in the Contract Area to;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
remove Sub-Blocks from; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
vary by depth within the Contract Area,<br /><br />

Oil Retention Area<br /><br />
If the Appraisal of a Discovery of a Crude Oil Field demonstrates that the Discovery,<br /><br />
although substantial, is not then, either alone or in combination with other Discoveries,<br /><br />
commercially viable, but is likely to become so within five (5) years, the Designated<br /><br />
Authority may in its absolute discretion, at the request of the Contractor, declare an Oil<br /><br />
Retention Area in respect of it, or any part thereof, for that period on such terms and<br /><br />
conditions as the Designated Authority considers appropriate.<br /><br />

Performance of Exploration Work Programme and Budget<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If any well forming part of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget provided<br /><br />
for in this Article 4 is abandoned for any reason other than a reason specified in<br /><br />
paragraph 4.4 (b) before reaching the defined objectives of such well, the Contractor<br /><br />
shall drill a substitute well. In this event, the First, Second or Third Exploration<br /><br />
Period, as the case may be, shall be extended by a period of time equal in length to<br /><br />
the time spent in preparing for and drilling the substitute well, including mobilisation<br /><br />
and demobilisation of the drilling rig, if applicable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise agreed by the Designated Authority, any well which forms part of<br /><br />
the Exploration Work Programme and Budget provided for in this Article 4 shall be<br /><br />
drilled to such depth as is necessary for the evaluation of the geological formation<br /><br />
established by the available data as the target formation and which Good Oil Field<br /><br />
Practices would require the Contractor to attain, unless before reaching such depth:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
30 October 2006<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a formation stratigraphically older than the deepest target formation is<br /><br />
encountered;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
basement is encountered;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
further drilling would present an obvious danger, such as but not limited to<br /><br />
the presence of abnormal pressure or excessive losses of drilling mud;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
impenetrable formations are encountered;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Petroleum bearing formations are encountered which require protecting,<br /><br />
thereby preventing planned depths from being reached;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vi)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Contractor and the Designated Authority agree to terminate the drilling<br /><br />
operation; or<br /><br />
Page 19<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Designated Authority confirms that the drilling obligation has been<br /><br />
fulfilled.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In such circumstances the drilling of any such well may be terminated at a lesser<br /><br />
depth and shall be deemed to have satisfied the Contractor’s obligations in respect of<br /><br />
that well.<br /><br />

4.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Consequences of Non-Performance<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where a well which forms part of the Exploration Work Programme and Budget<br /><br />
provided for in this Article 4 results in a Discovery and the Contractor informs the<br /><br />
Designated Authority pursuant to sub-Article 4.9 that the Discovery merits<br /><br />
Appraisal, that well will be deemed to have met its objective and to have satisfied<br /><br />
the Contractor’s obligations in respect of that well.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If, in any Period, the Contractor carries out less Exploration than is required of it<br /><br />
under the Exploration Work Programme and Budget, the Designated Authority may:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
require that the shortfall be added to the Exploration to be carried out in the<br /><br />
next Period;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
require payment of the estimated cost of the Exploration not carried out in<br /><br />
that Period; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
terminate this Agreement and require payment of the estimated cost of the<br /><br />
Exploration not carried out in that Period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If, in a Period, the Contractor carries out more Exploration than is required of it, the<br /><br />
excess shall be credited against Exploration to be carried out in the following Period<br /><br />
and, to the extent in excess of that Exploration, shall be further carried forward.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Article 4, and of Article 6 and<br /><br />
Annex C and except with the consent of the Designated Authority, no work in a<br /><br />
Development Area will be regarded as Exploration except to the extent in respect of<br /><br />
a formation shallower or deeper than the Field concerned and in which no Discovery<br /><br />
has been made.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Work Programmes and Budgets<br /><br />
Subject to sub-Article 4.7, the Contractor shall carry out Petroleum Operations substantially<br /><br />
in accordance with Work Programmes and Budgets approved by the Designated Authority.<br /><br />
Such an approval by the Designated Authority is without prejudice to any other obligation or<br /><br />
liability of the Contractor under this Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Emergency and Other Expenditures Outside Work Programmes and Budgets<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Without further approval by the Designated Authority, the Contractor may<br /><br />
overexpend, by ten percent (10%) on any line item in an approved Work Programme<br /><br />
and Budget for a Period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Without further approval by the Designated Authority, the total of all overexpenditures under paragraph 4.7(a) under that Work Programme and Budget for<br /><br />
<br /><br />
30 October 2006<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 20<br /><br />
<br /><br />
that Period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total expenditures in that Work<br /><br />
Programme and Budget.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall promptly inform the Designated Authority if it anticipates (or<br /><br />
should reasonably anticipate) that any such limit in paragraph 4.7(b) will be<br /><br />
exceeded and seek, in the manner provided in this Article 4, an amendment to the<br /><br />
appropriate Work Programme and Budget.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In determining whether to approve the over-expenditures contemplated at paragraphs<br /><br />
4.7(a) and (b), the Designated Authority shall consider whether such increases are<br /><br />
necessary to complete the programme of works, provided that such increase is not<br /><br />
the result of any failure of the Contractor to fulfill its obligations under this<br /><br />
Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Nothing in sub-Article 4.6 or paragraph 4.7(a) precludes or excuses the Contractor<br /><br />
from taking all necessary and proper measures for the protection of life, health, the<br /><br />
environment and property if there is an emergency (including a significant fire,<br /><br />
explosion, Petroleum release, or sabotage; incident involving loss of life, serious<br /><br />
injury to an employee, contractor or third party, or serious property damage; strikes<br /><br />
and riots; or evacuation of the Operator's personnel). As soon as reasonably<br /><br />
practicable, the Operator will inform the Designated Authority of the details of the<br /><br />
emergency and of the actions it has taken and intends to take.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Exploration<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall submit, for the approval of the Designated Authority, an<br /><br />
Exploration Work Programme and Budget for each Period.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From time to time, the Contractor may submit, for the approval of the Designated<br /><br />
Authority, amendments to the Exploration Work Programme and Budget.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor is not obliged to carry out more Exploration in a Period than is<br /><br />
required by sub-Articles 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Discovery and Appraisal<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall notify the Designated Authority of a Discovery and shall<br /><br />
provide the Designated Authority with such information in respect of it as the Code<br /><br />
requires.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
As soon as reasonably practicable after a Discovery is made, the Contractor shall<br /><br />
advise the Designated Authority whether or not, having regard to paragraph 4.9(e),<br /><br />
the Discovery merits Appraisal.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
At such time and in such manner as the Designated Authority requires, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall submit, for the approval of the Designated Authority, an Appraisal<br /><br />
Work Programme and Budget for each Calendar Year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From time to time, the Contractor may submit, for the approval of the Designated<br /><br />
Authority, amendments to the Appraisal Work Programme and Budget.<br /><br />

4.10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
An Appraisal Work Programme and Budget for a Calendar Year will be such as<br /><br />
would be undertaken by a person seeking diligently to appraise (in accordance with<br /><br />
this Agreement) a Discovery with a view to determining if it is, either alone or in<br /><br />
combination with other Discoveries, a Commercial Discovery.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Commercial Discovery<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor may, at any time and having regard to paragraph 4.10(b), declare that<br /><br />
a Commercial Discovery has been made.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The declaration is to be made in such manner, and be accompanied by such<br /><br />
supporting data and information, as the Designated Authority requires, including the<br /><br />
Contractor's proposal as to that part of the Contract Area to be declared a<br /><br />
Development Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Designated Authority shall declare those Sub-Blocks which encompass the Field<br /><br />
in which the Commercial Discovery has been made plus a reserve margin sufficient<br /><br />
to cover the probable extent of the Field, to be a Development Area, but may<br /><br />
exclude deeper formations in which no Discovery has been made. The Designated<br /><br />
Authority, at any time and from time to time, of its own volition or that of the<br /><br />
Contractor, may:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
add Sub-Blocks then in the Contract Area to;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
remove Sub-Blocks from; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
vary by depth within the Contract Area,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
a Development Area as may be required to ensure that it encompasses the Field<br /><br />
concerned, but not, unless the Designated Authority and the Contractor otherwise<br /><br />
agree, after the first Development Plan in respect of the Development Area has been<br /><br />
approved. The Contractor shall relinquish any part of the Contract Area removed<br /><br />
from a Development Area as a consequence of such removal or other variation, if it<br /><br />
occurs after the time for the relinquishment provided for in paragraph 3.2(a).<br /><br />
4.11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Development Plan<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Not more than twelve (12) months after the declaration of a Development Area, and<br /><br />
in the manner required by the Designated Authority, the Contractor shall submit, for<br /><br />
the approval of the Designated Authority, a Development Plan for the Development<br /><br />
Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
From time to time, the Contractor may submit, for the approval of the Designated<br /><br />
Authority, amendments to the Development Plan.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
A Development Plan will be assessed on the basis of whether it would be undertaken<br /><br />
by a person seeking diligently to develop and exploit (in accordance with this<br /><br />
Agreement) the Petroleum in the Development Area in accordance with Good Oil<br /><br />
Field Practice and in a way that promotes further investment and contributes to the<br /><br />
long term development of Timor-Leste and Australia.<br /><br />

Authority for its approval at such times as are reasonable having regard to the<br /><br />
likelihood that the Decommissioning Plan (including cost estimates thereunder) may<br /><br />
need to be revised.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall carry out the Decommissioning Plan substantially in<br /><br />
accordance with its terms.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Estimates of the monies required for the funding of the Decommissioning Plan shall<br /><br />
be charged as Recoverable Costs beginning in the Calendar Year following the<br /><br />
Calendar Year in which Commercial Production first occurs. The amount charged in<br /><br />
each Calendar Year shall be calculated as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
30 October 2006<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The total Decommissioning costs at the expected date of Decommissioning<br /><br />
shall first be calculated.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
There shall be deducted from such total Decommissioning costs the additions<br /><br />
made to the Decommissioning Costs Reserve made, and taken as<br /><br />
Recoverable Costs, in all previous Calendar Years together with interest on<br /><br />
such Recoverable Costs calculated to the approved date of Decommissioning<br /><br />
at the actual or forecast rate of Uplift (whichever is applicable).<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The residual Decommissioning costs, resulting from the calculations under<br /><br />
sub-paragraph 4.14(d)(i) and (ii), shall then be discounted to the Calendar<br /><br />
Year in question at the forecast rate of Uplift for each Calendar Year<br /><br />
remaining until the Calendar Year of Decommissioning.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The discounted total of residual Decommissioning costs shall then be divided<br /><br />
by the total number of Calendar Years remaining prior to the Calendar Year<br /><br />
of Decommissioning itself, including the Calendar Year in question.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The resultant amount shall be the addition to the Decommissioning Costs<br /><br />
Reserve for the Calendar Year in question.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Page 25<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.15<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vi)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is the intention of this provision that the total accumulated provision<br /><br />
allowed, including interest calculated to the Calendar Year of<br /><br />
Decommissioning at the rate of Uplift, will equal the total Decommissioning<br /><br />
costs.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the amount in sub-paragraph 4.14(d)(v) is a negative amount, then such<br /><br />
amount shall be treated as a reduction of Recoverable Costs for the Calendar<br /><br />
Year in question.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Decommissioning Security<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Prior to Decommissioning, Security pursuant to the Decommissioning Security<br /><br />
Agreement shall be provided by the Contractor in an amount equal to the sum of<br /><br />
provisions made to the Decommissioning Costs Reserve, and taken as Recoverable<br /><br />
Costs, in all previous years together with interest on such Recoverable Costs<br /><br />
calculated to the end of the previous Calendar Year at the actual rate of Uplift.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
After Decommissioning commences, the Designated Authority shall at the end of<br /><br />
each Calendar Year review the amount of Security required for the outstanding<br /><br />
Decommissioning and shall take into consideration any Decommissioning costs that<br /><br />
have already been incurred.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(c)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Failure of the Contractor to provide Security and otherwise to fulfill its obligations<br /><br />
under the Decommissioning Security Agreement, shall be a breach of this<br /><br />
Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

Authority may not so elect other than:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
in respect of all, or the same percentage of all, of the Designated Authority’s<br /><br />
shares of Crude Oil for and throughout each Calendar Year, on not less than<br /><br />
ninety (90) days prior written notice to the Contractor before the start of the<br /><br />

for the separate lifting of their shares of Petroleum.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Title and Risk<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Petroleum shall be at the risk of the Contractor until it is delivered at the Field<br /><br />
Export Point. Without prejudice to any obligation or liability of the Contractor as a<br /><br />
consequence of a failure of the Contractor to comply with its obligations under the<br /><br />
Code and this Agreement (including sub-Article 5.1), Petroleum which is lost after it<br /><br />
is recovered at the well-head, and before it is delivered at the Field Export Point,<br /><br />
shall be deducted from the Contractor's Recoverable Costs under sub-Article 6.2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(b)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Title in the Contractor’s share of Petroleum shall pass to it when (and risk therein<br /><br />

Payment on Account<br /><br />
(a)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless the Designated Authority has made an election under paragraph 7.2(b), the<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The method for the allocation of general and administration costs, other than direct<br /><br />
charges, allocable to Petroleum Operations proposed by the Contractor shall be<br /><br />
subject to approval by the Designated Authority, and shall be applied each Calendar<br /><br />
Year consistently.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(d)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Inventory levels shall be in accordance with Good Oil Field Practice. The value of<br /><br />
inventory items not used in Petroleum Operations, or sold, the cost of which has<br /><br />
been recovered as an Operating Cost, shall be treated as Miscellaneous Receipts. The<br /><br />
cost of an item purchased for inventory shall be a Recoverable Cost.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(e)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where the cost of anything, or a receipt (or value) in respect of anything, relates only<br /><br />
partially to the carrying out of Petroleum Operations, only that portion of the cost or<br /><br />
the receipt (or value) which relates to the carrying out of Petroleum Operations will<br /><br />
be a Recoverable Cost or assessed as a Miscellaneous Receipt. Where any cost or<br /><br />
related receipt (or value) relates to more than one of Exploration, Appraisal, Capital<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The Contractor's locally recruited employees based in Timor-Leste or Australia:<br /><br />
Costs of all locally recruited employees who are directly engaged in the conduct of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations in the JPDA, Timor-Leste or Australia. Such costs shall<br /><br />
include the costs of employee benefits and state benefits for employees and levies<br /><br />
imposed on the Contractor as an employer, transportation and relocation costs within<br /><br />
Timor-Leste and Australia of the employee and such members of the employee's<br /><br />
family (limited to spouse and dependent children) as required by law or customary<br /><br />
practice therein. If such employees are also engaged in other activities, the cost of<br /><br />
such employees shall be apportioned on a time sheet basis according to sound and<br /><br />
acceptable accounting principles.<br /><br />

result in a net charge to the accounts under this Agreement consistent with<br /><br />
the value of the service rendered.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Premium prices – whenever material is not readily obtainable at published or<br /><br />
listed prices because of national emergencies, strikes or other unusual causes<br /><br />
over which the Contractor has no control, the Contractor may charge<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations for the required material at the Contractor's actual cost<br /><br />
incurred in providing such material, in making it suitable for use, and in<br /><br />
moving it to the Contract Area; provided notice in writing is furnished to the<br /><br />
Designated Authority of the proposed charge prior to charging Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations for such material and the Designated Authority shall have the<br /><br />
right to challenge the transaction on audit.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

executed through a Bidding process, which will be monitored by a Tender Committee, which<br /><br />

outside of Timor-Leste.<br /><br />
Action Plan: To seek and select 7 to 10 goods and services providers through the relevant<br /><br />
government authorities or advertisement. As such whenever the operator calls for a tender,<br /><br />
then the potential goods and services providers would be chosen from the initial list of<br /><br />
