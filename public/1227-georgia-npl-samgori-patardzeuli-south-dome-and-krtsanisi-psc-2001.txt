<br /><br />
The Minimum Work Programme shall consist of:<br /><br />
8.2.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within 12 months of the Effective Date, Contractor will<br /><br />
undertake to shoot and process seismic at a cost of $1.25<br /><br />
million which may be up to 200 km of new data.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.2.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Within 12 months of the Effective Date, the Contractor will<br /><br />

the Contractor may, within 18 Months of the Effective Date, present to<br /><br />
the Coordination Committee an Exploration or Appraisal Programme,<br /><br />
which, if necessary, may provide for the drilling of an exploration or<br /><br />
appraisal well, the depth of such will be defined by the seismic data<br /><br />
as determined by Contractor, and shall commence such Exploration or<br /><br />
Appraisal Programme, as approved by the Coordination Committee, within<br /><br />
24 Months of the Effective Date.<br /><br />
8.4 If the Contractor fails to present such an Exploration<br /><br />
or Appraisal Programme because the Contractor has determined that<br /><br />
the seismic surveys have not defined one or more structures with<br /><br />
sufficient commercial potential to justify at least an exploration<br /><br />
or appraisal well of the type described above, then Georgian Oil and<br /><br />
the Contractor shall discuss in good faith on how to proceed. If no<br /><br />
agreement is reached concerning a mutually acceptable Exploration<br /><br />
Programme then all the areas outside the Development Areas shall be<br /><br />
relinquished within three (3) years<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If an exploration well is drilled as aforesaid and the Contractor<br /><br />
concludes therefrom that there are significant quantities of Petroleum<br /><br />
which may result in a Commercial Discovery and gives a notice under<br /><br />
Article 9.1, then the provisions of Article 9.2 shall apply.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Upon completion of an Exploration or Appraisal Programme which has<br /><br />
resulted in the drilling of a well, the Contractor, at its option,<br /><br />
shall have the right to continue an Exploration Programme in the<br /><br />
Contract Area for two (2) years. If as a result of this additional<br /><br />
Exploration Programme, the Contractor believes therefrom that there are<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
34<br /><br />
not sufficient quantities of Petroleum to lead to a Commercial<br /><br />
Discovery, then Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall discuss in good<br /><br />
faith on how to proceed with further exploration under this Contract.<br /><br />
Subsequently, if no agreement is reached concerning a mutually<br /><br />
acceptable Exploration Programme then all the areas outside the<br /><br />
Development Areas shall be relinquished within 3 (three) years.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if there<br /><br />
exists a conflict in the provisions of this Article 8 and the<br /><br />
relinquishment provisions required under Article 5.1, then the<br /><br />
provisions of Article 5.1 shall prevail.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
8.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />

8.11<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor will diligently continue rehabilitation work in the<br /><br />
Development Areas throughout the term of the Contract or until, in the<br /><br />
Contractor's view, production declines to an uneconomic level, in order<br /><br />
to achieve the most efficient rate of production for the fields. If the<br /><br />
Contractor determines that production from such Development Areas has<br /><br />
declined to an uneconomic level, then the Contractor shall immediately<br /><br />
relinquish any such uneconomic Development Areas. Nothing in this<br /><br />
Article 8.11 should prevent the Contractor suspending operations<br /><br />
temporarily through cyclical falls in the price of oil or gas.<br /><br />

an abandonment and site restoration fund estimated from time<br /><br />
to time to be sufficient to fund those measures and placed in<br /><br />
a special interest bearing US$ account ("the Special<br /><br />
Account"), to be held in the joint names of the State Agency<br /><br />
and the Contractor and dedicated exclusively to meeting<br /><br />
expenditures for abandonment and site restoration. Except as<br /><br />
provided in Article 17.4 of the Petroleum Law, no taxes shall<br /><br />
be imposed on any amounts paid into, received or earned by, or<br /><br />
held in the Special Account and payments made into the Special<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Unless, not later than one Year prior to date on which the<br /><br />
rights of the Contractor under this Contract will terminate,<br /><br />
the State has informed the Contractor by notice in writing<br /><br />
that on termination another contractor, or Georgian Oil, will<br /><br />
take over the Development Area as a going concern, the<br /><br />
Contractor will be responsible for carrying out the<br /><br />
abandonment and site restoration programme here in this<br /><br />
Article described proceeding with all due diligence and in the<br /><br />
event that the funds available in the special interest bearing<br /><br />
account are insufficient for that purpose, will make up the<br /><br />
shortfall.<br /><br />

9.8.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In respect of the obligations of the Contractor under Article<br /><br />
9.8.1, this Contract shall, notwithstanding the provision of<br /><br />
Article 4, remain in force until the Contractor has discharged<br /><br />
those obligations in full, and for that purpose the provisions<br /><br />
of Article 30 shall continue to be applicable.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
9.8.3<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Subject to the terms of this Contract, the Contractor shall carry out,<br /><br />
at its own expense and financial risk, all the necessary Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations to implement an approved Development Plan. However, if the<br /><br />
Contractor is able to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the<br /><br />
Coordination Committee that exploitation turns out not to be<br /><br />
commercially profitable, the Coordination Committee shall decide on the<br /><br />
steps to be taken as a consequence of such an event, and the Contractor<br /><br />
shall not be obligated to continue implementation of the original<br /><br />
Development Plan.<br /><br />

The Contractor shall have the right to use free of charge Petroleum<br /><br />
produced from the Contract Area to the extent required for Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations under the Contract. The amount of Petroleum which the<br /><br />
Contractor shall be entitled to use for Petroleum Operations shall not<br /><br />
exceed the amount which would be expected to be used in accordance with<br /><br />
international Petroleum industry practice in the exercise of Good<br /><br />
Oilfield Practices. For the avoidance of doubt, such Petroleum shall be<br /><br />
used only for the benefit of Petroleum Operations and not for the<br /><br />
personal gain of any Party.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Available Crude Oil and Available Natural Gas shall be measured at the<br /><br />

<br /><br />
To the extent that in a Calendar Quarter outstanding recoverable Costs<br /><br />
and Expenses related to the Contract Area exceed the value of all Cost<br /><br />
Recovery Crude Oil and Cost Recovery Natural Gas for such Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter, the excess shall be carried forward for recovery in the next<br /><br />
succeeding Calendar Quarters until fully recovered, but in no case<br /><br />
after termination of the Contract. In amplification of the foregoing a<br /><br />
full audit shall be undertaken in every Calendar Year to ensure<br /><br />
compliance, among other matters, with the principles of Article 11.5.<br /><br />

11.10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Following recovery of Costs and Expenses from Cost Recovery Petroleum<br /><br />
in each Calendar Quarter in accordance with the provisions of this<br /><br />
Article 11, the remaining Petroleum, including any portion of Cost<br /><br />
Recovery Petroleum not then required or available for recovery of Costs<br /><br />
and Expenses (hereinafter referred to as "Profit Oil" or "Profit<br /><br />
Natural Gas") shall be allocated in each Calendar Quarter between<br /><br />
Georgian Oil and the Contractor as follows:<br /><br />
11.10.1 Fifty percent (50%) of the Profit Oil (and Profit Natural Gas)<br /><br />
resulting from Petroleum Operations will be allocated to<br /><br />
Georgian Oil and fifty percent (50%) to the Contractor, so<br /><br />
long as the cumulative Costs and Expenses, plus finance costs<br /><br />
incurred by the Contractor exceed the value of the cumulative<br /><br />
Cost Recovery Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and cumulative<br /><br />
Profit Natural Gas given to the Contractor, calculated from<br /><br />
the Effective Date to the end of the prior quarter.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.10.2 If at any time the value of the cumulative Cost Recovery<br /><br />
Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and cumulative Profit Natural<br /><br />
Gas delivered to the Contractor exceeds the cumulative Costs<br /><br />
and Expenses, plus interest incurred by the Contractor (but<br /><br />
excluding interest already included in Costs and Expenses and<br /><br />
excluding interest on interest), then seventy percent (70%) of<br /><br />
the Profit Oil (and Profit Natural Gas) resulting from<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations will be allocated to Georgian Oil and<br /><br />
thirty percent<br /><br />

Notwithstanding Articles 11.5 and 11.10, when the value of the<br /><br />
cumulative Cost Recovery Petroleum, cumulative Profit Oil and<br /><br />
cumulative Profit Natural Gas delivered to the Contractor exceeds the<br /><br />
cumulative Costs and Expenses, plus finance costs incurred by the<br /><br />
Contractor, and calculated from the Effective Date to the end of the<br /><br />
prior quarter, then Georgian Oil will be entitled to receive, as a<br /><br />
priority, up to 250,000 tons of oil (or oil equivalent) from a maximum<br /><br />
of fifty percent (50%) per Calendar Quarter of all Available Crude Oil<br /><br />
and Available Natural Gas from the Contract Area (the Base Level Oil).<br /><br />
11.11.1 During the period that Base Level Oil is being delivered to<br /><br />
Georgian Oil, the Contractor shall be entitled to recover all<br /><br />
Costs and Expenses, calculated from the Effective Date to the<br /><br />
end of the prior quarter incurred in respect of Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations, as Cost Recovery Petroleum from a maximum of fifty<br /><br />
percent (50%) per Calendar Quarter of the remaining Available<br /><br />
Crude.<br /><br />
11.11.2 During the period that Base Level Oil is being delivered to<br /><br />
Georgian Oil, after delivery of Base Level Oil and Cost<br /><br />
Recovery Petroleum the remaining Available Crude Oil and<br /><br />
Available Natural Gas resulting from Petroleum Operations in<br /><br />
the Contract Area will be allocated as Profit Oil (and Profit<br /><br />
Natural Gas) with fifty percent (50%) being delivered to<br /><br />
Georgian Oil and fifty percent (50%) being delivered to the<br /><br />
Contractor.<br /><br />

have no title to any Petroleum.<br /><br />
Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall agree on procedures for taking<br /><br />
volumes of Crude Oil corresponding to their respective entitlements on<br /><br />
a regular basis and in a manner that is appropriate having regard to<br /><br />
the respective destinations and uses of the Crude Oil, all in<br /><br />
accordance with the provisions of this Contract. If necessary, Georgian<br /><br />
Oil and the Contractor will enter into a lifting agreement setting out<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the agreed procedures for taking volumes of Crude Oil, and such<br /><br />
agreement shall comply with the principles of Good Oilfield Practices.<br /><br />

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS VALUATION<br /><br />
12.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The value of Crude Oil that constitutes Cost Recovery Crude Oil and is<br /><br />
sold by Contractor to Third Parties in "fairly valued" transactions<br /><br />
shall be the net realised price (i.e., after deducting commissions and<br /><br />
brokerages) ex works at the Measurement Point. The sale is "fairly<br /><br />
valued" if<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the price is the sole consideration for the sale; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the terms of the sale are not affected by any commercial<br /><br />
relationship, other than that created by the contract of sale<br /><br />
itself, between the seller or an Affiliate and the buyer or an<br /><br />
Affiliate; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the seller or an Affiliate does not have any interest in the<br /><br />
subsequent resale or disposal of the Crude Oil or any product<br /><br />
derived therefrom.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is the intent of the Parties that the value of Cost Recovery<br /><br />
Petroleum that is sold by Contractor other than to Third Parties in<br /><br />
"fairly valued" transactions shall reflect the prevailing international<br /><br />
market price for Crude Oil saved and sold from the Contract Area ex<br /><br />
works the Measurement Point. For the purpose of determining the value<br /><br />
and allocation of Cost Recovery Petroleum taken and disposed of by the<br /><br />
Parties and/or their assignees under this Contract during each Calendar<br /><br />
Quarter, Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall agree upon a basket of<br /><br />
no more than four (4) Crude Oils freely traded in international<br /><br />
markets, and the value of Cost Recovery Petroleum shall be adjusted to<br /><br />
reflect the weighted average daily f.o.b. prices for term contract<br /><br />
sales from Petroleum producing countries in international markets for<br /><br />
the same Calendar Quarter of such basket of Crude Oils, it being<br /><br />
understood that the following principles will apply:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each of such basket marker Crude Oils shall originate from the<br /><br />
closest<br /><br />
49<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
geographic location to the Contract Area as possible and have<br /><br />
the same primary geographic market as the Contract Area Crude<br /><br />
Oil being valued. The weighted average of the basket shall be<br /><br />
such that the average gravity, sulphur content and product<br /><br />
yield of the basket and the average gravity, sulphur content<br /><br />
and product yield of the Crude Oil produced under this<br /><br />
Contract shall approximate each other as nearly as is<br /><br />
possible; and<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The prices for individual referenced Crude Oil markers used<br /><br />
within the basket shall be based upon the numerical average of<br /><br />
a daily report of the actual price for each referenced Crude<br /><br />
Oil marker as published in agreed internationally recognised<br /><br />
publications; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Adjustment provisions will be incorporated into the basket<br /><br />
formula to take account of transportation costs and location<br /><br />
differentials between the marker basket of Crude Oils and the<br /><br />
Crude Oil produced under this Contract arriving at a<br /><br />
designated sales point (where the sales point is not the<br /><br />
Measurement Point) and to take account of gravity and sulphur<br /><br />
content variation beyond a pre-agreed range; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor's third party fairly valued sales prices received<br /><br />
for Crude Oil produced under this Contract shall be the basis<br /><br />
used to determine appropriate changes to the adjustments set<br /><br />
out in (iii) above;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless agreed otherwise, the last calculated weighted average<br /><br />
basket price shall serve as the provisional price for a<br /><br />
Calendar Quarter until a new price is determined.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that Georgian Oil and the Contractor are unable to agree<br /><br />
upon the<br /><br />
50<br /><br />
basket of Crude Oils envisaged in Article 12.2 above, or the principles<br /><br />
relating thereto, then either Georgian Oil or the Contractor or both of<br /><br />
them jointly may pursuant to Article 30, refer the matter or matters in<br /><br />
issue for determination by a Sole Expert. Pending such determination,<br /><br />
the price shall be as determined under Article 12.2 (iv) above.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
12.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Natural Gas shall be valued at the actual revenues received by<br /><br />
Contractor less transportation, storage, treatment, processing,<br /><br />
liquefaction and all other associated costs incurred by the Contractor<br /><br />
beyond the Measurement Point in supplying Natural gas to customers<br /><br />
beyond the Measurement Point. If the Contractor bears the cost of<br /><br />
installing and operating the pipeline required to transport Natural Gas<br /><br />
produced from the Contract Area to the market for such Natural Gas and<br /><br />
such pipeline is located downstream of the Measurement Point, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall be entitled to deduct a tariff from the sales price of<br /><br />
the Natural Gas for the purpose of determining the value of Cost<br /><br />
Recovery Petroleum. The tariff associated with such natural gas<br /><br />
pipeline shall be computed on the basis of the investment incurred in<br /><br />
such pipeline, the operating costs of such pipeline and a reasonable<br /><br />
return on Contractor's investment.<br /><br />

ANCILLARY RIGHTS OF THE CONTRACTOR AND OPERATING COMPANY<br /><br />
<br /><br />
13.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The State and Georgian Oil shall provide or otherwise procure access<br /><br />
for the Contractor to all existing facilities and infrastructure, which<br /><br />
is available on an open access basis for private commercial purposes,<br /><br />
which for the sake of clarification does not include such facilities or<br /><br />
infrastructure subject to contractual or treaty obligations or<br /><br />
restrictions, in the Contract Area owned by the State or Georgian Oil<br /><br />
necessary for the purpose of carrying out Petroleum Operations during<br /><br />
the term of the Contract. Such access shall be on terms as regards<br /><br />
access and tariffs no less favourable than the best terms then being<br /><br />

MEASUREMENT OF PETROLEUM<br /><br />
15.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All Petroleum produced, Saved and not used in the Petroleum Operations<br /><br />
in accordance with Article 11.3 shall be measured at the Measurement<br /><br />
Point. Georgian Oil and State Agency shall be afforded access to the<br /><br />
Measurement Point by Contractor as long as such access does not<br /><br />
significantly interfere with Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Measurement Point shall be at the end of the facilities for which<br /><br />
the costs are included as Costs and Expenses. The Measurement Point<br /><br />
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set out in<br /><br />
Articles 9 and 11.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All Petroleum shall be measured in accordance with standards generally<br /><br />
acceptable in the international Petroleum industry and certified<br /><br />
Georgian standards. All measurement equipment shall be installed,<br /><br />
maintained and operated by the Contractor. The Contractor and Georgian<br /><br />
Oil and State Agency shall be entitled periodically to inspect the<br /><br />
measuring equipment installed and all charts and other measurement or<br /><br />
test data at all reasonable times. The accuracy of measuring equipment<br /><br />
shall be verified by tests at regular intervals and upon request by<br /><br />
State Agency or Georgian Oil or the Contractor, using means and methods<br /><br />
generally accepted in the international Petroleum industry.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Should a meter malfunction occur, the Contractor shall immediately have<br /><br />
the meter repaired, adjusted and corrected and following such repairs,<br /><br />
adjustment or correction shall have it tested or calibrated to<br /><br />
establish its accuracy. Upon the discovery of metering error, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall have the meter tested immediately and shall take the<br /><br />
necessary steps to correct any error that may be discovered.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
15.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event a measuring error is discovered, the Contractor shall use<br /><br />
all reasonable efforts to determine the correct production figures for<br /><br />
the period during which there<br /><br />
60<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
was a measuring error and correct previously used readings. The<br /><br />
Contractor shall submit to the Co-ordination Committee and State Agency<br /><br />
a report on the corrections carried out. In determining the correction,<br /><br />
the Contractor shall use, where required, the information from other<br /><br />
measurements made inside or outside the Development Area. If it proves<br /><br />
impossible to determine when the measuring error first occurred, the<br /><br />
commencement of the error shall be deemed to be the point in time<br /><br />
halfway between the date of the last previous test and the date on<br /><br />
which the existence of the measuring error was first discovered.<br /><br />
15.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All measurements for all purposes in this Contract shall be adjusted to<br /><br />
standard conditions of pressure at sea level and temperature at sixty<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
16.1.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas produced within the Contract Area shall<br /><br />
be used primarily for purposes related to the Production<br /><br />
Operations and production enhancement, including, without<br /><br />
limitation, oil treating, gas injection, gas lifting and power<br /><br />
generation.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.1.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Based on the principle of full utilisation of the Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas and with no impediment to normal production of the<br /><br />
Crude Oil, any Development Plan shall include a plan of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
utilisation of Associated Natural Gas. If there is any excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas remaining in any Oil Field after<br /><br />
utilisation pursuant to Article 16.1.1 (hereafter referred to<br /><br />
as "Excess Associated Natural Gas"), the Contractor shall<br /><br />
carry out a feasibility study regarding the commercial<br /><br />
utilisation of such Excess Associated Natural Gas.<br /><br />
If Georgian Oil and the Contractor agree that Excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas has no commercial value, then such<br /><br />
Natural Gas shall be disposed of by the Contractor through<br /><br />
reinjection, venting, flaring or otherwise as may be provided<br /><br />
in an approved Development Plan, and subject to approval from<br /><br />
the State Agency.<br /><br />
If Georgian Oil and the Contractor agree that Excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas has commercial value, they will<br /><br />
endeavour to enter into gas sales agreement(s) and/or other<br /><br />
commercial and/or technical arrangements with Third Parties<br /><br />
required to develop such Natural Gas. Investments in the<br /><br />
facilities necessary for production, transportation and<br /><br />
delivery of Excess Associated Natural Gas shall be made by the<br /><br />
Contractor.<br /><br />
62<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
If either Georgian Oil or the Contractor considers that Excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas has commercial value while the other<br /><br />
considers that Excess Associated Natural Gas has no commercial<br /><br />
value, the one who considers Excess Associated Natural Gas to<br /><br />
have commercial value may utilise such Excess Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas, at its own cost and expense and without impeding<br /><br />
the production of Crude Oil and without affecting the shares<br /><br />
of Crude Oil and Natural Gas otherwise to be allocated under<br /><br />
the other provisions of this Contract, but if such Excess<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas is not so utilised at any time or from<br /><br />
time to time, then such Excess Associated Natural Gas shall be<br /><br />
disposed of by the Contractor, in a manner approved by the<br /><br />
State Agency.<br /><br />
16.1.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Investments made in conjunction with the utilisation of both<br /><br />
Associated Natural Gas and Excess Associated Natural Gas,<br /><br />
together with investments incurred after approval of a<br /><br />
Development Plan in carrying out feasibility studies on the<br /><br />
utilisation of Excess Associated Natural Gas, shall be Costs<br /><br />
and Expenses.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
16.2.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
When any Non-associated Natural Gas is discovered within the<br /><br />
Contract Area, the Contractor may present proposals for<br /><br />
appraisal and development as follows:<br /><br />
After Non-associated Natural Gas has been discovered within<br /><br />
the Contract Area, the Contractor shall present to the<br /><br />
Co-ordination Committee, a report, including, without<br /><br />
limitation, an initial estimate of the boundaries of the<br /><br />
Non-associated Natural Gas Reservoir and a range of<br /><br />
recoverable reserves.<br /><br />
The Contractor shall be required to decide whether to submit<br /><br />
an Appraisal Programme as soon as is practical in all the<br /><br />
circumstances but not later than thirty-six (36) Months from<br /><br />
the date of the submission of the<br /><br />
63<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
discovery report.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor commits to an approved Appraisal Programme<br /><br />
for the Non-associated Natural Gas Reservoir, delineation and<br /><br />
review of the potential of the Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
Reservoir will continue for a period not longer than three (3)<br /><br />
Years from the Approval of the Appraisal Programme. During the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
review period and the period of the Appraisal Programme, the<br /><br />
Contractor shall maintain all rights and interests in the<br /><br />
relevant portion of the Contract Area.<br /><br />
The expenses incurred by the Contractor in carrying out the<br /><br />
said review, evaluation and Appraisal Programme shall be Costs<br /><br />
and Expenses.<br /><br />
16.2.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Following the completion and review of the Appraisal<br /><br />
Programme, the Contractor shall submit an appraisal report to<br /><br />
the Co-ordination Committee and may submit a Development Plan<br /><br />
for approval in accordance with Article 9.5. Georgian Oil and<br /><br />
the Contractor shall also endeavour to finalise Gas Sales<br /><br />
Contract(s) and other agreements necessary for the commercial<br /><br />
exploitation of such Non-associated Natural Gas.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.2.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise agreed between the Contractor and Georgian<br /><br />
Oil, all Non-associated Natural Gas (and excess Associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas) produced from the Contract Area under a<br /><br />
Development Plan which has been approved, or deemed to have<br /><br />
been approved, by the Co-ordination Committee shall be sold by<br /><br />
the Contractor on its own behalf and as agent for Georgian Oil<br /><br />
on a joint dedicated basis on terms common to both Parties.<br /><br />
Every such agreement shall require the express approval of<br /><br />
Georgian Oil which shall not be unreasonably withheld.<br /><br />
Georgian Oil may engage independent experts, as proper and<br /><br />
reasonable, to make the necessary examination of any such<br /><br />
agreement the costs of which shall be reimbursed to Georgian<br /><br />
Oil by the Contractor and shall constitute Costs and Expenses.<br /><br />

Where Non-associated Natural Gas (or excess Associated Natural<br /><br />
Gas) is sold by the Contractor on a joint dedicated basis<br /><br />
pursuant to Article 16.2.3, the provisions of Article 11,<br /><br />
relating to the allocation of Petroleum for recovery of costs<br /><br />
and production sharing, shall apply to the distribution of the<br /><br />
proceeds from the sale of Non-associated Natural Gas with<br /><br />
effect that Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall have title<br /><br />
in undivided shares to the Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
available for sale on a joint dedicated basis and will hold<br /><br />
those shares in undivided proportions equal to the proportions<br /><br />
in which during that period they were entitled to share<br /><br />
available Petroleum. Accordingly the net proceeds from the<br /><br />
sale on a joint dedicated basis of Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
in any given period shall be divided between Georgian Oil and<br /><br />
the Contractor in the proportions in which they had title to<br /><br />
the Non-associated Natural Gas sold.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.2.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The production period for any Non-associated Natural Gas<br /><br />
within the Contract Area shall be a period equal to the<br /><br />
greater of the term of the Gas Sales Contract(s) or other<br /><br />
commercial Natural Gas agreement for such Non-associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas and twenty-five (25) consecutive Years beginning<br /><br />
on the date of commencement of Commercial Production of such<br /><br />
Non-associated Natural Gas. Such period shall not exceed the<br /><br />
maximum term of the Contract, plus any extensions permitted<br /><br />
under Article 4,2. Georgian Oil and the Contractor shall<br /><br />
endeavour to conclude Gas Sales Contract(s) and implement a<br /><br />
Development Plan for Non-associated Natural Gas so as to<br /><br />
deplete each Reservoir within its production period and within<br /><br />
the term of this Contract, subject always to the application<br /><br />
of Good Oilfield Practices.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
16.2.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event that the development of Non-associated Natural<br /><br />
Gas appears to be uneconomic under the provisions of this<br /><br />
Contract, the Parties shall meet to discuss amending the terms<br /><br />
of this Contract. In the event the<br /><br />
65<br /><br />
Parties are unable to agree upon modifications to make<br /><br />
development, production, and marketing of a Non-associated<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Natural Gas discovery economic to the Contractor, the State<br /><br />
and Georgian Oil agree that they will not enter into any<br /><br />
arrangements for the development of such Non-associated<br /><br />
Natural Gas discovery with any Third Parties under less<br /><br />
favourable terms to the State and Georgian Oil than the<br /><br />
Contractor's last offer under the negotiations above, without<br /><br />
first offering such development and terms to the Contractor.<br /><br />
State and Georgian Oil shall notify Contractor in writing<br /><br />
within thirty (30) days of receipt of any such offer, giving<br /><br />
the full details of such offer. Contractor shall have one<br /><br />
hundred eighty (180) days following its receipt of notice of<br /><br />
the Third Party offer to match the offer. This right of first<br /><br />
refusal shall run concurrent with the term of this Contract<br /><br />
and shall survive the expiration or termination of this<br /><br />
Contract for a period of five (5) years. If the Third Party<br /><br />
offer to the State and Georgian Oil is on more favourable<br /><br />
commercial terms to the State and Georgian Oil than<br /><br />

24.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall not be liable to the State, Georgian Oil or Third<br /><br />
Parties for any damages caused by contamination entering the Contract<br /><br />
Area as a result of State, Georgian Oil or Third Party activities<br /><br />
beyond or within the boundaries of the Contract Area. The State shall<br /><br />
be legally and financially responsible for any loss, damage and<br /><br />
liability, including remediation of environmental conditions which may<br /><br />
be required for safe conduct of the Petroleum Operations, caused by the<br /><br />
State's or Georgian Oil's activities beyond or within the Contract<br /><br />
Area.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
24.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or damage, including<br /><br />
but not limited to spillage, explosion, contamination or similar<br /><br />
environmental damage, in respect of any storage facilities, pipelines<br /><br />

or the Operating Company. In addition to the foregoing, the Contractor<br /><br />
shall not be liable for any damage whatsoever in respect of the State<br /><br />

from loss, injury and damage resulting from war (declared or<br /><br />
undeclared), civil conflict, sabotage, blockade, riot, terrorism,<br /><br />
unlawful commercial extortion, or organised crime. Notwithstanding<br /><br />
anything to the contrary contained herein, Contractor acknowledges and<br /><br />
agrees that the obligations undertaken by the State in this Article<br /><br />
24.9 are no greater than the general obligations of the State towards<br /><br />
citizens of Georgia in respect to the perils named above. Furthermore,<br /><br />
Contractor agrees that it shall have no claim for legal or equitable<br /><br />
relief for failure of the State to comply with the provisions of<br /><br />
Article 24.9, except as may be permitted by law.<br /><br />

ARTICLE 25<br /><br />
FORCE MAJEURE<br /><br />
25.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If as a result of Force Majeure, any Party, including the Contractor is<br /><br />
rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out its obligations under<br /><br />
this Contract, other than the obligation to pay any amounts of money<br /><br />
due, then the obligations of such Party so far as and to the extent<br /><br />
that the obligations are affected by such Force Majeure, shall be<br /><br />
suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused, but for no<br /><br />
longer period.<br /><br />
Such Party shall notify all other Parties of the Force Majeure<br /><br />
situation within (14) Days of becoming aware of the circumstances<br /><br />
relied upon and shall keep all other Parties informed of all<br /><br />
significant developments. Such notice shall give reasonably full<br /><br />
particulars of the said Force Majeure, and also estimate the period of<br /><br />
time which such Party will probably require to remedy the Force<br /><br />
Majeure. Failure to give any such notification in a timely fashion<br /><br />
shall mean that the period of Force Majeure shall be deemed to have<br /><br />
commenced on the date of the giving of such notice.<br /><br />
The affected Party shall use all reasonable diligence to remove or<br /><br />
overcome or avoid the Force Majeure situation as quickly as possible in<br /><br />
an economic manner. The period of any such non-performance or delay,<br /><br />
together with such period as may be necessary for the restoration of<br /><br />
any damage done during such delay, shall be added to the time given in<br /><br />
this Contract for the performance of any obligation dependent thereon<br /><br />
and the continuation of any right granted; provided, however, the term<br /><br />
of this Contract shall be not be extended as a result of<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
any particular event of Force Majeure, if the duration of any<br /><br />
such particular event of Force Majeure which, together with<br /><br />
any period of time required for restoration, is for a period<br /><br />
of 30 Days or less; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the enactment or adoption of a law, rule or regulation by the<br /><br />
State or any local or legislative body of or within Georgia,<br /><br />
whether acting directly or through Georgian Oil, if such law,<br /><br />
rule or regulation is comparable to one which has<br /><br />
98<br /><br />
been enacted or adopted, on or before the date the Contract is<br /><br />
signed, by a member nation of the European Union or any<br /><br />
legislative or regulatory body of the European Union.<br /><br />
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, no<br /><br />
<br /><br />
event shall constitute Force Majeure if it does not delay or<br /><br />
prevent the Contractor from engaging in the conduct of<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations.<br /><br />
For the purposes of this Contract, "Force Majeure" shall mean natural<br /><br />
calamities, strikes, sabotage and other production disorders, civil<br /><br />
disturbance, war (declared or undeclared), or other military actions,<br /><br />
terrorist or guerrilla activity, blockade, revolt, earthquake,<br /><br />
avalanche, orders, laws or decrees of any state or governmental entity<br /><br />
of any country, or other similar events beyond the control of the Party<br /><br />
claiming Force Majeure which could not have been prevented by it. [No<br /><br />
change]<br /><br />
25.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The exercise by Georgian Oil or by State Agency of any right under this<br /><br />
Contract shall not constitute Force Majeure under any circumstance<br /><br />
<br /><br />
25.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
It is recognised that a Force Majeure event may pertain only to part of<br /><br />
the Contract Area. In the event part of the License is in Force Majeure<br /><br />
when a Work Programme or a relinquishment become due, then the Work<br /><br />
Programme and/or relinquishment required shall be reduced in size by a<br /><br />
ratio proportionate to the area in Force Majeure divided by the full<br /><br />
size of the then current Contract Area.<br /><br />
Likewise, the time period for a Work Programme and/or relinquishment<br /><br />
for any area under Force Majeure shall be suspended for the time it is<br /><br />
under Force Majeure.<br /><br />

ASSIGNMENTS AND GUARANTEES<br /><br />
26.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No assignment, mortgage or charge or other encumbrance or transfer (for<br /><br />
the purposes of this Article 26, all of the foregoing an "assignment"<br /><br />
and correlatives thereof) shall be made by the Contractor of its rights<br /><br />
obligations or interests arising under this Contract other than in<br /><br />
accordance with the provisions of this Article 26.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Except in case of an assignment made pursuant to the provisions of<br /><br />
Articles 26.4 and 26.5, the provisions of this Section 26.2 shall first<br /><br />
apply. Any Party, (which shall include Georgian Oil, or any other<br /><br />
successor entity owned by the State, from and after its exercise of its<br /><br />
rights under this Section pursuant to which it shall have become a<br /><br />
Contractor by acquiring the rights of a Contractor or otherwise shall<br /><br />
become a Contractor), wishing to assign all or part of its rights and<br /><br />
interests hereunder or in any circumstances where there is deemed to be<br /><br />
an assignment shall first give written notice to the other Parties<br /><br />
specifying the proposed terms and conditions of the assignment.<br /><br />
Following receipt of those terms and conditions, for a period of thirty<br /><br />
(30) Days, each Party shall have the preferential right to match the<br /><br />
terms and conditions of the proposed assignment or deemed assignment.<br /><br />
This right may be exercised by any Party giving written notice within<br /><br />
said period of its intention to match the relevant terms and conditions<br /><br />
(the "Acceptance") and thereafter the relevant Parties shall negotiate<br /><br />
all necessary documentation. If, within a further period of sixty (60)<br /><br />
Days from the receipt of the Acceptance, the relevant Parties have not<br /><br />
reached substantially final agreement, the Party seeking to assign may<br /><br />
within a further period of thirty (30) Days complete an assignment to a<br /><br />
Third Party on the same terms and conditions. In amplification of the<br /><br />
foregoing sentence and for the avoidance of any doubt, any assignment<br /><br />
to a Third Party shall be subject to the assigning Party and the Third<br /><br />
Party complying with the provisions of this Article 26.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Contractor may assign all or part of its rights, obligations and<br /><br />
interests arising from this Contract, and the Parent Company may,<br /><br />
whether directly or indirectly, assign Control of a Contractor Party,<br /><br />
to a Third Party or another Contractor provided that<br /><br />
100<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
any such assignee:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.3.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
has the technical and financial ability to perform the<br /><br />
obligations to be assumed by it under the Contract; provided,<br /><br />
however, that the technical or financial ability or experience<br /><br />
of a prospective assignee shall not be assumed merely because<br /><br />
such assignee has the financial ability or technical ability<br /><br />
or experience of the assigning Contractor Party or its Parent<br /><br />
Company, whether singly or collectively, or has already become<br /><br />
another Contractor Party;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.3.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
accepts and assumes all of the terms and conditions of the<br /><br />
Contract, including providing a Parent Company Guarantee;<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.3.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
is an entity with which the State, Georgian Oil and the<br /><br />
Contractor can legally do business.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any such assignment shall be subject to the prior written consent of<br /><br />
the State Agency which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or<br /><br />
delayed. Georgian Oil shall be deemed to have approved any assignment<br /><br />
to which the State Agency has consented.<br /><br />
By way of clarification and not in limitation of the foregoing<br /><br />
provisions of this Article, the State shall not be considered to be<br /><br />
acting unreasonably in declining to consent to any such assignment if<br /><br />
the assignment to such proposed assignee is deemed contrary to State<br /><br />
interests, as evidenced by a writing to that effect signed by the<br /><br />
President, the State Minister or State Chancellor/Secretary, or the<br /><br />
Minister of Foreign Affairs or Defence or there is an act of Parliament<br /><br />
to that effect.<br /><br />
If within thirty (30) Days following notification of an intended<br /><br />
assignment, accompanied by a copy of the proposed deed of assignment<br /><br />
and related documentation with respect to the proposed assignee,<br /><br />
including certified financial statements and other evidence to the<br /><br />
State's reasonable satisfaction of the matters set forth in Article<br /><br />
26.3.1 and such documentation, which shall include evidence of<br /><br />
101<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
the identity of owners of the assignee, provided in the case of a<br /><br />
company the stock of which is registered on a recognised stock<br /><br />
exchange, a copy of the documents identifying the significant owners,<br /><br />
as such concept is defined or used in the applicable laws pursuant to<br /><br />
which such company registered its stock, will satisfy the foregoing<br /><br />
requirements, and its direct and indirect parent companies, including<br /><br />
the identity of the owners of the ultimate parent, subject to the<br /><br />
foregoing proviso, as may be reasonably necessary for the State, and as<br /><br />
requested by the State, to make a determination of the State interests<br /><br />
as described above, the State has not given its written decision<br /><br />
concerning such assignment, then it shall be deemed that the State has<br /><br />
declined to give such consent; provided that thereafter if upon the<br /><br />
further written request of the Contractor for a written decision, the<br /><br />
State has not given a written response of any kind within fifteen (15)<br /><br />
Days after such further request, then the assignment shall be deemed<br /><br />
approved and the State shall execute an assignment, in the form<br /><br />
contemplated in Article 26.8 accepting such assignment. This second<br /><br />
request from the Contractor shall cite the provisions of this paragraph<br /><br />
and the Contractor shall obtain confirmation from the State that the<br /><br />
request has been received.<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 26.3, Contractor may assign<br /><br />
all or part of its rights, obligations and interests arising from this<br /><br />
Contract to an Affiliate without the prior consent of the State or<br /><br />
Georgian Oil, provided that any such Affiliate:<br /><br />
26.4.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
has the technical and financial ability and experience to<br /><br />
perform the obligations to be assumed by it under the<br /><br />
Contract; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.4.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
accepts and assumes all of the terms and conditions of the<br /><br />
Contract as if the Affiliate had originally been a signatory<br /><br />
to this Contract.<br /><br />
102<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In the event of such an assignment, the Parent Company shall provide an<br /><br />
undertaking to the State guaranteeing that it holds ultimate control of<br /><br />
its Affiliate and ultimate responsibility for the rights and<br /><br />
responsibilities of the Affiliate.<br /><br />
If such Affiliate shall be less that 100%, directly and indirectly<br /><br />
owned by the Parent Company, then the consent of the State shall be<br /><br />
required, but may not be withheld unless the Parent Company does not<br /><br />
have voting control over all decisions of the proposed assignee,<br /><br />
whether such decisions are exercised as stockholder or indirectly<br /><br />
through the board of directors or other governing body of such<br /><br />
assignee, provided, however, the election or appointment of a resident<br /><br />
or citizen of the nation or territory, where an entity is incorporated,<br /><br />
as a member of the board of directors or other governing body of such<br /><br />
entity or the ownership of a nominal equity interest in such entity by<br /><br />
any such person to satisfy the mandatory requirements of any applicable<br /><br />
law of such nation or territory shall not be deemed to negate the<br /><br />
satisfaction of the foregoing. The Contractor shall provide the State<br /><br />
with such evidence that the State may reasonably request to satisfy the<br /><br />
State that it does not have the right to decline to give its consent<br /><br />
based on the provisions of the foregoing provision.<br /><br />
If the Parent Company wishes to assign its direct or indirect Control<br /><br />
of a Contractor Party to an Affiliate which is 100% directly or<br /><br />
indirectly owned by the Parent Company, then the consent of the State<br /><br />
shall not be required.<br /><br />
26.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
Provided that Contractor has obtained the prior consent of the State<br /><br />
(not to be unreasonably withheld) as contemplated in Article 26.3,<br /><br />
Contractor and its assignees shall not be restricted in any way and<br /><br />
shall not be required to obtain any<br /><br />
103<br /><br />
additional consent for any pledge or assignment of their respective<br /><br />
interests in this Contract or any Petroleum Operations undertaken<br /><br />
pursuant hereto to any bank, lender or other person providing financing<br /><br />
in connection with this Contract or such Petroleum Operations and if<br /><br />
such bank, lender or other person shall foreclose upon such interest<br /><br />
pledged or assigned, such bank, lender or person shall become entitled<br /><br />
to the rights, and subject to the obligations of an assignee hereunder.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Georgian Oil may assign its rights, obligations and interests arising<br /><br />
from this Contract (including, but not limited to, all or part of its<br /><br />
right to lift a share of Profit Oil); provided, however,<br /><br />
notwithstanding the provisions of Article 26, the obligations of<br /><br />
Georgian Oil under this Contract may, and may only, be assigned to<br /><br />
another majority owned State entity.The provisions of this Article 26.6<br /><br />
shall not apply to the assignment of any rights that Georgian Oil may<br /><br />
hold as a Contractor Party.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.7<br /><br />
<br /><br />
No Taxes, fees or other charges shall be payable to the State or to<br /><br />
Georgian Oil as a consequence of any assignment; provided, however,<br /><br />
appropriate Administrative Fees, including the reasonable and proper<br /><br />
fees of any independent advisors, may be charged, including for a<br /><br />
review of the appropriate documents and payment for re-registration of<br /><br />
the license.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.8<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Every assignment under this Article shall be evidenced by an<br /><br />
assignment, incorporating all the terms hereinabove provided in this<br /><br />
Article 26, including those contemplated in Article 26.7, and shall be<br /><br />
executed by all of the State, Georgian Oil, the assignor and assignee<br /><br />
and all other appropriate Parties, which assignment shall include<br /><br />
provisions whereby the assignee, accept and assume all of the terms and<br /><br />
conditions of this Contract. In addition, a Parent Company Guarantee<br /><br />
shall also be provided by the applicable Parent Company. Such<br /><br />
assignment instrument and Parent Company Guarantee shall be subject to<br /><br />
the reasonable satisfaction of the State.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
26.9<br /><br />
<br /><br />
In this Article 26, "Control" shall mean the ownership or control of<br /><br />
such interests in an entity as to enable a person or persons acting<br /><br />
together to exercise, directly or through another entity or entities,<br /><br />
management control or establish management<br /><br />
<br /><br />
104<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
<br /><br />
policy. Equity ownership of a majority of the outstanding ownership<br /><br />
interests in any entity shall be deemed to constitute Control. In<br /><br />
clarification of the foregoing, a change in the membership of the board<br /><br />
of directors does not in and of itself constitute a change or loss of<br /><br />
Control.<br /><br />
26.10<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Licence<br /><br />

26.10.1 The Licence shall continue to be held by the re-registered Operating<br /><br />

decrees, rules and regulations, the State shall facilitate the exercise<br /><br />
of the Contractor's activities by granting it all necessary permits,<br /><br />
licenses and access rights as in this Contract set forth so that the<br /><br />
Parties may derive the greatest benefit from Petroleum Operations for<br /><br />
their own benefit and for the benefit of Georgia.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
27.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If at any time after this Amended Production Sharing Contract is<br /><br />
signed, there is a change in the applicable laws of Georgia which:<br /><br />
27.3.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
materially affects the Contractor's or the Operating Company's<br /><br />
conduct of Petroleum Operations in Georgia under this<br /><br />
Contract; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
27.3.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />

which would not have been applicable to the Contractor or the<br /><br />
Operating Company when this Contract was signed or increases<br /><br />
the rates of any Taxes that applied when this Contract was<br /><br />
signed; or<br /><br />
<br /><br />
27.3.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
places an undue material economic burden on the Contractor<br /><br />
which was not present when the Contract was signed;<br /><br />

compliance with the law as amended from time to time, if the<br /><br />
Petroleum Operations carried out by the Contractor or the<br /><br />
Operating Company comply with the provisions of this Contract,<br /><br />
and any relevant plan approved or deemed to be approved by the<br /><br />

in the case of a change falling under Article 27.3.2, the<br /><br />
State and Georgian Oil will, after consultation with the<br /><br />
Contractor, propose alterations to this Contract which will<br /><br />
restore the Contractor, or as the case may be, the Operating<br /><br />
Company, to the same overall economic position which it, or<br /><br />
they, would have enjoyed if the change in the applicable law<br /><br />
had not been made. If the proposal made by the State and<br /><br />
Georgian Oil, or any amendment of that proposal put forward by<br /><br />
the State and Georgian Oil is not accepted by the Contractor<br /><br />
within ninety (90) Days from the date on which a notice in<br /><br />
writing of a proposed amendment is made, any party may refer<br /><br />
the matter in dispute to arbitration in accordance with<br /><br />
Article 30.<br /><br />

in the case of a change falling under Article 27.3.3, the<br /><br />
State and Georgian Oil will, after consultation with the<br /><br />
Contractor, propose alterations to this Contract which will<br /><br />
restore the Contractor, to the same overall economic position<br /><br />

applicable law had not been made. If the proposal made by the<br /><br />
State and Georgian Oil, or any amendment of that proposal put<br /><br />
forward by the State and Georgian Oil is not accepted by the<br /><br />
Contractor within ninety (90) Days from the date on which a<br /><br />
notice in writing of a proposed amendment is made, any party<br /><br />
may refer the matter in dispute to arbitration in accordance<br /><br />
with Article 30.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
27.3.7<br /><br />

Article 29 a "Defaulting Participant") an event occurs of the kind<br /><br />
described in Articles 29.2.2, 29.2.3, 29.2.4 or 29.2.5 or any such<br /><br />

<br /><br />
29.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Where a Default Assignment Notice has been served on a Defaulting<br /><br />
Participant, the Defaulting Participant shall forthwith,<br /><br />
unconditionally, without consideration, and free from all encumbrances,<br /><br />
assign its undivided participating share, including<br /><br />

shares in the Contract and each of the Non-Defaulting Participants<br /><br />
shall be obliged to accept that assignment, including all the<br /><br />

<br /><br />
the State gives not less that thirty (30) Days written notice<br /><br />
("Notice") to the Contractor or, as the case may be, the<br /><br />
Defaulting Participant, of an intention to terminate the<br /><br />

may invoke its arbitration rights under Article 30 and thereby dispute<br /><br />
any such termination. If the Contractor or any Defaulting Participant<br /><br />
submits any matter to arbitration, then such submission shall not<br /><br />
suspend the effectiveness of a termination under Articles 29.2.1,<br /><br />
29.2.2 and 29.7. Further if there should be any violation of any law,<br /><br />

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE<br /><br />
SECTION I<br /><br />
GENERAL PROVISIONS<br /><br />
1.1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
PURPOSE<br /><br />
The accounting procedures included in this Accounting Procedure<br /><br />
establish a framework of accounting principles as generally accepted<br /><br />
within the international Petroleum industry. The purpose of this<br /><br />
Accounting Procedure is to establish a fair and equitable method for<br /><br />
accounting for Petroleum Operations under the Contract, to classify<br /><br />
expenditures, define Costs and Expenses and prescribe the manner in<br /><br />
which the Contractor's accounts shall be prepared and approved.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.2.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
DEFINITIONS<br /><br />
For the purpose of this Accounting Procedure the following terms shall<br /><br />
have the following meanings:<br /><br />
"Accepted Accounting Procedure" shall mean accounting principles,<br /><br />
practices and procedures generally accepted and recognised in the<br /><br />
international Petroleum industry.<br /><br />
"Accounting Procedure" shall mean the accounting principles, practices<br /><br />
and procedures set forth in this Annex C.<br /><br />
"Accruals Accounting Basis" shall mean the basis of accounting which<br /><br />
records the effect of transactions and events on financial conditions<br /><br />
and income when an obligation is created or a right arises.<br /><br />
"Contract" shall mean the production sharing contract this Accounting<br /><br />
Procedure is annexed to.<br /><br />
"Controllable Material" means all materials and equipment controlled<br /><br />
and inventoried by the Contractor. A list of types of such Controllable<br /><br />
Material shall be<br /><br />
128<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
furnished to Georgian Oil upon request.<br /><br />
"Material and Equipment" means property, including without limitation<br /><br />
all exploration, appraisal and development facilities together with<br /><br />
supplies and equipment, acquired and held for use in Petroleum<br /><br />
Operations.<br /><br />
The words and phrases defined in the Contract but not defined above<br /><br />
shall have the same meaning in this Accounting Procedure as is given to<br /><br />
them in the Contract.<br /><br />
1.3.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
AUDITS<br /><br />
1.3.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The State or Georgian Oil shall have the right to audit the<br /><br />
Contractor's accounts and records maintained under the<br /><br />
Contract with respect to each Calendar Year within two Years<br /><br />
from the end of each such Year as follows. Should Georgian Oil<br /><br />
decide not to perform its own audit, the audit may be<br /><br />
conducted by the State Agency. However, the audit may be<br /><br />
conducted instead by an independent auditor of international<br /><br />
standing familiar with international petroleum industry<br /><br />
practice in accordance with international auditing standards<br /><br />
at the request of Georgian Oil or the State Agency, but not<br /><br />
both. If audit is performed by an independent auditor, the<br /><br />
cost of such auditor should be borne by the Contractor and<br /><br />
treated as Costs and Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, it<br /><br />
is understood that Contractor shall be subject to no more than<br /><br />
one audit in total in a single Calendar Year.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.3.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any audit exceptions shall be made in writing and notified to<br /><br />
the Contractor within ninety (90) Days, following completion<br /><br />
of the audit in question, and failure to give such written<br /><br />
exception within such time shall be deemed to be an<br /><br />
acknowledgement of the correctness of the Contractor's books<br /><br />
and accounts.<br /><br />
129<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
1.3.3<br /><br />
<br /><br />
For purposes of auditing, the State or Georgian Oil may<br /><br />
examine and verify, upon providing at least sixty (60) days<br /><br />
advance notice to Contractor and at its sole expense, all<br /><br />
charges and credits relating to the Petroleum Operations, such<br /><br />
as books of account, accounting entries, material records and<br /><br />
inventories, vouchers, payrolls, invoices and any other<br /><br />
documents, correspondence and records including electronic<br /><br />
<br /><br />
records considered necessary by the State or Georgian Oil to<br /><br />
audit and verify the charges and credits. Furthermore, the<br /><br />
auditors shall have the right in connection with such audit,<br /><br />
to visit and inspect at reasonable times, all sites, plants,<br /><br />
facilities, warehouses and offices of the Contractor directly<br /><br />
or indirectly serving the Petroleum Operations and to question<br /><br />
personnel associated with those Operations. Where the State or<br /><br />
Georgian Oil requires verification of charges made by an<br /><br />
Affiliated Company of the Contractor, the State or Georgian<br /><br />
Oil shall have the right to obtain an audit certificate from<br /><br />
an internationally recognised firm of public accountants<br /><br />
acceptable to both the State or Georgian Oil and the<br /><br />
Contractor, which may be the Contractor's statutory auditor.<br /><br />
The auditors shall make every reasonable effort to conduct<br /><br />
their examination in a manner which will result in a minimum<br /><br />
of inconvenience to the Contractor<br /><br />
1.3.4<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The Contractor shall answer any notice of exception under<br /><br />
paragraph 1.3.2 within one hundred eighty (180) Days of the<br /><br />
receipt of such notice. Where the Contractor has, after the<br /><br />
said one hundred eighty (180) Days, failed to answer a notice<br /><br />
of exception the exception shall prevail.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.3.5<br /><br />
<br /><br />
All agreed adjustments resulting from an audit and all<br /><br />
adjustments required by prevailing exceptions shall be<br /><br />
promptly made in the Contractor's accounts and any<br /><br />
consequential adjustments to payments due to the State or<br /><br />
Georgian Oil shall be made promptly.<br /><br />
130<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
1.3.6<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Contractor and the State or Georgian Oil are unable to<br /><br />
reach final agreement on proposed audit adjustments they shall<br /><br />
refer their dispute for binding and final resolution by an<br /><br />
internationally recognised firm of independent public<br /><br />
accountants appointed in accordance with the procedures for<br /><br />
appointing a Sole Expert pursuant to Article 30 of the<br /><br />
Contract. When issues are outstanding with respect to an<br /><br />
audit, the Contractor shall maintain the relevant documents<br /><br />
and permit inspection thereof until the issue is resolved.<br /><br />

translating expenditures incurred in currencies other than<br /><br />
US$. Any gain or loss resulting from the exchange of<br /><br />
currencies required for Petroleum Operations and any fees or<br /><br />
other banking charges levied in connection with such exchange<br /><br />
of currencies or any gain or loss resulting from translation<br /><br />
of expenditures and sales revenues in accordance with the<br /><br />
provisions of Article 19.11 shall be included in Costs and<br /><br />
Expenses and recoverable from Cost Recovery Petroleum and<br /><br />
credited or charged to the Petroleum Operations Account.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

the Operating Company, up to the amount specified in the AFE, for the<br /><br />
Operating Company to implement the Project under the supervision of the<br /><br />
Project Manager. The Contractor may elect to discharge some or all of<br /><br />
the payments itself.<br /><br />
Should it appear that the Project cost is likely to exceed the AFE and<br /><br />
the sum advanced, the Project Manager shall prepare and submit a<br /><br />
supplementary AFE explaining the reasons for the cost increase and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
detailing the additional costs and, if necessary, timing changes.<br /><br />
Subject to approval of the supplementary AFE, the Contractor will<br /><br />
advance sufficient funds to the Operating Company for it to continue<br /><br />
with the Project.<br /><br />
At the completion (or at such other time as Contractor may require) of<br /><br />
each phase of a Project or other Petroleum Operations required by<br /><br />
Contractor, the Operating Company shall submit details of expenditure<br /><br />
to Contractor for Costs and Expenses incurred through each phase of the<br /><br />
Project (or for other Petroleum Operations required by Contractor) as<br /><br />
applicable to the AFE.<br /><br />
In the event that the expenditure is less than the sum advanced by the<br /><br />
Contractor, the Operating Company shall reimburse the difference to the<br /><br />
Contractor within 30 days of making the expenditure, or at such other<br /><br />
time as Contractor may require. The Contractor may opt to carry forward<br /><br />
such reimbursements.<br /><br />

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.1<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ARBITRATION If any dispute or claim between Contractor and the<br /><br />
Operating Company (in this Section 4.1, each a "disputing party")<br /><br />
arising out of this Agreement or the rights and duties of the<br /><br />
Contractor and the Operating Company arising out of this Agreement (in<br /><br />
this Section 4.1, a "claim") has not been resolved by mutual agreement<br /><br />
on or before the 30th day following the first notice of the subject<br /><br />
matter of the claim to or from the disputing parties, then any<br /><br />
disputing party may refer the claim to arbitration under the following<br /><br />
provisions:<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
To refer a claim to arbitration, a disputing party must<br /><br />
provide notice to the other disputing parties stating (a) a<br /><br />
general description of the claim and (b) that the claim is<br /><br />
being referred to arbitration under this Section 4.1. (the<br /><br />
"Notice").<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The disputing parties shall endeavour to agree promptly on a<br /><br />
panel of three arbitrators. If no agreement is reached within<br /><br />
30 days of receipt of the Notice either party may request the<br /><br />
panel of three arbitrators be appointed in accordance with the<br /><br />
rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The arbitration shall be conducted in London or such other<br /><br />
place as the disputing parties may agree. The arbitrators<br /><br />
shall set the date, the time, and the place of the hearing,<br /><br />
which must commence on or before the 30th day following the<br /><br />
designation of the third arbitrator. The hearing may be<br /><br />
adjourned to later times and dates as the arbitrators<br /><br />
determine. The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules<br /><br />
of the International Chamber of Commerce not inconsistent with<br /><br />
the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall<br /><br />
endeavour to notify any disputing parties not present of any<br /><br />
adjournment to other dates or places; however, the proceedings<br /><br />
may continue in the absence of any disputing party that has<br /><br />
received notice of the date, the time, and the place of the<br /><br />
initial session of the hearing. All hearings shall be<br /><br />
conducted in English.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iv)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The arbitrators shall endeavour to render their decision on or<br /><br />
before the 30th day following the last session of the hearing.<br /><br />
If the position of one or more disputing parties prevails,<br /><br />
then the other disputing party or parties shall pay all fees<br /><br />
and expenses of the arbitrators and the prevailing disputing<br /><br />
party in the arbitration. Each disputing party against which<br /><br />
the decision assesses a<br /><br />
187<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
monetary obligation shall pay that obligation on or before the<br /><br />
<br /><br />
30th day following the decision or such other date as the<br /><br />
decision may provide.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4.2<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(v)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The decisions of the arbitrators are final and binding on all<br /><br />
disputing parties and are not subject to appeal. Without<br /><br />
limiting the provisions of Section 4.2, the decisions of the<br /><br />
arbitrators may be enforced in any court of competent<br /><br />
jurisdiction, and the disputing parties authorise any such<br /><br />
court to enter judgement on the arbitrators' decisions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(vi)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each Party agrees that arbitration under this Section 4.1 is<br /><br />
the exclusive method for resolving any claim and that it will<br /><br />
not commence any action or proceeding based on a claim, except<br /><br />
to reinforce arbitrators' decisions as provided in section<br /><br />
4.1(v) or to compel the other Party to participate in<br /><br />
arbitration under this section 4.1.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
JURISDICTION<br /><br />
(i)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This Section 4.2 does not affect the limitations set forth in<br /><br />
Section 4.1 on commencing judicial proceedings, but may be<br /><br />
used to enforce arbitrators' decisions, to compel Parties to<br /><br />
participate in arbitration, or to compel Parties that have<br /><br />
brought judicial proceedings other than in compliance with<br /><br />
this Article 4 to dismiss those proceedings.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(ii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Any action arising out of this Agreement or the rights and<br /><br />
duties of the Parties arising out of this Agreement may be<br /><br />
brought, if at all, only in the courts of England and not in<br /><br />
any other jurisdiction, court or tribunal.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
(iii)<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each Party submits itself and its property to the personal<br /><br />
jurisdiction of the English courts in any such action. In this<br /><br />
connection, each Party waives any objection that now or in the<br /><br />
future it may have to the venue of any such action<br /><br />
188<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<PAGE><br /><br />
and any right to assert that the court is inconvenient, and<br /><br />
agrees not to raise any such objection or assertion. A copy of<br /><br />
this Agreement may serve as evidence of this waiver.<br /><br />
