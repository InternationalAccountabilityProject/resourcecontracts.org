Valuation and Measurement of Petroleum<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.1	 Crude oil sold by the Contractor to third parties shall be valued at the net realized<br /><br />
price at the delivery point received by the Contractor for such crude oil.<br /><br />
For purposes of this paragraph, "net realized price" means the price realized at<br /><br />
the delivery point as calculated by adjusting the price actually received at the<br /><br />
point of sale with allowable deductions. In calculating the net realized price,<br /><br />
deductions may only be made for (a) transportation costs between the delivery<br /><br />
point and the point of sale, (b) commissions and brokerages, and (c) handling<br /><br />
charges; and the deductions shall be limited to amounts that do not exceed<br /><br />
customary and prevailing rates charged therefor in the intemational oil industry<br /><br />
between independent parties in arm's length commercial transactions.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2	 Crude oil sold by the Contractor to other than third parties shall be valued as<br /><br />
follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.2.1 By using the weighted average unit price received by the Contractor from saies to<br /><br />
third parties at the delivery point, net of any commissions and brokerages paid in<br /><br />
relation to such third party sales, dUring the ninety (90) days preceding such sale,<br /><br />
adjusted as necessary for quality, grade and graVity, and laking into<br /><br />
consideration any special circumstances with respect to such sales, unless less<br /><br />
<br /><br />
than fifty percent (50%), by volume, of crude oil sales during such period are<br /><br />
made to third parties, in which case crude oil sold to other than third parties shall<br /><br />
be valued in accordance with paragraph 10.2.2.<br /><br />
10.2.2 If no third party sales have been made during such period of time, then (a) on the<br /><br />
basis used to value other crude oil from Belize of similar quality, grade and<br /><br />
gravity (or, if not similar, adjusted as necessary for quality, grade and gravity) and<br /><br />
taking into consideration any special circumstances with respect to sales of such<br /><br />
<br /><br />
crude oil, or (b) if there is no other crude oil from Belize, on the basis used to<br /><br />
value crude oil from other sources in the Central America, Colombia and<br /><br />
Venezuela of similar quality, grade and graVity and taking into consideration any<br /><br />
special circumstances with respect to sales of such similar crude oil.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.3	 Natural gas shall be valued in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 14.4.<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Northern Spirit Resources<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.4	 Third party sales referred to in this Article shall mean sales other than barter<br /><br />
sales made by the Contractor to purchasers that are not affiliated companies of<br /><br />
the Contractor in arm's length transactions and with whom (at the time the same<br /><br />
<br /><br />
is made) the Contractor has no contractual interest involving directly or indirectly<br /><br />
any joint interest.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.5	 The Contractor shall, prtor to initial commercial production in any field, carry out<br /><br />
an assay of the crude oil from such field for its valuation and shall promptly<br /><br />
submit the results of such assay to the Government.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
10.6	 In the event that petroleum operations involve the segregation of crude oils of<br /><br />
different quality, grade or gravity, and if the parties do not otherwise mutually<br /><br />
agree, any and all provisions of this Agreement concerning valuation of crude oil<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall separately apply to each segregated crude oil. However, in electing to take<br /><br />
crude oil for internal consumption pursuant to paragraph 11.7 and to take royalty<br /><br />
in kind pursuant to paragraph 11.2, the Government shall have the rtght to<br /><br />
receive, crude oil of the quality, grade and gravity of its choice.<br /><br />
10.7	 The Contractor shall supply, operate and maintain equipment for measurtng the<br /><br />
volume and quality of the petroleum produced and saved hereunder, including<br /><br />
gravity, density, temperature and pressure measuring devices and any other<br /><br />
devices that may be required. All measurement equipment and devices shall,<br /><br />
<br /><br />
prtor to their installation or usage, be approved by the Inspector of Petroleum.<br /><br />
Such equipment and devices shall at all reasonable times be available for<br /><br />
inspection and testing by the Inspector of Petroleum or other authortzed<br /><br />
representatives. Any such inspection or testing shall not interfere with the normal<br /><br />
<br /><br />
operation of the facilities involved. The equipment and devices used or installed<br /><br />
pursuant to this paragraph shall not be replaced or altered without the prtor<br /><br />
approval of the Govemment.<br /><br />
10.8	 The Contractor shall undertake to measure the volume and quality of the<br /><br />
petroleum produced and saved hereunder, consistent with generally accepted<br /><br />
practices in the international petroleum industry, with the frequency and<br /><br />
according to procedures which shall be approved by the Government.<br /><br />
10.9	 The Contractor shall give the Inspector of PetrOleum timely notice of its intention<br /><br />
to conduct measuring operations and the Inspector shall have the right to be<br /><br />
present at and supervise, either directly or through authorized representatives,<br /><br />
such operations.<br /><br />

10.10 If it is determined, following an inspection or test carried out by the Govemment<br /><br />
or its representatives, that the equipment, devices or procedures used for<br /><br />
measurement are inaccurate and exceed the permissible tolerances which shall<br /><br />
be established by agreement between the Govemment and the Contractor, and<br /><br />
such determination is verified by an independent surveyor acceptable to both<br /><br />
parties, such inaccuracy shall be deemed to have existed for one-half of the<br /><br />
period since the last previous such inspection or test, unless it is proved that such<br /><br />
inaccuracy has been in existence for a longer or shorter period, Appropriate<br /><br />
adjustments covering such period shall be made within thirty (30) days from the<br /><br />
date of such determination.<br /><br />

so notify the Contractor in writing not less than siXty (60) days prior to the<br /><br />
commencement of each six month semester of each calendar year specifying the<br /><br />
quantity, and designating the grade and quality that it elects to take in kind,<br /><br />
based upon estimates, including those contained in the forecast statement<br /><br />
furnished pursuant to paragraph 6.3.2. Final adjustments shall be made within<br /><br />
ninety (gO) days of the end of each calendar year on the basis of actual<br /><br />
quantities. Such notice shall be effective for the ensuing six month semester of<br /><br />
that calendar year. Failure to give such notice shall be conclusively deemed to<br /><br />
indicate the election by the Govemment not to take in kind.<br /><br />
11.3	 Any sale by the Contractor of any part of the Govemment's share of crude oil<br /><br />
production shall not be for a term expiring more than six (6) months after the date<br /><br />
of execution of the sales contract without the Government's written consent. If<br /><br />
the Government so consents, the Government shall not exercise its rights to<br /><br />
receive crude oil in kind pursuant to paragraph 11.2.<br /><br />
11.4	 Any sale by the Contractor of any part of its share of the crude oil produced and<br /><br />
saved from the contract area shall not be for a term expiring more than twelve<br /><br />

Government's written consent. If the Government so consents, the Government<br /><br />
shall not exercise its rights under paragraph 11.7 to require the Contractor to<br /><br />
satisfy the internal consumption requirements of Belize from crude oil which is<br /><br />
subject to such contract.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
11.5	 Crude oil which the Government has eleeled to take in kind shall be delivered by<br /><br />
the Contraelor, free of cost to the Government, at regularly spaced intervals at<br /><br />
the delivery point or to the Government's storage facilrlies in the field, or both, at<br /><br />
the option of the Government. The Government shall provide at such delivery<br /><br />
points, at its sole expense, all storage, transportation and other facilities<br /><br />
necessary to receive such crude oil, provided, however, that if the Government<br /><br />
requests, the Contraelor shall provide adequate storage facilities at such places.<br /><br />
free of charge, at the risk of the Government, for a quantity of the Government's<br /><br />
crude oil not exceeding one hundred thousand (100,000) barrels for each fieid. If<br /><br />
storage exceeds one hundred thousand (100,000) barrels per field at any time,<br /><br />
the Government shall pay to the Contractor a reasonable storage charge for such<br /><br />
excess.<br /><br />
11.6	 If the Government elects to meet all or part of the reqUirements of the domestic<br /><br />
market of Belize from crude oil produelion in Belize, it shall use its share of<br /><br />
production from all crude oil production in Belize to do so. If in any year there is<br /><br />
domestic demand in excess of the Government's share of such production, the<br /><br />
Govemment may require the Contractor to sell crude oil in Belize on a pro rata<br /><br />
basis with other producers in Belize, according to the quantity of crude oil<br /><br />
produelion of each producer in each year. The Government shall give the<br /><br />
Contraelor at least three (3) months notice in advance of such requirement and<br /><br />
the term of supply will be on an annual basis. The price for such sales shall be<br /><br />
the price as calculated pursuant to paragraph 10.2 above.<br /><br />
11.7	 If the Government eleels to exercise Its rights under paragraph 11.6, it shall notify<br /><br />
the Contraelor in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 11.2 relating to the<br /><br />
Government's eleelion to take royalty payment in kind. The amounts to be taken<br /><br />
shall be based upon estimates, inclUding those contained in the forecast<br /><br />
statement furnished pursuant to paragraph 6.3.2, and final adjustments shall be<br /><br />
made within ninety (90) days of the end of each calendar year on the basis of<br /><br />
actual quantities.<br /><br />
11.8	 Not less than twelve (12) months prior to inrliai commercial produelion in any<br /><br />

14.1	 The Contractor shall have the right to use associated natural gas for petroleum<br /><br />
operations, including re-injection for pressure maintenance in the field or adjacent<br /><br />
<br /><br />
fields of the Contractor. Associated natural gas which is, in the opinion of both<br /><br />
the Contractor and the Govemment, not economical, shall be retumed to the<br /><br />
subsurface structure, or may be flared with the consent of the Government. In<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the event that the Contractor chooses to process and sell associated natural gas,<br /><br />
the Contractor shall notify the Government of the same and upon such<br /><br />
notification, the Government and the Contractor shall, as soon as practicable<br /><br />
thereafter, meet together with a view to reaching an agreement on<br /><br />
the<br /><br />

not to process and sell associated natural gas, the Government may elect to off­<br /><br />
<br /><br />
take at the outlet flange of the gas-oil separator and use such associated natural<br /><br />
gas which is not required for petroleum operations. There shall be no charge to<br /><br />
the Government for such associated natural gas, proVided that the cost to gather<br /><br />
such associated natural gas in the field at the point of being flared and to process<br /><br />
and utilize it shall be for the account of the Government.<br /><br />
