("Mobil", the predecessor in the interest to ExxonMobil) and the DRSTP entered into that certain Technical Assistance Agreement ("TAA") of 18 September 1998 under which, among other things, Mobil agreed to make certain bonus payments and undertake specified technical evaluation, which bonus payments and technical evaluation were made and completed; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
WHEREAS, the DRSTP and the Federal Republic of Nigeria ("Nigeria") have agreed to terms and conditions of a Treaty between them for the Joint Development of Petroleum and other Resources ("Treaty") covering a specified area (the "Joint Development Zone" or JDZ") that includes the area for which ExxonMobil and DRSTP have been working to conclude a PSC under the TAA; and recognizing the desire of the DRSTP and Nigeria to resolve third party claims as provided for in Article 46 of the Treaty; and<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WHEREAS, the DRSTP and Nigeria have agreed that interests in the JDZ will be managed by a Joint Development Authority ("JDA"), composed of representatives from both the DRSTP and Nigeria; and ExxonMobil, as consideration for entering into this Agreement has agreed to relinquish its rights under the TAA, including the right to enter into a PSC pursuant to the TAA.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the expenditures, releases, waivers and other good and valuable consideration, the DRSTP and ExxonMobil agree as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
WAIVER OF PRIOR RIGHTS AND GRANTS OF PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS<br /><br />

[signature]<br /><br />
1Recognizing the JDA's authority to define block size in the JDZ, and recognizing that the Parties understand that such block boundaries and sizes have been proposed to the Joint Ministerial Council for approval as shown in "Attachment A" to this Agreement. Now it being understood by the Parties to this Agreement that the size of such blocks will be approximately the same size as those set out in Attachment A, and the configuration of such blocks shall be substantially similar to that set out in Attachment A, the Parties to this Agreement agree that ExxonMobil is hereby granted preferential rights to participate in JDZ acreage (Preferential Rights) as follows:<br /><br />
<br /><br />
• ExxonMobil may elect to select one block from blocks offered in any part of the area of the Joint Development Zone, and acquire a 40% interest in this block by either: 1) agreeing to pay 40% of the first confirmed, bona fide, high bid for the block, consistent with the terms and conditions of the license round, and agreeing to the terms and conditions of the PSC, or other grant of rights to the block (if such block is offered in a license round); or 2) by agreeing to pay 40% of the negotiated PSC, or other grant of rights, signing bonus, and agreeing to the terms and conditions associated with such PSC or grant of rights (if such block is not offered in a license round). (Bona Fide high bid, for purposes of this Settlement Agreement, is understood to mean the high bid made by a party having the technical and financial capability to satisfy such bid and to conduct exploration, development and production operations on the block); and in addition<br /><br />
• ExxonMobil may elect to select a second block from blocks offered in any part of the area of the Joint Development Zone, and acquire a 25% interest in this block by either: 1) agreeing to pay 25% of the first confirmed, bona fide, high bid for the block, consistent with the terms and conditions of the license round, and agreeing to the terms and conditions of the PSC, or other grant of rights to the block (if such block is offered in a license round); or 2) by agreeing to pay 25% of the negotiated PSC, or other grant of rights, signing bonus, and agreeing to the terms and conditions associated with such PSC or grant of rights (if such block is not offered in a license round); and in addition<br /><br />
• ExxonMobil may elect to select a third block from blocks offered in any part of the area of the Joint Development Zone, and acquire a 25% interest in the block by either: 1) agreeing to pay 25% of the first confirmed, bona fide, high bid for the block, consistent with the terms and conditions of the license round, and agreeing to the terms and conditions of the PSC, or other grant of rights to the block (if such block is offered in a license round); or 2) by agreeing to pay 25% of the negotiated PSC, or other grant of rights, signing bonus, and agreeing to the terms and conditions associated with such PSC or grant of rights (if such block is not offered in a license round).<br /><br />
• Subject to the approval of the JDA, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, ExxonMobil may elect under this Agreement to be Operator of any one of the three blocks referenced above in which it is the highest equity holder in the block, or in which its equity interest is substantially similar to the otherwise highest equity holder.<br /><br />
[signature]TIME IN WHICH TO EXERCISE<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The JDA shall provide ExxonMobil initial notice of the high bid for any block offered in the JDZ; ExxonMobil shall have one (1) week from the time of receipt of such initial notice in which to notify the JDA if it desires additional information on any such bid. ExxonMobil shall have thirty (30) days, from the date of receipt of any additional information requested and verification of the formal notification of the high bid and associated final terms and conditions and any PSC signing bonus, in which to elect to exercise its Preferential Right under this Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
AGREEMENT TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTION<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Consistent with the Treaty, the DRSTP shall undertake all necessary actions to effectuate the Preferential Rights set out in this Agreement, including approval of this Agreement by the Joint Ministerial Council.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
SEISMIC DATA<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Subject to any obligation to purchase an initial seismic survey from a specified seismic vendor, as may be set out in the terms and conditions of a license round or PSC by the JDA, the Parties agree that ExxonMobil shall have the right to conduct seismic activity in any block it may select under this Agreement.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
CONFIDENTIALITY<br /><br />
<br /><br />
ExxonMobil and the DRSTP, its agents and representatives, agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be kept confidential. The Parties agree, however, that the DRSTP shall disclose this Agreement to all members of the JDA, and the Parties shall also be free to disclose this Agreement to such government representatives of Nigeria, who may have a reasonable need to know of its existence. Further, the DRSTP will seek to have the JDA disclose the existence of this Preferential Right to bidders in any licensing round for which the Preferential Right still exists without disclosing the financial or other terms for such Preferential Right hereunder. ExxonMobil may disclose the terms of this Agreement if it is required to disclose the Agreement by applicable law or regulation and may disclose this Agreement to its Affiliates.

<br /><br />
ASSIGNMENT<br /><br />
<br /><br />
