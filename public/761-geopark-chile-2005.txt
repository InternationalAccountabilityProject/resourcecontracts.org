Contractor shall consist of surfaces of the appropriate size and shape to further perform Exploration Operations, at the<br /><br />
Coordination Committee’s discretion. Notwithstanding the obligation to return the areas under this Article Five.Three, Contractor<br /><br />
shall not be obliged to return Field Exploitation Areas or Commercially Exploitable Fields, including the Protection Halation<br /><br />
surrounding these areas. At the end of the Seventh Exploration Period, and provided the exploration stage is still in force,<br /><br />
Contractor shall return fifty per cent of the remaining Contract Area, or the total remaining Contract Area if Contractor has not<br /><br />
informed the Ministry of Mining in charge of Field Exploitation Areas or Commercially Exploitable Fields of his decision to<br /><br />
continue with the complementary exploration stage. Five.Four. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor may return the total<br /><br />
Contract Area at the end of the Seventh Exploration Period, if Contractor has submitted a new exploration program including the<br /><br />
whole Contract Area, at the full satisfaction of the Ministry of Mining, six months before the expiration of the Sixth Exploration<br /><br />
Period. Five.Five. At the completion of the exploration stage and, in order to carry out Oil Operations, Contractor shall only keep<br /><br />
<br /><br />
the Field Exploitation Areas with regards to which the correction term stated in Article Six.Three has expired, and a provisional<br /><br />
protection area up to one hundred square kilometers, which shall be established by the Coordination Committee at the request of<br /><br />
Contractor on the basis of the technical information available by then for each of the following: (i) Commercially Exploitable<br /><br />
Fields which have been put into Production at least one year before the termination date of the Exploration Stage; (ii) Fields<br /><br />
declared as Commercially Exploitable Fields that have not been put into Production; and (iii) Hydrocarbon Discoveries which<br /><br />
terms to declare them as Commercially Exploitable Fields in the final Field Exploitation Area of each field under<br /><br />
Article Six.Three have not expired. Contractor shall return all the corresponding surfaces not included in said areas to the<br /><br />
Government, unless the Government and Contractor agree on additional Oil Operations for the above-mentioned surfaces with<br /><br />
their corresponding work commitments. Five.Six. When Contractor returns the Government the whole Contract Area that, in<br /><br />
accordance with the previous article, does not constitute Field Exploitation Areas, Contractor shall be released from all future<br /><br />
rights and obligations in connection with the returned area, except for those obligations corresponding to the Contractual Year in<br /><br />
force at that time and, subject to the legal rules in force, Contractor shall freely dispose of and use the equipment, machineries<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
<br /><br />
and installations used in the Exploration Operations. Five.Seven. If at any time during the exploitation stage, Contractor decides to<br /><br />
finally stop the exploitation of a particular field, Contractor shall give six-month written notice to the Minister to that effect.<br /><br />
Contractor shall return the Field Exploitation Area pertaining to that field to the Government and the wells, equipment,<br /><br />
machineries and materials directly and exclusively used in the exploitation of that field, which shall be free of charge according to<br /><br />
Article Eighteen.Four. Accordingly, Contractor shall have no further rights or obligations in connection with that field.<br /><br />

SEVEN. ARTICLE SEVEN. HYDROCARBON MEASUREMENT, TRANSPORTATION AND DELIVERY. Seven.One.<br /><br />
Oil. Seven.One.One. The Oil produced in each Field Exploitation Area shall be measured at the Measurement Station of the<br /><br />
corresponding area and transported by Contractor to the Oil Terminal Facilities where the net production of the whole Contract<br /><br />
Area shall be measured, including the Field Exploitation Areas under the conditions stated in Article Seven.One.Five. These<br /><br />
measurements shall conform to the rules and methods accepted in the oil industry. The Oil Compensation shall be transferred to<br /><br />
Contractor at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil. Seven.One.Two. Contractor shall be responsible<br /><br />
for the equipment, construction, maintenance and operation of the Collection System, Oil Pipeline and Oil terminal Facilities.<br /><br />
These facilities shall comply with the safety and operation requirements applied in the oil industry. Seven.One.Three. Contractor<br /><br />
<br /><br />
shall be responsible for the Oil produced in the Contract Area and for the transportation of that Oil and the Oil<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
<br /><br />
referred to in Article Seven.One.Five, to the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil, where the Parties shall<br /><br />
take their proportional parts of each Oil quality. These operations shall be carried out in accordance with the rules and methods<br /><br />
accepted in the international oil industry. Seven.One.Four. The Oil to be delivered by Contractor to the Government at the Point<br /><br />
of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil, including the volume reacquired under Article Eight.One.Four, shall meet<br /><br />
the commercial conditions of delivery, measured at that place, and shall be reduced to dry-dry conditions at sixty degrees<br /><br />
Fahrenheit. The maximum limit of basic sediments and water shall be one per cent and the maximum limit of total salinity shall be<br /><br />
one hundred grams per cubic meter expressed in sodium chloride, both limits corrected for a temperature of sixty degrees<br /><br />
Fahrenheit. If the water or Oil salinity exceeds the stated limits, the Government shall not be obliged to receive it. The Oil that is<br /><br />
not received by the Government due to said reason shall be treated once again by Contractor until the above-mentioned limits are<br /><br />
reached. However, the Government may voluntarily desist from following the previous commercial conditions of delivery. In<br /><br />
special cases, if Contractor is unable to reach the stated limits due to serious operative reasons approved by the Coordination<br /><br />
Committee, the Government shall receive the Oil out of specifications up to a maximum of two hundred and forty hours in a<br /><br />
Calendar Year. In these cases, the volume of Oil to be delivered by Contractor to the Government shall be increased to a volume<br /><br />
which percentage shall be equal to the highest of the following values: (i) The one resulting from multiplying the percentage of<br /><br />
basic sediments and water contained in the volumes delivered out of specifications by two; or (ii) the one resulting from dividing<br /><br />
the total salinity contained in the volumes delivered out of specification by fifty. The quantity and quality of Oil to be delivered by<br /><br />
Contractor to the Government at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil shall be certified by a qualified<br /><br />
inspector appointed by Contractor and accepted by the Minister. The certification shall be reasonably made as needed according to<br /><br />
the practices generally accepted in the international oil industry. Seven.One.Five. If during the validity term of this Contract, the<br /><br />
Government decides to produce Oil directly or through its companies or third parties in a Field Exploitation Area returned by<br /><br />
Contractor under Article Five.Six, the Government or the third parties, as the case may be, shall operate the area and the part<br /><br />
corresponding to the Collection System at<br /><br />
23<br /><br />
<br /><br />
its own cost and risk up to the point where the Oil of that area is mixed with the Oil coming from other Field Exploitation Areas<br /><br />
which were not returned by Contractor. At that point of the Collection System, Contractor shall install a measurement device and<br /><br />
transport the Oil produced by the Government or a third party, as the case may be, from the above-mentioned point to the Oil<br /><br />
Terminal Facilities under the following conditions: (i) If the facilities have capacity available, the Government or a third party, as<br /><br />
the case may be, shall pay the proportional part of the operational costs of the facilities used. This right shall be limited to a<br /><br />
maximum equal to the average of the Monthly Average Production per Day of the Field Exploitation Area returned, calculated<br /><br />
based on the previous five production years to the date when the area is returned. If there are not five previous production years, it<br /><br />
shall be calculated based on the years of effective production. If at the time this right is to be exercised there is not enough<br /><br />
capacity, the Government’s right shall be limited to the capacity effectively available at that time and it may subsequently use the<br /><br />
capacities that become available up to the maximum limit stated above. This right shall be exercised for a maximum period of<br /><br />
twenty years counted as from the date when the Field Exploitation Area is returned. This right shall forfeit if the Government or a<br /><br />
third party, as the case may be, fails to exercise the right within the first five years from that date; (ii) if the facilities have no<br /><br />
available capacity, the Government or a third party, as the case may be, may expand, at its own cost, the capacity of the facilities<br /><br />
owned by Contractor by paying only the proportional part of the operational costs of the facilities used. Seven.One.Six. Before<br /><br />
starting the Oil production and upon proposal made by Contractor, the Coordination Committee shall establish the procedures on<br /><br />
the Oil-pick ups to which each Party is entitled, at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil. Said<br /><br />
procedures shall include, among others, the requirements for the oil tank-vessels loading, volumes, nominations, overstays and<br /><br />
pick-ups of larger or smaller quantity than those agreed. The procedures shall be established before the first Oil delivery by<br /><br />
Contractor at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Oil. Seven.Two. Gas. Seven.Two.One. If Contractor<br /><br />
considers that all or part of the Gas discovered in the Contract Area can be sold, the sale of the Gas shall be subject to a previous<br /><br />
agreement of the Parties with regard to: (i) Place, within the Contract Area, where the Point of Delivery, Control and Final<br /><br />
Measurement of the Gas shall be located; (ii) conditions of the Gas<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
<br /><br />
delivery and quality at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Gas; and (iii) price of the Gas at the Point of<br /><br />
Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Gas according to Article Nine.Four. Seven.Two.Two. After the Liquid<br /><br />
Hydrocarbons are removed through regular separation in the field, the Marketable Gas produced and recovered in each Field<br /><br />
Exploitation Area, shall be measured at the Measurement Station of the respective area according to the rules and methods<br /><br />
accepted in the international Gas industry and it shall be transported by Contractor to the Point of Delivery, Control and Final<br /><br />
Measurement of the Gas agreed upon by the Parties. Seven.Two.Three. Contractor shall be responsible for the Marketable Gas<br /><br />
produced in the Contract Area and for the transportation of the Gas to the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the<br /><br />
Gas, where it shall be delivered to the Government. The quantity and quality of the Gas delivered by Contractor to the<br /><br />
Government at the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Gas shall be certified by a qualified inspector<br /><br />
appointed by Contractor and accepted by the Minister. The certification shall be issued with founded reasons and as reasonably<br /><br />
needed in accordance with the practices generally accepted in the international Gas industry. Seven.Two.Four. Contractor shall be<br /><br />
responsible for the construction, maintenance and operation equipment of the Marketable Gas Collection System. These facilities<br /><br />
shall meet all safety and operation requirements applied in the international Gas industry. The construction and operation of any of<br /><br />
the facilities beyond the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of the Gas, are not included within the scope of this<br /><br />

processing and use of all or part of the Gas of a Field Exploitation Area is not commercially viable or there are founded technical<br /><br />
reasons, Contractor may re-inject Gas as a part of the program for the operation of the reservoir. If Contractor requests<br /><br />
authorization to burn or vent the Gas, the Government may take and use the Gas free of charge, and the collection costs of this Gas<br /><br />
shall be borne by the Government at its own risk and expense. Seven.Two.Six. If during the validity term of this Contract, the<br /><br />
Government decides to produce Gas directly or through its companies or third parties in a Field Exploitation Area returned by<br /><br />
Contractor under Article Five.Six, the Government or the third parties, as the case may be, shall operate the area and the part<br /><br />
corresponding to the Collection System at its own cost and risk up to the point where the<br /><br />
25<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Gas of the area is mixed with the Gas coming from other Field Exploitation Areas which were not returned by Contractor. At that<br /><br />
point of the Collection System, Contractor shall install a measurement device and transport the Gas produced by the Government<br /><br />
or a third party, as the case may be, from the above-mentioned point to the Point of Delivery, Control and Final Measurement of<br /><br />
the Gas under the following conditions: (i) If the facilities have capacity available, the Government or a third party, as the case<br /><br />
may be, shall pay the proportional part of the operational costs of the facilities used. This right shall be limited to a maximum<br /><br />
equal to the average of the Monthly Average Production per Day of the Field Exploitation Area returned, calculated based on the<br /><br />
previous five production years to the date when the area is returned. If at the time this right is to be exercised there is not enough<br /><br />
capacity, the Government’s right shall be limited to the capacity effectively available at that time and it may subsequently use the<br /><br />
capacities that become available up to the maximum limit stated above. This right shall be exercised for a maximum period of<br /><br />
twenty years counted as from the date when the Field Exploitation Area is returned. This right shall forfeit if the Government or a<br /><br />
third party, as the case may be, fails to exercise the right within the first five years from that date; (ii) if the facilities have no<br /><br />
available capacity, the Government or a third party, as the case may be, may expand, at its own cost, the capacity of the facilities<br /><br />
owned by Contractor by paying only the proportional part of the operational costs of the facilities used. Seven.Three. To help<br /><br />
Contractor perform his obligations to transport the Oil and Gas under this Contract, the Government agrees to make its best<br /><br />
endeavors to obtain access for Contractor to the available capacity in oil pipelines, gas pipelines, storage terminals and water<br /><br />
collection and separation facilities owned by third parties or by the Government, at a reasonable and fair cost for all the parties<br /><br />
involved.<br /><br />

Party may issue a notice of breach. Nineteen.Two. If Notice has been served regarding an alleged breach, the Second Party shall<br /><br />
remedy the alleged breach without delay or, if this is related to an obligation that, due its nature, cannot be reasonably remedied<br /><br />

Notice indicates that Contractor has stopped performing the obligations set forth in Article Four.Two and Four.Three, or the<br /><br />
commitment referred to in Article Three.Four herein, the period of time Contractor shall have to remedy the breach shall not<br /><br />
exceed ninety days from the date of Notice. If the alleged breach is not remedied within the period of time applicable under this<br /><br />
